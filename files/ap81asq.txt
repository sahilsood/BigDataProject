The authors are indebted  toa number of their colleagues, particularly  Robert Dubin and Lyman Porter, for t h e ~ r   helpful comments on an earlier verslon of  this paper.  Thestudy attempts to relate the organizational commitment  of lower-level employees to organizational effectiveness in  organizations offering bus services. Organizational com-  mitment was found to be associated with organizational  adaptability, turnover, and tardiness rate, but not with  operating costs or absenteeism. Two subscales were con-  structed to measure value commitment and commitment to  stay in the organization. Few significant differences were  found between the subscales, as they relate to various  indicators of organizational effectiveness, and the overall  pattern suggested the need to avoid simplisticassumptions  about the impact of commitment on organizationally rele-  vant behavior:  In a widely accepted paradigm in organization theory, organiza-  tions and their members are seen in an exchange relationship.  Each party makes certain demands on the other while providing  something in return. March and Simon (1958) characterized  such an exchange in terms of organizational inducements and  individual contributions. They pointed out that employees'  contributions to the organization take two general forms - they described some impor-  production and participation -and  tant differences in the antecedents of an employee's decision  to produce in contrast to the decision to participate.  Students of organizational behavior have attempted to estab-  lish reliable linkages between employee attitudes and organiza-  tionally relevant behaviors, though with mixed results (Vroom,  1964). Substantial attention has been directed recently toward  organizational commitment as the attitudinal component of this  relationship (Hrebiniakand Alutto, 1972; Buchanan, 1974;  Porter et al., 1974; Porter, Crampon and Smith, 1976; Steers,  1977a; Stevens, Beyer and Trice,  1978). Some have proposed  that the concept of commitment may disclose reliable linkages  between attitudes and behavior, because commitment is pre-  sumed to be a relatively stable employeeattribute (Porter et al.,  1974; Koch and Steers, 1978).  Commitment has been studied from so many different theoret-  ical perspectives, however, that Hall (1 977) remarked that we  might better abanaon the term altogether and deal instead with  a set of concepts, each focused on one or another aspect of  commitment. The term "commitment"  has been used, for  example, to describe such diverse phenomena as the willing-  ness of social actors to give their energy and loyalty to social  systems (Kanter, 1968), an awareness of the impossibility of  choosing a different social identity or of rejecting a particular  expectation, under force of penalty (Stebbins, 1970a), the  binding of an individual to behavioral acts (Kiesler, 1971 ;  Salancik, 1977), or an affective attachment to an organization  apart from the purely instrumental worth of the relationship  (Buchanan, 1974). Some commitmentlike concepts, such as  organizational identification or organizational involvement, have  also appeared in the literature (Patchen, 1970; Hall and  Schneider, 1972).  The commitment framework adopted in the present research  has been called the "organizational behavior approach"  (Staw,  1977). This treatment of commitment has perhaps its most  frequently cited origins in the work of Porter and his associates  March 1981, volume 26  1/Administrative Science Quarterly  (Porter and Smith, 1970; Porter et al., 1974; Porter, Crampon  and Smith, 1976; Steers,  1977a; Mowday, Steers and Porter,  1979) and a similar concept is found in other research by Hall,  Schneider and Nygren (1 970), Hall and Schneider (1972) and  Buchanan (I974).  Organizational commitment as defined by Porter et al. (1 974)  has three major components: (1) a strong belief in and accep-  tance of the organization's goals, (2) a willingness to exert  considerable effort on behalf of the organization, and (3)a  definite desire to maintain organizational membership. Re-  search conducted within this framework has indicated that  commitment is not only a predictor of employee retention  (Porter et al., 1974; Koch and Steers,  1978), but may also be a  predictor of employee effort and performance (Mowday, Por-  ter, and Dubin, 1974; Mowday, Steers, and Porter, 1979).  Organizational Commitment and Organizational  Effectiveness  Organizational theorists seem to agree that organizational ef-  fectiveness is multidimensional (Campbell et al., 1974; Steers,  1977b), and there is also reason to believe that the determi-  nants of organizational effectiveness vary (Steers, 1977a; Ste-  vens, Beyer, and Trice, 1978). Although general organizational  theory  holds that the structural features of an organization  should fit the demands of environment and technology (Burns  and Stalker, 1961 ; Woodward, 1965; Lawrence and Lorsch,  1967), organizational design, alone, will not ensure organiza-  tional effectiveness. Even where the structural prerequisites  have been met, there remains a crucial requirement-that  the  members of the organization behave in a manner supportive of  organizational goals.  Katz (1 964) suggested three types of member behaviors,  reminiscent of March and Simon's (1 958) participation and  production framework, essential for a functioning organization.  Not only must the organization induce members to join and  remain (i.e., participate), but it must also motivate two kinds of  production: dependable role behavior, as prescribed by the  organization, and spontaneous and innovative behaviors which  go beyond explicit behavioral prescriptions.  Some parallels can be drawn between the elements of organi-  zational commitment according to the organizational behavior  school (Porter et al., 1974) and the motivational taxonomies of  March and Simon (1 958) and Katz (1 964). A committed  member's definite desire to maintain organizational member-  ship would have a clear relationship to the motivation to  participate. Willingness to exert considerable effort on behalf of  the organization and the belief in and acceptance of the  organization's goals, in combination,  have implications for the  member's motivation to produce for the organization -in  accordance with explicit organizational mandates, as well as in  terms of Katz's (1 964) spontaneous and innovative behaviors.  Expected Relationships  In the present research, it had been anticipated that several  measures of organizational effectiveness would be sensitive to  differences in the levels of commitment of the members of the  organizations studied. Thus, it was hypothesized that organiza-  tions whose members were strongly committed would have  Organizational Commitment and Effectiveness  both high participation and high production. Such organizations  were therefore expected to show relatively low levels of  absenteeism, tardiness, and voluntary turnover, and high levels  of operating efficiency. In addition, in keeping with the view  that committed employees will engage in spontaneous, innova-  tive behaviors on behalf of the organization, it was anticipated  that, within limits, organizational commitment among the  members would facilitate the ability of an organization to adapt  to contingencies. The adaptability-commitment relationship  would not actually be expected to be monotonic over all  possible levels of commitment. Extreme commitment would  probably lead to fanatical behavior, suspension of individual  judgment and the like, i.e., the syndrome that Schein (1968)  termed "failures of socialization." However, the relationship  was presumed to be positive and monotonic over the range of  values actually encountered. While these outcomes are not  exhaustive, they are typical of the measures of effectiveness  that have appeared in the literature based on the goal model of  organizations (Campbell et al., 1974; Steers,  197713).  It was anticipated that the relative strength of the relationship  between organizational commitment and organizational effec-  tiveness mig htvary depending upon the behaviors to which the  employees were committed. Harris and Eoyang (1 977), building  upon Steers' (1 977a) notion of "active"  and "passive"  com- mitment, offered a fourfold typology of commitment as a  construct having two bipolar dimensions: (1) commitment, or  lack of commitment, to remain with the organization, and (2)  commitment, or lack thereof, to work in support of organiza-  tional objectives. Within such a framework, turnover measures  should be most sensitive to the extent to which employees  were committed to remaining in the organization. Conversely,  those measures that more nearly reflected a decision by  organizational members to produce (March and Simon,  1958)  should be more clearly related to their commitment to exert  effort on behalf of the organization. The latter category of  indicators includes not only such performance dimensions as  service efficiency and adaptability,  but absenteeism and tardi-  ness, as well. Although the term "participation"  in common  usage includes employee behaviors opposite to absenteeism,  as well as to turnover,  March and Simon (1 958) defined the  term solely with respect to turnover.  METHOD  Sample and Research Sites  A total of 24 organizations, which operated fixed-route bus  services in western United States, participated in the study.  Archival and transit manager questionnaire and interview data  were collected at all participating organizations, and employee  questionnaires were administered to members of the bus  drivers' bargaining unit. Consequently, a majority (91 percent) of  the respondents were bus drivers;  however, at a few of the  participating organizations, mechanics andlor clerical personnel  were included in the drivers' bargaining unit and so were  sampled along with the drivers. The total employee sample was  1244, while the transit manager sample was 96.  The nature of the bus driver's job was expected to provide a  particularly sensitive test of the relationship between the  commitment of rank-and-file employees and several indicators  of the effectiveness of their employing organizations. Driving a  bus is one of the more controlled yet one of the more  autonomous blue-collar occupations. On the one hand, drivers  must adhere rigorously to minute-by-minute schedules keyed  to a fixed route that must be followed exactly, and deviance  from these schedules has a high probability of discovery. On  the other hand, within the constraints of time and route, the  bus driver is like a ruler of a minor kingdom. Whether intended  by the organization or not, a great deal of the driver's behavior,  with respect to passenger relations, is discretionary.  For the passengers, the driver is the organization. The network  of drivers that the organization puts out on the road constitutes  the organization's public face. Ultimately, public attitudes  toward the organization, and public utilization and support of the  transit operation, may come to depend in large part on how well  the drivers represent the organization to the public. Thus, as a  true boundary-role person (Adams, 1976), the bus driver may be  in a unique position to influence organizational outcomes, by her  or his job-relevant behaviors. If these behaviors are, in any way,  a function of organizational commitment, then organizational  commitment and organizational performance might be related.  Measures  Organizational commitment. Employee commitment was  measured by the 15-item Organizational Commitment Ques-  tionnaire (OCQ) (Porter et al., 1974), which has demonstrated  good psychometric properties and has been used with a wide  range of job categories (Mowday, Steers, and Porter, 1979). In  the present study, Cronbach's alpha was .90. Two subscales  were also created, based on the results of a factor analysis:  value commitment (alpha=.89) and commitment to stay (al-  pha=.72), which appear to differentiate between the respon-  dents' commitment to support thegoals of the organization and  their commitment to retain their organizational membership.  Table 1 indicates the factor loadings and shows which items  were included in each of the subscales. As Table 1 indicates,  there was also a third factor extracted under the conventional  rule that eigenvalues equal or exceed a value of one (Nunnally,  1978); however, only one item had its highest loading on that  factor. Because single-item scales are notoriously unreliable,  only the two subscales mentioned were used.  In order to assess the stability of the factor structure obtained,  cross validation was achieved by randomly dividing the sample  and conducting a new pair of factor analyses. The factor-loading  patterns for these analyses were virtually identical with those  for the overall sample; thus, the factor structure appears quite  stable.  The observation that the items loading on factor 2 were all  reverse-scored, while none of the reverse-scored items were  loaded on factor 1, gave rise, initially, to the concern that the  structure obtained might have resulted from an artifact of  measurement. Although it is likely that such an artifact might  have contributed to the separation of factors, the two clusters  of questionnaire items appear to be conceptually distinct.  The value commitment scale includes items connoting pride in  association with the organization (i.e., identification), willing-  Organizational Commitment and Effectiveness  Table 1  Rotated Factor Loadings from Factor Analysis for the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire*  I am willing to put in a great deal of effort beyond that normally  expected in order to help thls organization be successful.

Although three of the nine items relate to  attitudes toward organizational membership, their wording  tends to imply that attachment is based on the member's  positive regard for the organization. In the aggregate, these  items indicate a form of organizational involvement, which  Etzioni (1 975) termed "moral"  and which is clearlyanalogous to  Stebbins' (1970b) notion of value commitment.  The commitment to stay scale includes a cluster of question-  naire items that pertain to membership in itself. Unlike the  membership-related items that load on factor 1, these items do  not connote an affective bond to the organization. On the  contrary, the wording of this set of items conveys a general  impression of Etzioni's (1 975) "calculative  involvement."  Organizational effectiveness. Several aspects of overall or-  ganizational effectiveness were tapped by the use of selected  performance indicators. The rationale for the selection of the  specific indicators is discussed in an earlier paper (Perry and  Angle, 1980b).  Employee turnover (separation rate) was measured by compila-  tion of statistics on voluntary termination during the preceding  fiscal year. A second turnover measure was obtained by self-  report of employees' intent to quit (Appendix), a measure which  has received substantial research support, as documented in a  recent review by Muchinsky and Tuttle (1979).  Employee tardiness was computed as the ratio of recorded  tardiness incidents to the mean number of employees during  the preceding fiscal year. Unfortunately, adequate tardiness  records had been maintained by only 14 of the 24 organizations  for which other performance data were available.  Absenteeism was obtained by self-report (Appendix). Like  tardiness, reliable absence statistics had not been maintained  by several of the participating organizations, but the alternative  measure was available through the employee questionnaire.  Operating expense was another measure of effectiveness. A  general notion of efficiency seems to be common in most  taxonomies of the dimensions of organizational effectiveness.  The broad concept of efficiency involves the computation of  ratios of inputs to outputs, or of costs to benefits. In public mass  transit, efficiency may be defined in terms of the extent to  which the organization is able to minimize operating costs,  relative both to the amount of transit service provided and to the  overall scope of the operation. Two performance indicators  were, therefore, selected for this purpose: operating expense  per revenue vehicle-hour, computed by dividing total operating  expenses for the preceding fiscal year by the total number of  operating hours for the revenue vehicles, and operating ex-  pense per employee, using the total number of employees as  the measure of input.  Organizational adaptability was measured by self-report, using a  modified version of Mott's (1 972) questionnaire. A four-item  scale was constructed and incorporated in both the employee  questionnaire and the transit manager questionnaire (Appen-  dix). The adaptability of each organization was thus measured  two ways, i.e., by averaging the responses to the adaptability  scale separately for transit managers and for other employees.  Procedures for Data Collection  Archival data and questionnaires. Archival data were col-  lected and questionnaires administered during two-day site  visits. Employees had been made aware of the survey in  advance of each visit throug h the internal communication  systems of the organizations. All questionnaires were pre-  sented directly to participating employees by a member of the  research team. In most cases, completed questionnaires,  which were filled out anonymously, were returned directly to  one of the researchers before the conclusion of the sitevisit. In  a few cases, respondents were unable to complete question-  naires in time, and so were furnished with preaddressed,  postpaid envelopes for direct mail return to the university. In no  case did persons in the chain of authority in the organization  become involved in administering questionnaires. The re-  sponse rate for the primary method of administration (i.e.,  on-site return) was 71 percent; however, the overall response  rate dropped to 64 percent when persons who were provided  mail-return envelopes were included in the computation. The  response rate from mail returns alone was 32 percent.  Sampling goals were established separately for each site, in  inverse proportion to organization size. At the smallest organiza-  tions, less than 30 eligible employees, for instance, the target  Organizational Commitment and Effectiveness  was 100 percent. At organizations  having more than 1,000  eligible employees, the target was only 10 percent. In most  cases, the targeted sampling objectives were achieved, the  exceptions tending to be in those organizations for which the  target was 100 percent sampling.  Since participation was voluntary, true random sampling was  not possible. Researchers attempted judgmentally,  however,  to distribute questionnaires across categories of race and sex,  and across the apparent range of age and tenure. Analysis of  questionnaire returns, however, disclosed some discrepancies  in proportional representation of certain groups. Blacks were  underrepresented (14 percent in sample, 31 percent in popula-  tion); as were employees having more than five years' tenure in  the organization (30 percent in sample, 38 percent in popula-  tion); women were overrepresented (18 percent in sample, 6  percent in population). Other groups matched sampling targets  reasonably well. Retrospectively, it appeared that the devia-  tions from ideal proportional representation may have resulted,  at least in part, from population differences during the work  shifts in which most of the sampling effort had been concen-  trated.  RESULTS  Organizational Commitment: Subgroup Differences  Personal factors accounted for several subgroup differences.  Commitment was positively correlated with age (r=.17,  p <.001),  but negatively related to educational level (p<.0001).  The results for educational level were striking, showing a  steady decline in commitment across eight ascending educa-  tional level categories. No significant differences were found,  however, across racial-ethnic subgroups or between em-  ployees whose income was or was not the primary source of  family support.  The relationships of age and of educational level with commit-  ment were generally consistent with findings from related  research (Sheldon, 1971 ; Hrebiniak and Alutto,  1972; Steers.  1977a; Stevens, Beyer, and Trice, 1978). The argument often  used to explain these relationships is that increasing age and  decreasing levels of education tend to reduce the feasibility of  obtaining desirable alternative education and therefore tend to  restrict the individual to the present organization.  Females were more strongly committed to their organizations  than males (p<.001). While this finding was consistent with  research that has treated commitment as an instrumental  attachment to organizational membership (Hrebiniak and  Alutto,  1972), it had not been expected in the present study,  since the OCQ appears to tap a form of commitment that is  conceptually very close to work involvement (Dubin, Cham-  poux, and Porter, 1975) and, historically, women have been less  involved than men in their work (Department of Health, Educa-  tion, and Welfare, 1973; Taveggia and Ziemba,  1978). The  rationale usually presented for such findings is that females  enjoy less interorganizational mobility than males and, there-  fore, tend to become restricted to their present organizations. In  the present research, demographic differences alone would  have predicted higher commitment for males. Male employees  were older and had longer organizational tenure than females.  There were no significant sex differences in educational levels.  Measures of Organizational Effectiveness  Correlational analysis was the principal method used to assess  organizational-level relationships. Pearson correlation coeffi-  cients were computed where marginal distributions were  symmetrical and unimodal; however, forvariables with skewed  distributions, nonparametric correlations were substituted for  Pearson correlations. lntercorrelations among the effective-  ness indicators are provided in Table 2 . All variables in Table 2  were measured at the organizational level; thus, the self-report  measures consisted of the arithmetic mean of responses to  questionnaires within each participating organization.

First, the correlation between managers' and  employees' organizational adaptability ratings was rather low  (r=.23); thus, these two member groups appeared to percelve  the same organization somewhat differently. Second, the two  measures of turnover (separation rate, intent to quit) were  negatively correlated with absenteeism, although neither coef-  ficient was statistically significant. This is in keeping with March  and Simon's (1 958)view of participation, that is, that there is no  consistent relationship between absenteeism and voluntary  turnover.  Employee Commitment and Organizational Effectiveness  Employees' organizational commitment scores, both for overall  commitment and the two commitment subscales, were aggre-  gated in the same way as the performance indicators. Table 3  shows the correlations between the effectiveness indicators  and overall commitment, value commitment, and commitment  to stay. Table 3 also shows the absolute differences between  the correlations with value commitment and commitment to  stay, for each performance indicator. The statistical signifi-  cance of the difference between correlations was computed  using a technique recommended by Steiger (1 980) for testing  the equality of two correlations having one index in common.  This procedure, which utilizes the Fisherr-to-z transformation,  is superior to Hotelling's t test, where sample sizes are small.

In order to avoid the inherent single-source bias, an  alternative technique was used for the correlations between  these three indicators and the commitment measures. The  sample of respondents was randomly divided so that, for each  organization, the measures of employee-perceived adaptability,  absenteeism, and intent to quit were obtained from half of the  employees, while organizational levels of overall commitment,  value commitment, and commitment to stay were obtained by  taking the arithmetic means for t.he remaining half of the  employees. Since the other performance measures were free  of single-source bias, they were all correlated with commit-  ment scores that were based on the entire employee sample.  Organizational commitment was significantly  related to organi-  zational adaptability, based on employee questionnaire data, but  was not significantly related based on manager questionnaires.  This disparity was consistent with the low correlation between  the two adaptability measures (Table 2).  Turnover, that is, separation rate and intent to quit, was  significantly  related to organizational commitment, as was the  archival measure of tardiness rate. However, neither absen-  teeism nor the two operating-expense ratios showed a statisti-  cally significant association with commitment.  When the two commitment subscales, value commitment and  commitment to stay, were substituted for the 15-item measure  of organizational commitment, turnover appeared to be more  strongly associated with commitment to stay than with value  commitment. This difference was statistically significant for  the intent-to-quit measure (p<.05). The archival separation rate  indicator showed a similar directional pattern;  however, the  difference fell short of the traditional level of statistical signifi-  cance (p<.07). Tardiness rate was negatively correlated with  value commitment, as had been the case with organizational  commitment, but was not significantly correlated with com-  mitment to stay;  however, the difference between the two  correlation coefficients was not statistically significant (p >.20).  Other indicators tended to show stronger associations with  value commitment than with commitment to stay, among them  the two operating expense ratios. However, even though the  difference between the correlations for both ratios was statisti-  cally significant, the correlations fell short of traditional levels of  significance (p<.08,  for both  correlation^).^  Neither organiza-  tional adaptability nor absenteeism showed a differential  strength of association with the two commitment subscales. In  summary, although the overall pattern in Table 3 tends to  suggest that the two subscales relate differentially to turnover  and to such other types of measuresas operating expense, the  absence in some instances of statistically significant findings  dictates caution in drawing conclusions.  DISCUSSION  This research was designed to find systematic relationships  between members' commitment to their work organizations  and several indices of organizational effectiveness. The results  were rather mixed. The pattern of relations hips s hown in Table  3 for the two commitment subscales perhaps provides one clue  as to why the overall commitment-effectiveness relationships  were not as strong as had been anticipated. Although none of  the relationships was statistically significant, the two operating  expense ratios showed a tendency toward a stronger associa-  tion with value commitment than with commitment to stay,  whereas the turnover measures were more clearly related to  commitment to stay. This pattern suggests that any impact of  employee commitment on the organization may indeed depend  on the specific kinds of behaviors to which the employees are  committed and, of course, the effects of such behaviors on  organizational outcomes.  In keeping with earlier research (Porter et al., 1974; Steers,  1977a; Koch and Steers, 1978), the clearest evidence provided  by the present study is that there is an inverse relationship  between organizational commitment and employee turnover.  As Steers (1 977a) pointed out, such a finding is not surprising,  considering Porter's definition of commitment (Porter et al.,  1974). However, a strong desire to remain a member of one's  organization does not automatically imply that there is also an  intention to be a dependable and hardworking employee. In  terms of Harris and Eoyang's (1 977) typology, organizational  outcomes would probably vary, depending on which quadrant  includes the preponderance of employees whoare in a position  to influence the performance of the organization. For instance,  if most such employees had a strong intention to remain but  low motivation to contribute their best efforts toward the  mission (i.e., passive commitment), there would be no reason  to expect a simple, linear relationship between organizational  commitment and overall organizational effectiveness-particu-  larly in cases where turnover appears to have little direct impact  on other aspects of organizational performance. As Table 2  indicates, the turnover measures appeared virtually unrelated to  1  It is acknowledged that the significance of  the difference between two correlation  coefficients, neither of which is statistically  significant, is difficult to interpret. How-  ever, the fact that a correlation could have  occurred by chance does not mean that the  correlation equals zero. In this instance, the  larger of each pair of correlations related to  operating expense is nearly significant  (p<.081. Furthermore, the test forthe  equallty of two dependent correlations  takes intoaccount, simultaneously, the size  of each correlation and the degrees of  freedom. Accordingly, there appears to be  some justtfication  for reporting statistical  significance, when found. On the other  hand, the issue is controversial, and the  data are offered with due caution.  Organizational Commitment and Effectiveness  operating costs, and the probable reasons for this have been  discussed in an earlier paper (Perry and Angle, 1980a).  The overall pattern in Table 3 seems consistent with Harris and  Eoyang's (1977) notion that commitment to stay and commit-  ment to work are Independent constructs and, in combination,  have complex implications for organlzatlons. However, the  table shows fewer statistically significant relationships than  might be desired, and there are some anomalies. For instance,  although there is no significant difference between the correla-  tions for employee-perceived adaptability and the two com-  mitment subscales, the trend IS in a counterintuitive direction.  Indeed, the largest correlation in Table 3 is between  employee-perceived adaptability and commitment to stay.  It would seem unlikely that a linear relationship should exist  betweenany form of commitment and organizational adaptabil-  ity. At the extreme, commitment would appear to milltate  against the individual's (and therefore the organization's) ability  to adapt to change (Salancik, 1977). It is more likely that, with  respect to adaptability, there is some optimal level of commit-  ment -sufficient to evoke needed employee behaviors be-  yond expliclt role stipulations, but not so strong as to incur the  suspension of individual judgment In favor of organizational  precepts  As an additional note on the number of nonsignificant relation-  ships in Table 3, it should be recognized that this study  represents an attempt to find systematic relationships in a  "noisy  system." As is often the case with field research, there  are a number of uncontrolled variables. In particular, such  performance measures as operating expense ratios are subject  to many influences besides the motivation of lower-level  employees. Management competence, structural and  technological variables, and various contextual factors combine  to place limits on any potential effort-performance relationship.  Two cautions are required. The first is about the cross-sectional  nature of the research. To the extent that Table 3 does show  relationships between commitment and indicators of organiza-  tional effectiveness, the directionality of the causal arrow has  still not been established. For example, however logical a case  might be made that some optimal level of employee commit-  ment might foster organizational adaptability, there is the  possibility that organizations that are adaptable either induce  commitment in their members or tend to attract and retain a  disproportionate share of committed types of employees.  The second caution is about occupational specificity. As Salan-  cik (1 977) pointed out, the impact of employee commitment on  an organization depends, not only on what the employees are  committed to do, but also on what the potential is for those  specific behaviors to influence organizational outcomes. In the  present research, for example, commitment to stay was shown  to have a more clear-cut relationship to voluntary turnover than  to such indicators as operating costs. This may reflect the ready  availability of a replacement labor pool and relatively modest  training costs in the transit industry. In an industry where  labor-pool and technological considerations would combine to  make turnover particularly expensive, commitment to stay  might exert a more powerful impact on operating costs, though  indirectly.  CONCLUSION  The present research offered an opportunity to uncover a  commitment-performance relationship, if such a relationship  exists, through cross-organizational comparison of commit-  ment levels relative to performance measures within a single  type of service organization. Furthermore, there were reasons  to expect that the role of bus operator was such that a  behavior-performance link might, indeed, exist.  What the research most clearly accomplished was a construc-  tive replication of a relatively large body of earlier work, showing  a definite negative relationship between organizational com-  mitment and voluntary turnover. Beyond that issue, the results  were rather mixed. The statistics that could most nearly be  considered bottom-line indicators fort he organizations that  participated in the research were the two operating expense  ratios, yet these aspects of organizational performance were  not significantly associated with organizational commitment.  Although employee-perceived organizational adaptability was  associated with commitment, manager-perceived adaptability  was not. The relationship between tardiness and commitment  was significant;  however, employee tardiness rate was not  significantly associated with organizational operating costs.  The overall pattern of relationships between various perform-  ance indicators and the two commitment subscales, though  inconclusive, suggests follow-up research. The relationship  between commitment and behavior very likely depends on the  form that commitment takes. Ratherthan assuming a simplistic  relationship between commitment and positive performance  outcomes, organizational researchers will have to begin to deal  with more complex factors.
