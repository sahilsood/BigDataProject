In particular, by examining the issue of causal order, it addresses a significant  gap  in  the  extant  HRM–performance  literature  within  the  context  of  such  firms.  Significant  simultaneous  and  longitudinal  relationships  between  HRM  practices  and  specific  performance  indicators  are  found.  Controlling  for  past  performance  and  thus,  testing  for  the  potential  for  reverse  causality  does  not  eliminate  the  significant  relationship  between  human  resource  practices and performance. In sum, the use of human resource practices is found to positively  enhance  sustained  competitive  advantage.  By  explicitly  examining  the  issue  of  causality  in  the  human resources –performance relationship, this article makes a contribution to both the human  resource and SME literatures. Keywords causal order, human resource management (HRM), performance, small- and medium-sized enter- prises (SMEs) Introduction Given contemporary financial market constraints and limited growth in demand, smaller firms are  focusing increasingly on how to utilise existing resources more efficiently and effectively (Gallego  et al., 2012). Given their resource limitations, small and medium-sized firms have fewer options  than their larger counterparts to improve performance. However, one resource that is common to  all organisations, which has been the focus of increasing theoretical, empirical and practical atten- tion  in  small  and  medium  sized  enterprises  (SMEs),  is  that  of  human  resources.  Scholars  have  suggested that adopting specific human resource management (HRM) practices can improve small  firm performance and sustain competitiveness (e.g. Michie and Sheehan, 2008; Patel and Cardon,  2010; Razouk, 2011; Williamson et al., 2002). In recent years there has been a growing literature  Corresponding author: Maura Sheehan, Brighton Business School, University of Brighton, Mithras House, Lewes Road, Brighton, Sussex BN2 4AT,  UK.

The most comprehensive account of HRM practices used in SMEs in  the  UK  is  based  on  the  analysis  of  the  2004  Workplace  Employment  Relations  Survey,  which  found formal human resource practices to be in common usage with a higher incidence than previ- ously assumed (see Forth et al., 2006). Among practitioners there is also recognition that the somewhat commonly held view of the  past, that smaller firms ‘do not need human resource’ and/or the view that human resource prac- tices are ‘informal’, is no longer applicable. In Personnel Today, Stephanie Sparrow (2006) empha- sised that SMEs ‘have shaken off their image of short-termism and amateurish people policies’. In  response, Paul Sparrow, currently Director of the Centre for Performance-led Human Resources,  University of Lancaster, commented that: Overall they [SMEs] are more advanced in people management than many believe ... Techniques such as  culture-change  programmes,  employee-involvement  schemes,  team-working  and  devolved  control  systems are all evident. (Sparrow, 2006) In  the  context  of  the  European  Union  (EU),  the  dynamic  between  informal  and  formal  human  resource practices has been significantly influenced by the broader legal and regulatory context in  which  firms  operate.  European  employment  directives  have  contributed  to  more  formal  human  resource practices; in the context of the UK, an increase in the regulation of labour under succes- sive Labour administrations (1994–2010) is likely also to have influenced the formality of human  resources.1 Therefore, it is argued throughout this article that the external context has influenced  the use of formal human resource practices significantly. However, what has not been established is whether the use of a greater number of formal human  resource practices has performance benefits for SMEs, similar to that found in numerous empirical  studies of large firms (Guest, 2011). While there have been several empirical studies that examine  the relationship between the use of formal HRM practices and performance, including entrepre- neurial orientation and innovation, in SMEs (e.g. Messersmith and Wales, 2011) the relationship  between HRM practices and the performance of SMEs remains under-researched (for exceptions  see Messersmith and Guthrie, 2010; Razouk, 2011; Verreynne et al., 2011). This is likely to reflect,  at least in part, the methodological challenges that have been identified in the analysis of HRM and  performance in large firms (see Guest, 2011). A significant limitation of the extant literature is a  lack  of  methodological  rigour  to  demonstrate  that  the  positive  relationship  commonly  found  between human resources and performance is actually causal, in the sense that when formal human  resource practices are instituted, they lead to higher performance (Wright et al., 2005). It is for this  reason that the design of this study directly responds to Wright et al.’s call that: Future research should focus on study designs that are better able to demonstrate causal order to show that  human resource practices, when implemented correctly, can positively generate higher firm performance.  At a minimum, this calls for focusing on gathering data at multiple points in time. (2005: 435) In order to address this pivotal issue of causality, a sample of 336 UK SMEs were surveyed on the  use of a selection of formal human resource practices which were applicable to 90 percent or more  of their employees in two time periods, 2007 and 2011. In addition, subjective measures of perfor- mance were obtained for these two time periods for this sample. Specifically, placed within the theoretical framework of the resource-based view (RBV) of the  firm, this article examines whether there is a relationship between the use of a selection of formal  human  resource  practices  and  the  performance  of  SMEs  and  explores  the  causal  order  of  any  Sheehan  547 relationship found. The performance of firms is studied through profitability, innovation and labour  turnover. By analysing whether the selected human resource practices assessed at one point in time  are related to subsequent SME performance – and thereby providing a rare ‘predictive’ method –  the article makes an important contribution to both the SME and HRM literatures, and the emerg- ing discourse between these two literatures and fields of practice. The article is structured as follows. The first section provides an overview of the relevant litera- tures. The research hypotheses are then formulated. Subsequently, the sample, measures and esti- mation  methods  are  discussed.  The  results  are  then  presented.  The  article  concludes  with  the  implications of the study’s findings for practice, reflection upon the limitations of the study, which  are linked to opportunities for future research, and final remarks. Literature review and hypotheses The resource-based view of the firm In order for firms to sustain competitive advantage, they must acquire and utilise valuable, scarce  and inimitable resources (Barney, 1991). RBV emphasises the internal characteristics of the firm:  in particular, its ability to develop distinct resources and capabilities which are difficult to imitate  and substitute, and so will enhance its ability to adapt to a continuously and rapidly changing envi- ronment.  In  contrast  with  other  resources  that  are  easier  to  imitate,  the  management  of  human  resources is complex, ambiguous and dynamic, and thus a potential source of significant competi- tive advantage (Barney and Wright, 1998; Becker and Huselid, 1998). Moreover, the inimitability  of HRM practices is linked to path dependency (Collis and Montgomery, 1995), which introduces  a dynamic and temporal dimension into an analysis of HRM within an RBV framework. The unique historical conditions within each firm make it difficult for competitors to obtain the  same level and quality of human capital (where human capital refers to the knowledge, skills and  abilities embedded within a firm’s human resources that are the direct result of learning, education  and  training;  Becker,  1964),  or  to  replicate  the  same  human  resource  practices  and  systems.  Temporally, even when competitors realise that human resource systems produce value, they can- not  replicate  them  immediately,  especially  in  the  resource  constrained  environments  common  within SMEs (Becker and Gerhart, 1996; Dierickx and Cool, 1989; Razouk, 2011). Unsurprisingly, human resources is regarded as a pivotal input to the resource base of the firm  (Barney and Wright, 1998; Becker and Huselid, 1998; Huselid, 1995; Wright et al., 2001). However,  debate continues over how the management of human resources contributes to sustained competi- tive advantage. It has been suggested that the source of competitive advantage lies primarily in the  human resources themselves, and not in the practices used to recruit, utilise or retain them (Ferligoj  et al., 1997). In contrast, others argue that HRM practices themselves can be viewed as organisa- tional competencies, especially their ability to influence employee behaviours: for example, the  ability  to  motivate  and  generate  loyalty  (Barney,  1997;  Narasimha,  2000;  Oinas  and Van  Gils,  2001). Either interpretation suggests that human resources are important contributors to the suc- cess of the firm, and that the use of a greater number of human resource practices is likely to be  associated with better firm performance. The RBV framework implies that human resources may be of even greater significance for  smaller firms, since they often have to do more with fewer resources in order to remain competi- tive. In addition, the effect of HRM decisions is likely to differ in such firms compared to larger  organisations, as each policy and decision regarding human resources is likely to be amplified.  Issues of person–organisation fit become particularly important, as new employees need to adopt  shared  team  mental  models  (Heneman  et  al.,  2000),  often  requiring  team  members  to  play  548    International Small Business Journal 32(5) multiple roles in the organisation; present a consistent face to customers and other stakeholders;  and  display  extra-role  behaviours,  including  a  high  degree  of  flexibility  (Messersmith  and  Guthrie, 2010). Moreover, the management of human resources is likely to be administered very  differently in smaller firms than larger firms. Often, the responsibility will fall on the organisa- tion’s executives and individual managers. This has the potential to lead to greater vertical inte- gration  between  firm  strategy  and  human  resource  practices.  However,  it  may  result  in  the  neglect or mismanagement of this important resource, arising from the fact that entrepreneurs  and small business owners have so many competing demands for their time and may lack experi- ence in employee management. Indeed, given that often, employment practices have been found  to be low on the priority list of smaller firms (Cassell et al., 2002), it is important to establish  whether a more formal approach to managing human resources – through the use of a greater  number of formal human resources practices – affects the performance of such firms. Certainly,  evidence from large firms suggests that a link between the use of more human resource practices  and organisational performance is a positive one (Guest, 2011). It is also important to emphasise that in the smaller firm context, whether human resource prac- tices are ‘formal’ or ‘informal’ should be carefully considered. As such, the demarcation between  formality and informality should not be viewed as strictly dichotomous, but rather as a continuum  (see Ram and Edwards, 2003). Formality and informality is likely to be dynamic, reflecting both  internal and external contingency factors. This view is echoed by Ram et al.: The nature of ‘informality’ in small firms should not, therefore, be taken at face value. Too often it is  accepted as an inevitable product of entrepreneurism and close interpersonal relations in the workplace,  promoting individualised and ad hoc patterns of decision-making and behaviour ... There is real scope for  management  choice,  but  within  certain  limits  and  as  circumstances  change  the  nature  and  extent  of  informality adapts. (2001: 859) Moreover, in the context of the UK and the EU generally, the regulatory environment is likely  to have had a significant influence on SME’ use of formal human resource practices. In the UK,  the external environment changed considerably in relation to the regulation of the labour mar- ket during the 13 years of Labour governments. For example, the number of cases accepted to  proceed  to  employment  tribunals  increased  significantly,  even  during  the  time  span  of  this  study,  by  43  percent  (266,500  in  2008–2009  to  382,400  in  2010–2011;  Ministry  of  Justice,  2011). It is within this type of environment that UK SMEs operated during the two survey peri- ods, and it is argued that this fundamentally affected the use of more formal human resource  practices. This  issue  is  returned  to  again  in  the  discussion  of  the  selection  of  formal  human  resource practices. Human resource management and performance Early research on the HRM–performance relationship suggested that the adoption of ‘best prac- tice’ human resources may have a universal positive effect on the performance of firms. A set  of  best  practice  was  sought,  which  could  be  applied  more  or  less  universally  across  firms  (Delaney and Huselid, 1996; Delery and Doty, 1996). In effect, this analysis implied that the  positive effects of different best practices were additive: that the more such practices are used,  the better the performance (Becker and Gerhart, 1996). The terminology used in this early literature  has  evolved  subsequently  to  encompass  the  broad  term  ‘high-performance  work  systems’:  often a term that is used without a clear explanation of what practices comprise such systems  Sheehan  549 (e.g. Razouk, 2011). Nevertheless, there is a general emphasis in the human resources–performance  literature  on  analysing  ‘high  performance’  or  ‘high  commitment’,  as  opposed  to  traditional  practices (Guest and Conway, 2011). In contrast, the contingency approach posits that the rela- tionship between performance and HRM is conditional upon the different modalities taken by  another variable, viewed as contingent. The strategy pursued by an organisation is considered  to  be  a  pivotal  contingency  factor  (Delery  and  Doty,  1996;  Youndt  et  al.,  1996). A  further  approach, the configurational, combines the best practice or universal and contingent approaches  to the HRM–performance relationship, and examines how a range of independent variables are  related to performance (the dependent variable). In particular, this approach allows scope for  external or vertical fit between HRM practices and business strategy, but also for internal fit or  horizontal fit between practices. Research on HRM in SMEs has been evolving in the past decade: a focus upon the HRM– performance debate in the context of SMEs is emerging but such investigations are challenging,  given the high incidence of informal HRM (see for example, Cardon and Stevens, 2004), and the  coexistence  of  formal  and  informal  HRM  practices  (Martin  et  al.,  2008).  In  order  to  establish  whether there is a relationship between human resource practices and performance, especially in  any type of large survey, researchers must ask respondents whether a particular policy is in place.  In the context of SMEs, questions are prefaced generally with whether the policy is ‘formal’ and/ or ‘written’ (Michie and Sheehan, 2008; Nguyen and Bryant, 2004). However, this approach is  unlikely to capture the important role of informal HRM in SMEs. A further issue complicating analyses of the HRM–performance relationship is the potential for  the difference between rhetoric and reality regarding policy presence and implementation (Legge,  2005). Specifically, a human resource practice may formally be in place, but it may be delivered  only sparingly, especially when delivery has been devolved to line managers and/or is not consis- tently applied to all employees (Legge, 2005; Bowen and Ostroff, 2004; Guest and Conway, 2011).  In the small firm context, given the importance of informal practices, any survey about whether a  formal practice is in place or not has the potential to underestimate, and possibly misrepresent, the  extent to which human resources are managed in practice, since the use and effectiveness of infor- mal management will not be captured in a survey. In terms of the actual management of human resources, Marlow (2002) found that respon- dents often had formal written policies – in filing cabinets, utilised when problems arose – but  that owners preferred to maintain their own idiosyncratic approaches to managing the employ- ment  relationship,  and  rarely  consulted  or  used  formal  procedures.  Similarly,  Marlow  and  Thompson found that formal policies were in place for key employment issues, but report that  ‘there were clear differences apparent in the manner and extent to which these policies were  embedded into practice’ (2008: 238). These studies suggest that great care must be given to the  interpretation of findings about formal human resource practices in the SME context. Moreover,  quantitative studies of labour management in smaller firms (Bacon et al., 1996; Gilman et al.,  2002; Marlow, 2002) have found a degree of ‘over-claiming’ and ‘mock formality’ in the use of  formal policy and practice, thereby providing another potential source of overestimating the  extent of formal human resources in SMEs (see Marlow and Thompson, 2008 for a detailed  discussion). Thus, caveats must be used when interpreting any findings about the relationship  between formal human resource practices and performance in SMEs, especially when the data  have been generated by surveys, as the potential exists for both overestimation and underesti- mation of the role of human resources in SMEs. In terms of the extant literature on the human resources–performance relationship in SMEs, the  impact of training and performance has been investigated most frequently, and generally a positive  550    International Small Business Journal 32(5) association with performance is found (de Kok, 2002; Patton and Marlow, 2002; Storey, 2004;  Storey and Westhead, 1997). Nguyen and Bryant (2004) found a positive relationship between the  use of formal human resource practices and firm size; moreover, formal human resource practice  is positively associated with the owner’s perception of firm performance. More recently, and draw- ing upon RBV in independently owned firms less than 10 years old and with more than 10 employ- ees,  Messersmith  and  Guthrie  (2010)  found  that  utilising  high-performance  work  systems  was  positively associated with sales growth and innovation. Patel and Cardon (2010) examined the role  of adopting HRM practices on labour productivity in SMEs that face high levels of product–market  competition. They found that group culture strengthens a firm’s propensity to adopt HRM practices  and increases the effect of HRM practices on labour productivity; however, in firms where there  was minimal product–market competition, limited benefit was derived from the adoption of human  resource practices. Perhaps of even greater importance, they found that when SMEs were faced  with high levels of product–market competition – absent group culture – they were not likely to  adopt many HRM practices, neither was adopting such practices found to enhance labour produc- tivity significantly. This study demonstrates the importance of contingency – internal, in relation to  group culture, and external, in relation to product market competition – in the analysis of HRM and  performance in SMEs. In a sample of 119 young high-technology firms, Messersmith and Wales (2011) found that the  relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and firm growth was not statistically significant.  However, combining high-performance work systems or a partnership philosophy with entrepre- neurial orientation was positively associated with higher levels of growth. This study also high- lighted  the  importance  of  contingency  –  here,  internal  contingency  –  in  that  the  potential  for  entrepreneurial orientation to enhance growth in young firms depends on the extent to which these  organisations utilise certain human resource practices. Utilising a multi-respondent approach of interviews with chief executive officers (CEOs) and  employees, Verreynne et al. (2011) found a positive association between better performance and  high-performance work systems: trust, teamwork, participation, organisational learning orientation  and employee skill development, performance systems and high commitment were of particular  importance.  From  the  employees’  perspective,  the  link  between  better  performance  and  high-  performance work systems was particularly acute for engagement, participation and organisational  support.  Informality  was  a  common  thread  which,  the  authors  found,  facilitated  the  interaction  between employees and high-performance work systems – especially employee participation – and  contributed to a positive organisational culture, which in turn enhanced performance. These impor- tant findings, particularly in relation to the role of informality, reflects the advantage of their study’s  methodology  (multi-respondent  case  studies),  which  contrasts  with  the  more  common  single- respondent survey-type method commonly used in these recent articles. Based on the RBV of the firm and the considerable empirical evidence outlined, the present  study’s first hypothesis, set within a cross-sectional context, is as follows: H1:   There will be a positive association between the number of selected formal human resource practices  (at time 1) and reported firm performance (at time 1). A significant limitation of the empirical evidence to date on the relationship between HRM and  performance, including within SMEs, is that the studies are cross-sectional, and therefore do not  allow inferences about causality to be drawn. It is to this pivotal issue that this article now turns.2 Sheehan  551 Causal order between human resource management practices and firm  performance A  better  understanding  of  the  interaction  between  HRM  and  performance  and  particularly,  the  search for conclusive evidence of the decisive impact of the former on the latter, has been referred  to as the human resources’ ‘Holy Grail’ (Boselie et al., 2005). An ability to establish causal order  in the HRM–performance relationship is a necessary, albeit insufficient, step in the development of  conclusive evidence about the relationship. While the extant research suggests a positive relation- ship between human resources and performance (see Boselie et al., 2005 and Combs et al., 2006  for comprehensive reviews), both of these reviews concluded that there was insufficient evidence  to  explain  why  there  was  an  association,  reflecting  to  a  large  extent  the  inability  of  previous  research to establish causal order. Indeed, as Wright et al. (2005) document, causality has received  insufficient attention in the prior literature. In order to establish causal order, the design of the  research must be ‘predictive’, rather than ‘post-predictive’ (the most prevalent design within the  literature), ‘retrospective’ or ‘contemporaneous’ (for a detailed discussion, see Wright et al., 2005). A predictive study requires collection of data in at least two time periods, and thereby must be  longitudinal rather than cross-sectional in design. Utilising a rare predictive approach and explic- itly testing for causal order, Guest et al. (2003) related human resource practices to both past and  subsequent objective productivity and profitability data, as well as current subjective productivity  and financial performance estimates among a sample of 366 companies in the UK. They found a  positive association between HRM and performance, but significantly, the study failed to demon- strate  that  human  resource  causes  higher  performance.  Wright  et  al.’s  (2005)  predictive  study,  which also tested for causal order, found a drastic reduction to non-significance of the effects on  human resource on performance, once past performance had been controlled for, thereby echoing  Guest et al.’s (2003) findings. Given the scarcity of resources in most SMEs, which will affect their ability to invest in human  resources, it is essential that this causation issue is addressed in any analysis of human resources  and performance. The only study to date which has examined the issue of causal order in the  HRM–performance  relationship  (specifically,  a  predictive  study),  was  conducted  by  Razouk  (2011) on a sample of 275 French SMEs. Significant simultaneous (‘contemporaneous’) and lon- gitudinal correlations between high-performance work systems (the focus of the study) and all of  the performance indicators examined (profitability, innovation and social climate) were found,  Most importantly, in terms of the causal order debate, controlling for past performance did not  eliminate the correlation of high-performance work systems with future performance. The impli- cations of this study for SMEs are potentially quite profound: investing in formal human resource  and/or high-performance work systems was found to positively affect (contribute to) an increase  in performance. Thus, there appears to be a dichotomy in the literature regarding the analysis of causal order in  HRM–performance research, between large organisations and SMEs. The RBV of the firm pro- vides some insight into why this pattern has been found. The contrasting findings about causal  order may reflect more careful scrutiny about SMEs’ decisions to introduce formal human resource  practices, compared to larger organisations which have more resources. For large organisations it  would be standard to have formal practices, although they would not necessarily be linked with  efficiency (rather, practices may be in place for ‘legitimacy’ reasons; see Collings and Dick, 2011  for a recent discussion in the context of multinational corporations). In contrast, in SMEs, before a  formal practice is introduced, there are likely to be at least some implicit (if not explicit) calcula- tions about the possible returns associated with the implementation of formal practices. In addition,  552    International Small Business Journal 32(5) some investment in formal human resources may be driven by what SME owners view as poten- tially  ‘preventative  costs’  –  that  is,  practices  such  as  job  descriptions  and  formal  performance  management reviews – the presence of which may reduce the probability of employment tribunals  (see for example, Marlow and Thompson, 2008). The study’s remaining hypotheses are derived from the importance of conducting an intertem- poral  analysis  of  any  HRM–performance  relationship  found.  If  there  is  a  positive  association  between selected formal human resource practices in period 1 (H1), the returns to human resources  should continue to contribute to the firm’s performance in period 2, as the investment is effectively  amortised and returns realised. Therefore, the second hypothesis states: H2:   There will be a positive association between the number of selected formal human resource practices  (at time 1) and reported firm performance (at time 2). Given  the  importance  of  testing  for  causal  order  outlined  previously,  the  final  hypothesis  posits: H3:   The  positive  association  between  the  number  of  selected  formal  human  resource  practices  and  reported firm performance (at time 2) will be sustained after controlling for previous performance  (at time 1). If H3 is not rejected, this implies that human resource practices in an earlier period (time 1) posi- tively contribute to sustained competitive advantage in SMEs. Therefore, the testing of this hypoth- esis is important for both the HRM and SME literatures. Method Sample and data collection The data used in the analysis were derived from a random, stratified sample of firms from the Dun  and Bradstreet databases in the UK. Four dimensions were used to stratify the sample: organisa- tional size; age; the primary sector of business activity; and independent ownership (i.e. not being  part of another, usually larger, organisation). In relation to size, the selection criterion was that the  firms employ between 10 and 249 employees (consistent with the EU’s 2005 definition of SMEs).  For age, the selection criteria were that the firm was at least 18 months old, so that initial, often  idiosyncratic start-up issues were not captured. Statisticians at the then Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform assisted  with interfacing between the Dun & Bradstreet data and the Annual Business Inquiry survey, and  advised on the selection of industries based on their relative contribution to employment in SMEs  in the UK in the initial sample period (2007). Using the 1992 UK Standard Industrial Classification  (SIC) codes, in total nine industries – four in manufacturing and five in services –were included in  the analysis. Given that the firms employed fewer than 250 people, it was unlikely that they would have a  human resource department or human resource director or specialist, so letters and emails were  sent to the company’s CEO, owner or managing director – the most senior person that could be  identified from the Dun & Bradstreet database. Contact details were checked by a Google search,  as the information there was often found to be more current than that in the Dun & Bradstreet  databases. Due to low responses to postal surveys, in particular for SMEs (Dennis, 2003), tele- phone  surveys  were  conducted  with  the  selected  companies.  A  professional  survey  company,  Sheehan  553 working in close collaboration with the primary researcher, conducted the structured interviews,  which  lasted  approximately  30  minutes,  in  both  time  periods.  Confidentiality  was  emphasised  exhaustively. The 2007 surveys were piloted first by the primary researcher through personal con- tacts with 10 SME owners, and then by the survey company (six additional firms). This informa- tion, which was used to refine the survey instrument, was particularly important in relation to the  selection of formal human resource practices utilised in the final survey (see below for further  detail and Appendix 1 for additional details pertaining to the telephone interviews). Study response rates Response rates are as follows (see Table 1): 26.5 percent in 2007 and 24.7 percent in 2011. Owing to  the difficulty in obtaining panel data, a high target response rate of 25 percent was set in both periods.  Participants in the 2007 survey were asked if they would agree to be re-surveyed at a future date, and  these participants were prioritised in the 2011 survey.3 All participants in both periods were sent an  executive summary of the findings, including industry or sector-specific recommendations, which  they  found  very  helpful  and  contributed  to  their  willingness  to  participate  in  the  2011  survey.  Moreover, participants in both periods were offered 20-minute ‘telephone surgeries’ at no cost, con- ducted by the primary researcher and her team, to discuss the study’s findings and in particular rec- ommendations  on  how  to  improve  the  management  of  human  resources  within  their  firms  (see  Appendix 1 for additional detail). These methods also helped to increase repeat participation in period  2 (2011). A total of 336 firms participated in both surveys (21.1% of the 1589 firms that participated  in the 2007 survey). In 78.3 percent (263) of firms, the same person completed the survey in both time  periods. It is this longitudinal data that are analysed in this article. Utilising the Dun & Bradstreet database, response bias was assessed by examining differences  in net sales, employee levels and firm age between responding and non-responding firms in 2007  and 2011, and between firms where the respondent had changed over the two periods. A two-stage  Heckman Test was used to test for response bias, including comparing these measures in the firms  where the survey was not completed by the same respondent in both time periods. The only statisti- cally significant response bias found was for firms that employed fewer than 25 people: these were  statistically significantly less likely to participate in either survey at the 0.05 percent level. Measures Human resource practices. In order to place this study in the broader human resource–performance  literature, the selected practices are ones that are commonly included in the extant literature, par- ticularly that which examines high-performance work systems.4 Moreover, in order to examine  whether  the  well-evidenced  positive  relationship  between  human  resources  and  performance  is  found  in  the  SME  context,  focus  is  given  to  formal  human  resource  practices,  and  thereby  the  potentially significant role of informal practices could not be captured.5 The selection of practices covered six main areas of HRM (see Appendix 2, Table 7 for detail): 1.  recruitment and selection; 2.  performance appraisal; 3.  performance-based compensation pay; 4.  training and development; 5.  employee voice, consultation, participation and information sharing; 6.  strategic people management. 554    International Small Business Journal 32(5) Table 1.  Samples and study response rates. 2007 survey (1) 2011 survey (2) Panel, 2007 and 2011 (3) Sample Response (n) Response rate (%) 5998 1589 26.5% 6165 1522 24.7% – 336   21.1% (out of 1589) The selected practices were modified based on the pilot interviews to reflect, in part, the con- text of SMEs. In particular, two practices commonly used in the human resource–performance  literature, job security and harmonisation, were not found to be applicable to the vast majority of  the pilot firms. HRM was measured through 17 items in the interview schedule. Although the respondents were  not directly asked about their motivation for introducing formal human resource practices, the vast  majority of respondents (77.6%) made at least one reference during the interview to worries about  being taken to an employment tribunal. This concern was linked to decisions to introduce more  formal human resource practices, for example:  •  •  •  •  • to advertise jobs and use formal recruitment methods; to  formally  document  potential  ‘problem,  underperforming  employees’,  which  prompted  the introduction of performance appraisals to try to avoid unfair dismissal cases; equal opportunities cases, which appeared to have contributed to the introduction of perfor- mance appraisals and performance-based compensation; the decision to seek Investor in People status and/or to hire a professionally qualified human  resource specialist; and/or an inability to keep track with frequently changing employment legislation. Thus, within this context, it is perhaps not surprising that the use of formal human resource  practices – even if used in a preventative or reactive context (i.e. to try and minimise being taken  to an employment tribunal, or once a case has been filed) – is quite common in UK SMEs and  perhaps higher than previously expected.6 The 2004 Workplace Employment Relations Survey  also found evidence that SMEs in the UK were utilising formal human resource practices to a much  greater extent than previously reported (see Forth et al., 2006 for a detailed discussion). In order to ensure that the human resource practices measured were widely dispersed within the  organisation – that the particular practice was applied extensively among the firm’s employees – it  was decided to use Guest et al.’s (2003) demanding cut-off point, whereby the item was counted if  it applied to 90 percent of the workforce. Thus, for each of the non-dichotomous variables, the  average number of specific items applying to the majority (90% or more) of the core workforce  was counted. For dichotomous items, the score was computed as a straight count of the number of  items  that  applied  to  the  whole  workforce. A  score  was  calculated  for  each  of  the  two  human  resource indices in 2007 and 2011 (Sun et al., 2007; Wright et al., 2005). The score of a firm indi- cates how extensively the 17 indicators of human resource practices are used. Scores were stan- dardised within the six areas, since the number of items describing the areas varied. Cronbach’s  alpha for the HRM index in 2007 and 2011 were 0.78 and 0.81 respectively. Performance. Consistent with the literature, a multidimensional measurement of performance was  used (Dyer and Reeves, 1995; Paauwe, 2009; Wright et al., 2005). The three indicators were financial  performance, innovation and labour turnover. During piloting, companies were asked about actual  Sheehan  555 objective performance. The vast majority of respondents declined to provide this data, yet were will- ing to provide subjective measures. Thus, the latter were collected in both survey periods. The  performance  questions  followed  a  format  similar  to  that  in  the  Workplace  Employee  Relations Survey (Forth et al., 2006), and were worded as follows: Here  I  would  like  your  opinions  on  how  your  company  is  performing.  Firstly,  can  you  compare  your  company’s performance over the past three years to that of close competitors in your industry/sector, for  the following two measures: (a)  (b)  financial performance; and  innovation (innovation is defined here as product and process innovation, as well as organisational  and marketing innovation. (Please only include new or significantly improved goods or services or the implementation of new or  significantly improved processes, logistics or distribution methods). Please rate your performance on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 = very much worse and 5 = very much better. Specific ranges on labour turnover were obtained. These were coded as follows: 0–4.9 percent (0);  5–14.9 percent (1); 15–50 percent (2); and over 50.1 percent (3) (see Guest et al., 2003). The ques- tion  on  innovation  reflects  the  recognised  importance  of  this  notion  for  sustained  competitive  advantage (Herrera and Sánchez-González, 2012). The definition of innovation used followed that  of the EU’s Community Innovation Survey (Parvan, 2007). The validity of perceptual indicators has been found by many researchers: in particular, Wall   et al.’s (2004) detailed comparative analysis from several studies between subjective and objective  measures  of  performance  found  significant  correlations  between  the  types  of  two  performance  measures (see also Dess and Robinson, 1984). However, in a more recent survey article, Forth and  McNabb (2008) concluded: ‘the main conclusion is that subjective and objective measures of per- formance are weakly equivalent but that differences are also evident’ (2008: 104). Thus, given  concern  about  the  potential  reliability  of  subjective  performance  measures,  several  steps  were  taken to determine the validity and reliability of the self-report data used in this analysis. Interclass  correlation coefficients (ICC) were examined between the self-report measures and those in the  Dun & Bradstreet database, and where these were not available for the sample companies, reports  from Companies House were utilised.7 ICC values are a rating of the ratio of between-rating vari- ance to total variance (Shrout and Fleiss, 1979). In this case, ICC(1) values were created to assess  the degree of agreement between the self-report measures and the archival Dun & Bradstreet and  Companies House data (profit per employee and total employment data were analysed). An ICC(1)  estimate is the proportion of variance in a measure explained by group membership (Bryk and  Raudenbush, 1992; Datta et al., 2005). In this analysis, the ‘group’ is identified as being the same  firm. Typically, when the ICC(1) value is large, a rating from a single source is likely to provide a  relatively reliable estimate; however, when ICC(1) is small, multiple responses from an organisa- tion are necessary to establish reliable estimates (Bliese, 2000; Datta et al., 2005). The results of this analysis demonstrate a high degree of consistency between the self-report  measures  (financial  performance  and  employment)  and  the  Dun  &  Bradstreet  and  Companies  House data in both time periods for profit per employee (ICC[1] in time 1 = 0.508; and ICC[1] in  time 2 = 0.519) and number of employees (ICC[1] = 0.735; and ICC[1] in time 2 = 0.762). While  there is no common standard for acceptable ICC(1) values, a value greater than 0.20 is generally  considered to be reliable (Ostroff and Schmitt, 1993). Thus, both of these items in both time peri- ods would be considered large and indicate reliability (Bliese, 2000). 556    International Small Business Journal 32(5) The potential presence of common method bias was examined using Harman’s Single Factor  Test, which was conducted by loading each of the study variables (24 in each time period) into an  exploratory factor analysis.8 The test resulted in 21 and 22 factors in time 1 and time 2 respec- tively, with an eigenvalue exceeding 1.0, and explained 95.2 and 95.8 of the cumulative variance  in the two time periods, respectively. This test provided evidence that common method bias was  not likely to be substantial (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). However, there is no consensus on how  many factors should emerge from the analysis (when only one factor emerges is it quite possible  that common method bias accounts for most of the relationships), and as the number of variables  increases, more factors are likely to emerge; thus the potential for common method bias cannot be  ruled out completely. Other recent studies on performance in SMEs that conduct similar tests also find evidence of the  reliability of single-respondent data (see for example, Messersmith and Guthrie, 2010; Messersmith  and Wales, 2011). This may reflect that, unlike a respondent from a large firm who is ultimately  accountable to multiple internal and external stakeholders, the majority of respondents in SMEs  were the CEOs, owners or managing directors, and thus highly accountable to themselves – thereby  potentially reducing the potential for common method bias. Control variables While  the  RBV  of  the  firm  is  the  primary  theoretical  framework  within  which  this  study  is  placed,  the  relationship  between  HRM  and  the  external  environment  and  to  organisational   strategy – a contingency framework – is used also to inform the selection of key control vari- ables. The importance of context, especially for small firms, is emphasised in the literature (see  in  particular,  de  Kok  and  Uhlaner,  2001;  see  also  Jackson  and  Schuler,  1995),  and  helps  to  inform the selection of the control variables used in this study. The control variables used here  are as follows: firm size and age (both variables are related and are found to be important for the  use of HRM in both large and small firms, reflecting the potential impact of economies of scale  and experience; Nguyen and Bryant, 2004; Rutherford et al., 2003); whether the firm operated  in the manufacturing or service sector; and whether the firm primarily pursued a ‘quality and/or  innovator’ or cost-based strategy. The relationship between HRM and performance is estimated by ordered logit analysis. The B  (regression coefficient) and the odds ratio have been retained to interpret the results. The odds ratio  indicates the probability that an event arises, and the probability that it does not (P/1-P). Odds  ratios measure the association between the human resource index and performance. The closer it is  to 1, the greater the link between the use of human resource practices and performance. The odds  ratio is also equal with the exponential of B(eB). Results A significant part of the analysis focuses on causal order: in particular, the potential for reverse  causality between the human resource index and the three performance indicators. The method  used here was influenced by Guest et al. (2003) and Wright et al. (2005), who propose a method  that is divided into three successive steps. First, the identification of a simultaneous association is  made between the HRM index and the performance measures in 2007 (time 1). Second, a longitu- dinal  analysis  is  tested,  made  possible  by  the  temporal  gap.  This  step  determined  whether  the  simultaneous associations were sustainable over time, and provided insight into temporal prece- dence. Temporal precedence implies that the proposed cause must exist in the time prior (the use  Sheehan  557 of a greater number of the selected human resource practices in 2007) to the proposed outcome  (estimates of performance in 2011) (see Cook and Campbell, 1979 and Wright et al., 2005 for more  detail). Third, previous performance is controlled for in the estimations. Therefore, this approach  takes  into  account  the  possibility  that  prior  performance  may  explain  the  adoption  of  human  resource practices (i.e. reverse causality). Table 2 shows the correlation analysis. This initial analysis of the key study variables shows that  all  of  the  firm  performance  indicators  in  2007  and  2011  were  significantly  associated  with  the  human resource index. None of the Variance Inflation Factors were above 2.4, indicating that mul- ticollinearity is not problematic with these data (Hair et al., 2006). Relationship between human resource management and performance:  simultaneous associations H1 proposed a relationship between HRM and performance at time 1. The results (see Table 3)  show that the human resource index is significantly positively related to profitability and innova- tion, both at the p<0.01 level; and significantly negatively related to labour turnover at the p<0.05  level. The odds ratios for the three measures were 1.28, 1.41 and -1.39, indicating increases by 28  and 41 percent for profitability and innovation and a decline of 39 percent for labour turnover,  when the human resource index increases by unity.9 Thus, H1 is not rejected, indicating that there  is indeed a positive simultaneous association between the use of the selected human resource prac- tices and the three performance measures. Whether these relationships are sustainable over time is  now examined. Relationship between human resource management and performance:  longitudinal associations Table 4 shows the results for H2, indicating that significant simultaneous associations persist after  introduction of the temporal shift. The significance level for profitability declines to p<0.05 but  remains at the p<0.01 level for innovation, and increases to p<0.01 for labour turnover. An increase  of unity of the human resource index implies an increase by 20 and 35 percent in the odds ratio for  profitability and innovation, and a 42 percent reduction in labour turnover. Thus H2 is not rejected,  thereby implying that investment in the selected human resource in 2007 continues to have a posi- tive effect on performance in 2011. Causal order H3 posited that any positive relationship between human resource practices and SMEs’ perfor- mance found at time 2 will be sustained when previous performance is controlled for in the estima- tions. Table 5 shows the significant and positive link between human resource and profitability and  innovation, and that the significant and negative link between human resource and labour turnover  at time 2 persists in spite of the control of the performance variables at time 1. That is, the relation- ships remain significant in 2011, even after controlling for performance in 2007. It should be noted  that the strength of the human resource–performance relationship did weaken once previous per- formance was controlled for in the estimations (Huselid and Becker, 1996 also report this when  controlling for previous performance) – this is likely to reflect that better performing firms are able  and/or more likely to invest in the selected human resource practices – but crucially, the relation- ships remain significant. So, the results suggest that increased use of the selected human resource  558    International Small Business Journal 32(5)                       0 1 0 – . 8 4 0   . 2 2 0 – . 5 1 0 . 9 1 0 . 7 2 0 . . 6 1 0 – . 8 6 0   . 1 7 0   . 2 1 0 – 8 2 0 . 9 0 0 – . 2 6 0 . 6 5 0 . 7 0 0 – . 2 6 0 . 1 6 0 . 5 4 0 – . 2 5 0 . 7 5 0 . 9 3 0 – . 8 6 0 . 7 5 0 . 2 4 0 . 8 4 0 – . 1 5 0 . 9 3 0 . 0 4 0 – . 7 4 0 . 1 5 0 . 8 3 0 . 7 6 0 . 7 2 0 – . 5 4 0 . 1 7 0 . 8 2 0 – . . 3 2 0 . 9 1 0 . 1 2 0 . 6 1 0 . 4 2 0 . 3 2 0 – . 2 1 0 . 9 0 0 . 5 2 0 – . 0 2 0 . 5 2 0 . 8 2 0 . 3 3 0 . 2 2 0 . 1 2 0 . 5 3 0 . 7 2 0 . 6 1 0 . 9 1 0 – . 5 2 0 . 5 1 0 – . 4 2 0 . 1 3 0 . 2 3 0 . 2 4 0 . 1 3 0 . 3 2 0 . 0 4 0 . 8 2 0 . 9 1 0 . 4 4 6 2 . 5 1 0 3 .

In other words, reverse causality is not found in the human resource– performance relationship for this sample of SMEs. Discussion Previously, a limited number of studies have found a positive relationship between a greater num- ber  of  human  resource  practices  and  SME  performance  in  both  a  cross-sectional  context  (Messersmith and Wales, 2011; Michie and Sheehan, 2008; Nguyen and Bryant, 2004; Verreynne  et al., 2011) and longitudinally (Razouk, 2011). The purpose of this research was to contribute to  this literature by examining whether there was a positive association between the use of a selection  of human resource practices and the performance of UK SMEs, and whether there was a problem  of reverse causality between these variables. The RBV of the firm, contingent and configurational frameworks, informed the derivation of  the study’s three hypotheses. H1 examined whether the use of a greater number of the selected  human  resource  practices  (estimated  by  an  increase  in  the  value  of  the  human  resource  index)  influences current UK SME performance. H2 linked the influence of human resources with future  SME performance; and finally in H3, the potential for reverse causality was tested. The  estimates  show  that  the  human  resource  index  is  positively  and  significantly  linked  to  profitability and innovation; in terms of labour turnover, the relationship is negative and signifi- cant. Accordingly, these findings confirm H1, that a greater use of the selected human resource  practices  is  associated  with  better  ‘current’  (2007)  performance. These  findings  are  consistent  with the cross-sectional analyses of Michie and Sheehan (2008) and Nguyen and Bryant (2004).  The results of the longitudinal analysis show that those firms with a greater number of the selected  human resource practices not only obtain better current performance, but are able to maintain bet- ter performance over time (H2). Most significantly, no evidence of reverse causality is found in  the human resource–performance relationship (H3). The relationships remained significant even  after controlling for previous performance. These findings are consistent with the longitudinal  analysis of French SMEs reported by Razouk (2011). Therefore, these results are consistent with  the RBV theory of the firm, which suggests that since a human resource system is complex and  dynamic, it is likely to be an important source of sustained competitive advantage. As such, these  findings offer an important empirical contribution to the theory of the firm literature. In addition,  they  heed  the  call  made  in  the  human  resource  literature  for  longitudinal  studies  to  eliminate  potential bias from simultaneity and speculation in the interpretation of the relationship between  human resource and performance. Conclusion Implications for practice The study has significant practical implications. The analysis has shown that there are significant  positive returns in terms of increased profitability, innovation and lower labour turnover associated  with human resource investment, including incrementally – as shown by the analysis of the odds  ratios. For example, an increase of unity in the human resource index in the first time period (2007)  is found to increase profitability and innovation by 20 and 35 percent respectively, and to reduce  labour turnover by 42 percent in the subsequent time period examined (2011). Given the potentially  high direct and indirect costs to SMEs associated with such investment, an examination is undertaken  of which of the selected practices have the most positive association with performance, and whether  Sheehan  561 these have changed over time. This is of particular importance in terms of practical recommendations  for SME owners, who are unlikely to be able to introduce all of the selected human resource practices  simultaneously and/or apply them to 90 percent or more of their employees. The disaggregated analysis (Table 6) demonstrates several important trends. First, consistent  with the aggregate (human resource) index analysis, the contribution to performance of the selected  human resource practices is found to increase over time. The six disaggregated HR practice group- ingswere analysed for the three performance measures (thus, a total of 18 disaggregated practice  groupings).In 2007, it was found that eight out of the 18 (44.4%) human resource interventions  were positively and significantly associated with the performance measures:  one in relation to  financial performance; two in relation to innovation; and five in relation to labour turnover. In  2011, it was found that 13 out of the 18 (72.2%) human resource interventions were positively  and  significantly  associated  with  performance:  four  in  relation  to  financial  performance  and  innovation (=eight); and five in relation to labour turnover. So, it appears that specific human  resource interventions have become more important in relation to the performance of SMEs over  time. It is now worth examining which practices made the most significant contribution and to which  performance measure. The 2011 analysis indicated that for financial performance, the following  human resource practices were most important: compensation; training and development and stra- tegic people management (p<0.05); and recruitment and selection (p<0.10). For innovation, the  following practices were significant: training and development and strategic people management  (p <0.05); and recruitment and selection and employee voice or consultation and information shar- ing (p<0.10). For labour turnover, the following practices were significant: recruitment and selec- tion; performance appraisal; training development and strategic people management (p<0.05); and  employee voice/consultation and information sharing (p<0.10). Perhaps the most important out- come of this analysis is the finding that strategic people management is significantly associated  with all three performance measures, and that its contribution to SME performance has increased  over time. It can be argued that this is evidence of an ever-increasing role of more formal human  resources, at least in the UK context. Despite the importance of individual practices, the results from Tables 3 to 5 show the value  of introducing practices as bundles or holistically – as evidenced by the higher R2 and log likeli- hood estimations when the practices are entered as an index rather than individually (Table 6).  Thus MacDuffie’s (1995) widely cited analysis of the importance of human resource bundles  appears to apply to this sample of SMEs. Another important finding for practice is that of all of  the human resource interventions across the measures, training and development is most signifi- cantly  associated  with  performance measures. The  association  between  training and  develop- ment and financial performance was not statistically significant in 2007, but by 2011 the results  were indeed significant (at the 0.05 level). This finding is consistent with the view that financial  returns  to  training  and  development  or  human  resource  development  interventions  are  only  realised over time. Such interventions are also likely to affect the retention of labour; greater  human resource interventions are associated significantly with lower labour turnover. This sug- gests that SMEs that utilise the selected human resource practices have a higher rate of labour  retention,  which  in  turn  provides  a  larger  pool  of  employees  to  benefit  from  future  human  resource interventions. The  possibility  that  the  most  successful  companies  use  more  human  resources  and  conse- quently obtain better financial performance was also examined: does firm success in terms of  better performance have a positive effect on propensity to invest in human resource practices  (Hiltrop, 1999; Paauwe and Richardson, 1997)?

The direction of causality was able to be determined, since the control of perfor- mance in 2007 did not produce a breakdown of the human resource–performance relationship in  the 2011 analysis. Thus, this study demonstrates that a greater investment in the selected human  resource  practices  has  a  positive  effect  on  subsequent  performance.  The  implications  of  this  finding for SME owners are significant. Limitations of the study and recommendations for future research While this study addresses a key methodological limitation in the HRM–performance literature,  that of causal order, it does not address other key limitations in the HRM literature. Perhaps the  most significant is the study’s single-respondent design, which not only creates the potential for  common method bias, but does not allow insight into the ‘black box’ problem – the how and why  of the relationship between HRM and performance, which is not explored.10 Another key limitation  is the selection of human resource practices examined, as it is recognised that there is no consensus  in the literature about which practices respondents should be asked (Guest, 2011). It is entirely  possible that the findings will be sensitive to the selection of practices investigated. The importance of informal human resources exacerbates this issue even further in the context  of SMEs (Marlow and Thompson, 2008).11 Reflecting in part the single-respondent nature of the  study’s design, important process issues of the effectiveness of human resources and the role of a  strong human resource system could not be examined either (see Guest and Conway, 2011 for an  analysis in the context of large firms). Khilji and Wang (2006) and Wright and Nishii (2006) have  emphasised the importance of the effectiveness of human resource implementation, in particular  the need to distinguish between intended and implemented practices. Given the evidence reported  by Marlow and Thompson (2008) about this dichotomy in the SME context, it suggests that this  issue may be of even greater magnitude in studies such as this one. One way to begin to address these limitations is by theory development specific to the manage- ment of human resources in the small firm context. The social constructionist approach taken by  Nolan and Garavan (2012) in their critical review of human resource development in small firms,  provides a valuable framework in which to commence such theory building. In addition to theory  building, careful design of future survey method studies or detailed case studies will be able to address  these important issues. This analysis has demonstrated that careful study and survey design has the  potential to address previous – although certainly not all – limitations found in the extant literature.  Thus, this research also flags up important opportunities for future research on the HRM–performance  relationship in SMEs, especially those that relate to obtaining a better understanding of the essential  processes that contribute to the relationship examined here (see Sanders and Frenkel, 2011 for an  overview of the process perspective in the large firm context). In addition, case studies should pro- vide greater insight into the role of internal and external contingencies and their evolution over time  on the relationships examined (e.g. Messersmith and Wales, 2011; Patel and Cardon, 2010). Final remarks This article contributes to the understanding of the role of human resources in the performance of  SMEs. In particular, by using a predictive methodology and explicitly testing for causal order, it  makes an important contribution to the HRM–performance literature generally. By examining the  human  resource–performance  relationship  longitudinally  and  testing  for  reverse  causation,  it  is  shown that investment in the selected human resource practices has significant positive effects on  564    International Small Business Journal 32(5) performance.  Since  these  relationships  were  maintained  over  time,  human  resource  investment  appears to be a key input for sustained competitive advantage in SMEs. Nevertheless, SME owners  must invest carefully, as the short-run costs of investment in human resource will be significant.  However, the medium to longer-term gains associated with this investment are demonstrated to  have significant positive effects for sustained competitive advantage. Finally, it has been argued  throughout the article that the use of formal human resource practices in the sample SMEs reflects,  at least in part, responses to the way in which labour is regulated in the UK and EU. Whether such  formality exists in less regulated labour markets, such as Canada and the USA and thus, whether a  positive association between human resource practices as measured in this study and performance  is found elsewhere, merits investigation. Appendix 1: Details of the telephone surveys Telephone interviews, utilising structured interviews, were used to generate the data. The selection  of this method was based in part on the successful use of telephone interviews in previous HRM– performance research in SMEs (see for example, Michie and Sheehan, 2008; Patel and Cardon,  2010). (The survey is available from the author upon request.) The following protocol was used. 1.  The main contact person identified from the Dun & Bradstreet database was sent a one-page  briefing of the survey objectives and the expected length of the interview (around 30 min- utes) was indicated. This was sent by both post and email (provided by Dun & Bradstreet;  the names, addresses and emails were checked by Google searches). The initial cover letter  indicated that all interview participants would be entered into a raffle draw for a Sunday  Times wine case and a £100 Marks & Spencer gift certificate. Each participant would receive  an executive summary of the study’s practical implications for SMEs. 2.  The selected person was contacted to enquire if they would agree to the telephone interview  and, if affirmative, a date and time for the interview was set. 3.  To ensure that the respondent understood the survey’s terminology they were sent a glossary  of definitions of the selected human resource practices, and examples of how they may be  implemented in the SME context – which was sent before the telephone interviews were  conducted. 4.  A  professional  telephone  interview  company,  which  the  primary  researcher  had  worked  with successfully in previous studies, was employed to conduct the interviews. The primary  investigator met with the team selected to conduct the interviews, and briefed them on the  study`’s aims and objectives, answering any questions about terms, wording of the survey  questions, etc. She also listened and advised during the pilot interviews undertaken – six in  2007 and five in 2011. Survey questions were revised in both time periods, based on these  pilot interviews. 5.  To generate a longitudinal sample, all firms that participated in the 2007 survey were sent  the executive summary as promised, and were offered 20 minute free ‘telephone surgeries’  with members of the research team, including the primary researcher. Of the 2007 firms, 117  availed  themselves  of  this  service.  Of  these,  91.2  percent  (107)  participated  in  the  2011  survey (approximately 31.8% of the panel, n = 336). Sheehan  Appendix 2 565 Table 7.

For example, Nguyen  and Bryant (2004) examined the following practices: recruitment and selection; training; job descriptions; performance  appraisals; and human resource plans. Focusing specifically on high-performance work system practices, Razouk (2011)  included the following in his analysis: appraisals; participation; sharing information; compensation; and communication. The  Workplace and Employment Relations Survey also used similar practices and reported that these practices were more  common in SMEs than previously evidenced (Forth et al., 2006). The numbers in Table 7 represent the percentage of sample firms where the human resource practice applied to 90% or  more of the workforce. Thus, for example, in relation to ‘Performance Appraisal’ (B), 58.7% and 67.2% of sample firms  used this practice, and it was applicable to 90% or more of these firms’ workforces. 566    Acknowledgements International Small Business Journal 32(5) I am grateful to Marc Blunden, University of Brighton, for research assistance. Notes   2.    1.  See Marlow (2002) and Ram et al. (2001) for analyses of how changes in the regulatory environment  impacts the formality of human resource practices. See also Reed (2010) for a detailed discussion of  labour market regulation and deregulation within the EU and the UK since 1979. It is also recognised that another significant limitation of the extant literature is the ‘black box’ problem,  which addresses issues of human resource processes: the ‘why’ of any human resource–performance  relationship (see for example, Guest, 2011; Sanders and Frenkel, 2011). In order to investigate these  ‘why’ issues, a multiple survey respondent and/or case study approach is required, which was beyond  the scope of this article.   3.  Thus, using the target response rate of 25 percent and a desire for broadly equal responses across the  selected sectors, the following quotas were set for completed interviews: 1500 with 150–170 interviews  in each of the nine sectors in 2007; 1540 with 150–170 in each sector; and for the panel, 397–400 with  40–50 completed interviews in each sector.   4.

I am grateful to an anonymous referee of this journal for highlighting this important issue.   5.    6.  Although there was a general consensus among respondents that the UK labour market was very highly  regulated, in reality, among the 30 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)  members, the UK had the third lowest level of employment protection (only Canada and the USA had  less protection in place in 2008; see OECD, nd).   7.  Objective data were available from either Dun & Bradstreet or Companies House for approximately 80  percent of the sample firms. Firms employing under 25 people and in the service sector were the least  likely to have any objective data available.   8.  There were 24 variables in each time period (17 human resource variables + 3 performance measures +  4 control variables).   9.  The analysis was disaggregated by the study’s nine sectors. While the coefficients for the following  industries were negative in the panel sample when all of the industries were entered in as separate  coefficients  (experiments  were  undertaken  with  various  base  categories,  such  as  ‘Printing’  (SIC  18.1) and ‘Management Consultants’ (SIC 70.2): ‘Restaurants and mobile food services’ (SIC 56.1)  and ‘Beverage serving activities’ (SIC 56.3), none of the sectors’ effects were statistically signifi- cant. Given the relatively small sample sizes for the panel at this level of disaggregation, analysis  was undertaken also for the full samples in 2007 and 2011. Interestingly, in 2007 ‘Restaurants and  mobile food services’ (SIC 56.1) and ‘Beverage serving activities’ (SIC 56.3) were significant and  negative  at  the  0.05  and  0.10  levels  respectively  in  the  2007  estimates;  while  ‘Management  and  consultancy services’ (SIC 70.2) and ‘Architectural and engineering activities’ (SIC 71.1) were sig- nificant and positive at the 0.05 and 0.10 levels respectively in the 2007 estimates. None of these  disaggregated industry results were significant in 2011. This may reflect some convergence in the  use of formal human resource practices across industries in UK SMEs. 10.  See Guest (2011) for a recent discussion. Ramsay et al. (2000) demonstrate the essential mediating role  that  employees  have  in  any  HRM–performance  relationship;  Nadin  and  Cassell  (2007)  show  the  mediating effect of the psychological contract.
