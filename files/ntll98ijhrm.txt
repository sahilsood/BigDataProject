In  general,  results  supported hypothesized  differences in  HR  practices of   rms from  different countries. In  addition, results indicated that HR  practices, speci  cally structural training and  development  and retention-oriented compensation, were related to various measures of   rm performance. Of  further  interest  was  the    nding  that  country  origin  moderated  relationships  of  HR practices  with    rm  performance;  in  general,  relationships  of  structural  training  and development  and  retention-oriented  compensation  were  stronger  for  Hong  Kong    rms. Implications of  the  results are discussed. Keywords Human  resource practices, country  origin,    rm performance, multinational corporations,  Hong  Kong,  cultural values Introduction During  the  last  decade, increasing  attention  has been  paid  to  the  area of  international human  resource  management  (IHRM),  which  is  concerned  with  human  resource management  issues  of  multinational  enterprises  (Schuler  et  al.,  1993;  Taylor  et  al., 1996).  Interest  in  IHRM  has  been  enhanced  by  recent    ndings  that  human  resource policies and practices can be a source of sustained competitive advantage to   rms (Lado and  Wilson,  1994;  Pfeffer,  1994).  As  scholars  in  international  human  resource management  have  noted,  however,  transferring  HR  policies  and  practices  to  different countries  can  be  problematic  (Huo  and  Von  Glinow,  1995;  Rosenzweig  and  Nohria, 1994).  For  example, multinational  corporations  (MNCs) are faced with  issues such  as how  to  align  HR  policies  and  practices  with  the  rest  of  the  corporation  (i.e.  global integration)  and  how  to  adapt  HRM  practices  to  the  local  environment  in  which  the subsidiary  is  operating  (i.e.  local  adaptation).  Among  other  factors,  scholars  have suggested  that  the  national  origin  of  the  MNC  is  a  major  in  uence  on  the  trade-off between  global  integration  and  local  adaptation  and  thus  necessitates  careful  study (Caligiuri  and  Stroh,  1995;  Schuler et al.,  1993;  Taylor  and  Beechler, 1993).  Because of  differences  in  cultural  values,  MNCs  of  different  country  origins  tend  to  have different  degrees  of  adaptation  to  local  conditions.  In  this  study,  we  investigate in  uences  of  country  origins  on    rms’  HRM  practices.  Additionally,  we  extend research by  investigating  whether  HRM practices are related to    rm performance and by investigating whether country origin of the   rm moderates the relationships between HRM practices  and    rm  performance. 0958–5192  ©  Routledge  1998 HR  practices  and    rm performance  of  MNCs 633 Scholars  have  proposed  that  two  major  in  uences  on  human  resource management practices  of  multinational    rms  are  local  contextual  factors  (such  as  labour  market conditions,  unionization,  legal  and  socio-political  environments)  and  the    rm’s home- country  culture (Brewster, 1995;  Jackson and Schuler, 1995;  Yang, 1992).  Firms have to  obey  local  regulations,  and  local  environmental  conditions  may  in  uence  the  HR practices of MNCs operating  in the host country  (Schuler  et al., 1993).  Another  major in  uence on HR practices of MNCs is the culture of the home-country (i.e. the country of origin) (Ferner, 1996).  Scholars have suggested that   rms from some countries, with certain cultural  values,  are better  able to adapt  to local conditions  than  are   rms from other countries that are more likely to transfer the practices used in their home country (Schuler  et  al.,  1993;  Taylor  and  Beechler,  1993).  In  addition,  culture  of  the  home country  is expected to in  uence   rms’ HR practices, because some practices are more acceptable to  employees  with  certain  cultural  values  (e.g.  individual  pay-for-perform- ance  plans  in  individualistic  countries)  (Hofstede,  1980;  Newman  and  Nollen,  1996; Von  Glinow,  1993).  In  this  study,  we  investigate  whether  country  origin  of  the    rm in  uences human resource practices and control for local contextual effects by sampling  rms  operating  in  the  same setting. Recent evidence suggests that a   rm’s HRM practices are related to its performance (Arthur,  1994;  Huselid,  1995;  Koch  and  McGrath,  1996).  Little  research  has investigated  relationships  between  HRM  practices  and    rm  performance  for  multi- national  corporations,  however. None  the less, some evidence suggests  that there may be a set of ‘best practices’ of HRM that leads to better   rm performance; such practices would,  presumably,  be  appropriate  for  MNCs  operating  in  various  settings  (Hiltrop, 1996; Huselid, 1995; Von Glinow, 1993). We investigate the ‘best practices’ hypothesis by  examining  relationships  between  HRM  practices  and    rm  performance.  Other evidence suggests, however, that the effectiveness of HRM practices depends upon the  rm’s strategic and environmental contingencies (Huselid, 1995). Therefore, we extend previous research by investigating  whether country origin of the   rm, which is thought to  in  uence  strategic  and  environmental  contingencies,  moderates  the  relationships between  HRM practices and    rm  performance. Theoretical  background In  uences of  country  origin  on  human  resource  practices  of  MNCs We  adopt  a  cultural  values  theoretical  framework  to  examine  the  effects  of  country origin on HR practices. Countries differ in their cultural values (Hofstede, 1980,  1991), which, in turn, are expected to in  uence both willingness to adapt to local conditions as well as the type of HR practices used by   rms. More speci  cally, we propose that   rms from countries with certain cultural values are more willing  and perhaps better able to adapt  their  HR practices to  local  conditions,  than  are    rms  from  countries  with  other values.  This adaptation  argument is consistent with Hannon  et al.’s (1995)  discussion. Similarly, we expect that cultural values associated with certain countries in  uence HR practices  directly  and  thus  some  HR  practices  are  more  likely  to  be  used  by    rms in their  overseas’  subsidiaries.  These  HR  practices  could  in  fact  be  more  acceptable  to certain  people  in  some  countries.  An  effective  HR  system  could  then  be  achieved  if there is  a  congruence  between  HRM policies  and  cultural  values  in  the  host  country. A  central  theoretical  concern  underlying  the    eld  of  IHRM  is  the  tension  between global integration and local adaptation (Hannon et al., 1995; Porter, 1986; Prahalad and 634 Hang-Yue  Ngo  et  al. Doz, 1987;  Rosenzweig  and  Singh,  1991).  On  the  one  hand,  MNCs desire some level of consistency in their HRM practices across countries (i.e. global integration).  On the other hand,  MNCs have  to adapt  their  HRM  practices to norms and regulations  in  the host  country  (i.e.  local  adaptation)  (Adler,  1986;  Dowling,  1989).  In  the  face  of  this basic  dilemma,  MNCs  have  adopted  one  of  three  general  strategies  for  managing  the work-force  in  the  host  country:  the  ethnocentric,  polycentric  or  geocentric  strategy (Caligiuri  and  Stroh,  1995;  Dowling,  1989).  MNCs  using  the  ethnocentric  strategy transfer  the  headquarters’  HR  practices  to  their  overseas  subsidiaries  in  order  to maximize  the  headquarters’  control  and  integrate  subsidiaries;  this  results  in  little,  or no,  local  responsiveness.  At the  opposite  extreme is the  polycentric  strategy  in  which MNCs adapt totally to local situations such that HRM practices are virtually identical to those used by local   rms. A third  general strategy, the geocentric strategy, attempts to balance  both  global  integration  and  local  adaptation  by  having  some  HRM  practices dictated by corporate headquarters yet allowing other practices to be in  uenced by local pressures. Country  origin of the MNC is thought  to in  uence which strategy is used to balance the tension between global integration and local responsiveness. This is because MNCs from  some  countries,  with  certain cultural  values,  may  be  more willing  to  reduce the amount  of  control  from  headquarters  and  allow  the  subsidiaries  to  adapt  to  local contexts  than  are  MNCs  from  other  countries  (Schuler  et  al.,  1993;  Taylor  and Beechler,  1993).  For  example,  we  expect  that    rms  from  countries  with  high uncertainty  avoidance  (Hofstede,  1980)  are  more likely  to  transfer HR practices from headquarters  to  local  subsidiaries  than  are    rms  from  countries  with  low  uncertainty avoidance  because  the  direct  transfer  of  practices  reduces  uncertainty  and  risks. Similarly, one might expect  that   rms from countries with a high  power distance  may centralize  control  and  therefore  would  be  less  likely  to  relinquish  control  of  HR practices to local subsidiaries (i.e. low local adaptation)  than   rms from countries with low power distance. Interestingly, researchers have found that   rms from Japan, which are  low  on  uncertainty  avoidance  and  high  on  power  distance  (Hofstede,  1980),  are more  likely  to  transfer  home-country  HR  practices  to  host  countries  and  pay  little attention  to  local  conditions  (Hiramoto,  1995;  Kopp,  1994;  Rosenzweig  and  Nohria, 1994;  Yoshino,  1976). An  additional  factor  thought  to  in  uence  the  extent  to  which    rms  will  give  up control  from  headquarters  and  allow  subsidiaries  to  adapt  to  contextual  factors  is  the similarity in culture between the country  origin  of the  MNC  and  the host  country;  the more  similar  the  cultures  the  more  locally  responsive  the  MNC  (Rosenzweig  and Nohria,  1994;  Taylor  et  al.,  1996),  presumably  because  the    rm  does  not  have  to change  its  practices  very  much.  For  example,  some  recent  evidence  suggested  that Japanese   rms operating  in  Asian contexts  tend to  adapt  to local conditions  (Amante, 1995; Rodgers and Wong, 1996; Wong 1996). Such results are explained by noting that although, in general, Japanese   rms tend to be relatively unwilling to allow subsidiaries to adapt to local conditions, because of the cultural similarity between Japan and Asian countries,    rms  are  allowed  a  greater  amount  of  local  adaptation  in  Asian  contexts. Country  of  origin  and  HRM In  this  study,  we  investigate  whether  country  origins  of  the  MNC’s  headquarters in  uences  the  HR  practices  of  subsidiaries  in  a  host  country  and  control  for  the  host country’s  contextual  factors  by  examining  MNCs  operating  in  a  single  country.  By HR  practices  and    rm performance  of  MNCs 635 examining  MNCs  operating  in  a  single  country,  this  research  design  controls  for contextual  factors,  such  as  work-force  characteristics,  labour-market  conditions,  the legal and socio-political  environments, etc., that vary across countries and are likely to in  uence the degree to which the MNC is able to transfer the HRM system of its parent company  overseas  (Rosenzweig  and  Nohria,  1994;  Taylor  et  al.,  1996).  Therefore, variability in HR practices associated with country origins are attributed  to the cultural in  uences from the headquarters to the overseas subsidiaries and/or to the similarity in cultures of the home country and the host country.  This research design has been used by  scholars  interested  in  the  similarities  and  differences in  HR practices  of  MNCs  of different  country  origins  operating  in  the  single  country  setting  (e.g.  Monks,  1996; Rosenzweig  and  Nohria,  1994;  Yuen  and  Hui,  1993). We chose Hong Kong as the single-country  setting for our study and examined local Chinese,  Japanese, British  and American   rms. Hong  Kong  is an  ideal  setting  for  our research because it is one of the world’s largest trading and   nancial centres and a place where  Asian  and  Western  culture  exist  side  by  side.  Additionally,  Hong  Kong  has numerous  MNCs,  in  addition  to  local  Chinese    rms,  and  these  MNCs,  which  come from  different  regions  of  the  world,  have  huge  investments  in  the  local  economy. Furthermore,  the  Hong  Kong  government’s  laissez-faire doctrine  and  the  resultant economic policies have fostered an environment where the ‘natural cultural tendencies’ of MNCs can operate freely (Shaw, Kirkbride et al., 1993). Evidence suggests that local Chinese   rms differ from MNCs from other countries in terms of their corporate culture (Lau  and  Ngo,  1996),  organizational  structure  (Ngo,  1996),  organization  development practices (Lau  and  Ngo,  1997)  and  employment  relations  (England,  1989).  Therefore, we expect local Chinese   rms will also differ from MNCs from other countries in terms of  HR  practices. Only one study  was found  that had  compared HRM practices of   rms from various countries  that  were  operating  in  Hong  Kong  (Shaw,  Tang  et  al.,  1993).  These researchers  suggested  that  national  culture  should  predict  HR  practices  and  grouped  rms  into  three  broad  categories  to  measure the  effects of  culture:  (1)  Western    rms included  MNCs  from  the  United  States,  Australia,  Britain  and  Canada;  (2)  the  local Chinese category included   rms from Hong Kong and Singapore; (3) the third category included    rms  from  Japan,  the  People’s  Republic  of  China,  and  all  other  countries. Although  such a rough  classi  cation is likely to dilute the ‘cultural effect’, since there is  still  considerable  variability  in  cultural  characteristics  within  each  group,  some differences  in  human  resource  practices  between  Anglo-American  and  Chinese    rms were reported  (Shaw,  Tang  et  al.,  1993).  As  they  expected,  Western  MNCs  in  Hong Kong  were more formalized and  systematic in  their HRM practices, were more likely to  use formal performance appraisal and  feedback systems, to  have  extensive  welfare and fringe bene  t programmes, and to provide more formal training to employees than were the  Chinese    rms.  Although  the  Shaw,  Tang  et  al.  (1993)  study  provides  some initial  evidence  concerning  how  national  culture  may  in  uence  HR  practices,  their study is somewhat limited by their collapsing across countries and by their measures of HR  practices.  We  extend  their  work  by  addressing  such  limitations,  by  conducting multivariate analyses and by linking HR practices to   rm performance and investigating whether  country  origin  moderates  relationships  between  HR  practices  and    rm performance. In  summary,  theoretical  and  empirical  evidence  suggest  that  the  HR  practices  of MNCs  will  vary  by  their  nationality  because  cultural  values  of  the  home  country in  uence the extent to which top management allows local subsidiaries a high degree of 636 Hang-Yue  Ngo  et  al. local  adaptation  and  because  certain  HR  practices  are  more  likely  in  countries  with certain cultural  values.  Therefore,  we  propose  this  general  hypothesis: Hypothesis  1: Country  origin  of  MNCs will in  uence the  human resource practices used  by    rms. In  addition  to  this  general  hypothesis,  we  propose  some  speci  c  directional hypotheses concerning how country origin in  uences HR practices. For example, local Chinese   rms tend  to  be centralized, paternalistic  and nepotistic,  with  little systematic planning  or structuring (Ngo, 1996;  Redding  and Wong,  1986).  Because local Chinese  rms tend to have little systematic planning  in HR activities (Lau and Ngo, 1997),  we expect  that  they  will  have  less  training  and  development  than    rms  from  other countries.  This is because Chinese tend  to  have less concern for  long-term strategy of developing  human resources, and therefore do not have much interest in human capital investment.  Additionally,  we  expect  that  the  cultural  value  of  individualism  versus collectivism (Hofstede, 1980) will in  uence   rms’ compensation plans. Speci  cally, we expect  that    rms  from  countries  higher  on  individualism  are  more  likely  to  use retention-oriented  compensation  plans  than    rms  from  countries  that  are  more collectivistic;  in  contrast,    rms  from  countries  higher  on  collectivism  are  expected  to use  seniority-based  compensation  plans.  Therefore,  we  expect  American  and  British  rms, which emphasize individualistic values, are more likely to base compensation on individual  performance so  as to  retain staff and  to  avoid  high  turnover,  whereas local Chinese    rms  and  Japanese    rms  are  more  likely  to  base  compensation  on  seniority, because their cultures are more collectivistic (Hofstede, 1980).  Finally,  we expect  that local  Chinese    rms  with  their  focus  on  family,  along  with  the  Chinese  in-group mentality  (Ngo,  1996;  Redding,  1986),  will  be  less  likely  to  use  expatriates  and  will therefore have a work-force which is less diverse than American, Japanese, and British  rms.  Such  arguments  lead  to  the  following  directional  hypotheses: Hypothesis  1a: Local  Chinese    rms  will  provide  less  structural  training  and development  than  American,  British,  and  Japanese   rms Hypothesis  1b: American  and  British  MNCs  will  rely  more  on  retention-oriented compensation  than  will  local  Chinese  or  Japanese    rms. Hypothesis  1c: Japanese  and  local  Chinese  MNCs  will  emphasize  seniority-based compensation  more than  will  American and  British    rms. Hypothesis  1d: Local    rms  will  have  less  diversity  in  staff  composition  than Japanese, American,  or  British    rms. Finally,  although  not  a  speci  c  hypothesis,  we  expect  that  Japanese  and  Chinese  rms  will  be  relatively  similar  to  each  other  in  terms  of  HR  practices  because  of similarities  in  their  national  cultures  (e.g.  in  uence  of  Confucianism).  Similarly,  we expect that American and British   rms will be more similar to each other than they will be  to  Chinese  and  Japanese    rms. Human  resource  practices  and    rm performance Recently,  scholars  have  argued  that  the  management  of  human  resources  can provide  rms with a sustained competitive advantage to the extent that the human resources add HR  practices  and    rm performance  of  MNCs 637 value, are rare, are not easily imitable and cannot be easily replaced with technological advances (Huselid, 1995;  Pfeffer, 1994;  Wright  and McMahan, 1992).  Some evidence supports the proposed relationships between human resource policies and practices and indicators of   rm performance (Arthur, 1994; Huselid, 1995; Koch and McGrath, 1996; MacDuf  e,  1995;  Russell  et  al.,  1985;  Terpstra  and  Rozell,  1993).  Researchers investigating  relationships between HR practices and   rm performance, however, have operationalized  HR practices in several different ways. For example, some researchers have  examined  only  one  HR  practice  (e.g.  staf  ng  practices:  Terpstra  and  Rozell, 1993),  other  researchers  have  viewed  HR  practices  as  control  systems  and  have therefore focused on compensation, incentive and reward systems (Koch and McGrath, 1996;  Snell,  1992).  Wright  and  McMahan  (1992)  argued,  however,  that  researchers should  examine  ‘bundles’  of  HR  practices  and  their  collective  effect,  rather  than  the effect  of  isolated  HR  practices,  on    rm  performance.  As  Peck  (1994)  noted,  human resource  activities  are  interdependent,  and  as a  whole  they  generate  certain  outcomes for the   rm. Recent studies by Huselid (1995) and MacDuf  e (1995)  provided  support for such arguments as they found that bundles of HR practices were signi  cantly related to  workers’ productivity  and    rm    nancial  performance. Little  research  has  investigated  effects  of  HR  practices  on    rm  performance  for MNCs. As Schuler  et al. (1993) noted,  however, MNCs must design the HR system to balance  the  dual  imperatives  of  local  responsiveness  and  global  integration  and  this balance  will  have  performance implications.  For  example,  Caligiuri  and  Stroh  (1995) presented evidence suggesting that MNCs that adopted ethnocentric strategies were less successful  than  companies  employing  other  strategies.  There  is,  however,  little systematic research on the impact of HR practices on performance of MNCs operating in  a  host  country.  None  the  less,  drawing  on  previous  research  suggesting  that  HR practices  are  related to    rm  performance,  we advance  this  general  hypothesis: Hypothesis  2: The  human  resource  practices  of  MNCs  will  be  related  to    rm performance. Based  on  current  literature,  we  also  propose  some  speci  c  directional  hypotheses concerning  relationships  between  HR  practices  and    rm  performance.  As  Koch  and McGrath  (1996)  noted,  there  are  several  reasons  to  expect  structural  training  and development  to  be positively  related to    rm performance. Speci  cally, systematic and well-planned  training  and  development  typically  increases  the    rm  speci  city  of employee  skills, which  not  only  provides  the    rm with  productive  employees, but  can also reduce employee turnover  because employees with   rm-speci  c skills may not be able  to  transfer  their  skills  directly  to  other    rms  and  be  equally  productive. Furthermore, more extensive training  and development can reduce expenses associated with  hiring  people  from  external  labour  markets  by  developing  internal  human resources  and  by  reducing  turnover  (Koch  and  McGrath,  1996).  Some  evidence supports  the  proposition  that  training  and  development  is  related  to  indicators  of organizational  performance  (Russell  et  al.,  1985).  Therefore,  we  propose  this hypothesis: Hypothesis 2a: The extent  of  structural training  and development  will be  positively related  to    rm  performance. Firms’  compensation  plans  are  also  thought  to  in  uence    rm  performance  through in  uencing employee behaviours.  Speci  cally,   rms can use compensation to motivate 638 Hang-Yue  Ngo  et  al. employees  to  increase  their  efforts  and  to  direct  their  efforts  towards  important    rm outcomes  (Gomez-Mejia  and  Balkin,  1992;  Heneman,  1992).  Propositions  from expectancy  theory  (Vroom,  1964)  suggest  that  pay  can  in  uence  performance  when employees perceive a relationship between their efforts and performance and when they then  obtain  a  valued  outcome  if  they  perform  well  (Heneman,  1992).  Thus, compensation  plans  targeted  at  retaining  productive  staff  by  emphasizing  individual- based,  outcome-oriented  HR  practices  are  likely  to  result  in  better    rm  performance. Drawing  on  such  logic  we  propose  the  following  hypothesis: Hypothesis  2b: Firms  with  more  retention-oriented  compensation  plans  will  have better performance. Finally,  more  diversity  in  a  work-force  is  thought  to  in  uence    rm  performance through  various  mechanisms (Cox  and  Blake,  1991;  Glick  et al., 1993).  For  example, greater  diversity  in  workers  leads  to  additional  perspectives  and  improved  creativity. Furthermore,  increased  staff  diversity  is  thought  to  lead  to  greater    exibility  and improved  decision  quality  because  of  the  additional  perspectives  applied  to  the problem.  Therefore,  drawing  on  this  logic  we  propose  this  directional  hypothesis: Hypothesis  2c: MNCs  that  emphasize  diversity  will  have  higher  performance, particularly  in  new  product  development. Interaction  effect of  country  origin  and  HR  practices  on    rm  performance As discussed above,  the ‘best  practices’ model  of HRM suggests that  more successful  rms tend  to use a similar set of HR policies and practices, such  as structural training and  development  and  retention-oriented  compensation  (Hiltrop,  1996;  Huselid,  1995). There is some evidence to support the proposition  that certain ‘best’ HR practices result in  higher  performance  of  MNCs  consistently  across  different  cultures,  irrespective  of their  national  origin  and  the  local  environmental  conditions  (MacDuf  e  and  Krafcik, 1992;  Wickens, 1987;  Von Glinow, 1993).  Such evidence suggests that there may be a universal set of ‘best’ human resource management practices that, if used by   rms, lead to  better    rm  performance. Conversely,  or  perhaps  additionally,  the  effectiveness  of  the  human  resource practices  may depend  upon  contextual  factors such  as  the    rm’s  strategic orientation, the  operating  environment,  the    rm’s  culture  and  the    rm’s  country  origin  (Huselid, 1995).  Literature  in  strategic  HRM,  for  example,  suggests  that  the  matching  of  HR practices  with  organizational  and  environment  contexts  will  result  in  high    rm performance  (Dyer  and  Reeves,  1995).  Organizational  effectiveness  depends  on whether there is a ‘cultural   t’ between HR practices and the dominant value system of the    rm  (Mendonca  and  Kanungo,  1994).  Evidence  indicates  that  country  origin in  uences    rms’  culture  and  value  systems  (Lau  and  Ngo,  1996).  Because the    rms’ value systems in  uence whether a certain HR practice   ts, it seems likely that country origin  will  in  uence  the  relationships  of  HR  practices  with    rm  performance. Furthermore,  organizational  members  may  have  certain  expectations  about  the  HR practices  of  the    rm,  given  its  country  origin  and  its  internal  value  system;  these expectations, in turn should in  uence their work behaviours and hence the effectiveness of  HR  practices  such  that  practices  that  meet  expectations  will  be  more  effective. Finally,  although  certain  HR  practices  may  be  the  ‘best’  practices  in  terms  of in  uencing    rm performance,   rms from some countries,  with  certain cultural  values, HR  practices  and    rm performance  of  MNCs 639 may  not  optimally  implement  these  practices  in  a  foreign  country.  For  example, Newman  and  Nollen  (1996)  noted  that  pay-for-performance  plans  are  successful  in Anglo  countries,  but  are  not  as  successful or  popular  in  other  parts of  the  world. As Huselid  (1995)  noted,  it  is possible  there can be  a set of  best  HR practices that in  uence   rm performance and   rm performance also may be in  uenced by the ‘  t’ of the  HR  practices  with  the    rm’s  cultural  values.  For  example,  pay-for-performance plans  may  be  positively  related  to    rm  performance  across  countries,  and  such relationships  may be stronger  for countries with  individualistic  values. As statisticians have noted, it is possible to have both a meaningful interaction effect and a meaningful main  effect,  although  the  signi  cant  interaction  quali  es  interpretation  of  the  main effects  (Kirk,  1968).  Therefore,  we  propose  that  certain  HR  practices  are  positively related  to    rm  performance  (hypothesis  2)  and  we  also  propose  that  country  origin moderates  the  relationships  of  HR  practices  with    rm  performance. Hypothesis  3: Country  origin  will  moderate  the  relationships  of  human  resource practices  with    rm  performance. To summarize, we extend research by examining HR practices of   rms operating  in a single setting, namely Hong Kong. More speci  cally, we investigate whether country origin in  uences   rms’ HR practices. Additionally,  we investigate relationships  of HR practices with   rm performance, hypothesizing  that certain HR practices will be related to   rm performance, and that country origin will moderate the relationship between HR practices  and    rm performance. Method Procedure  and  sample A survey was mailed to the human resource directors of 1700   rms that had over   fty employees  in  Hong  Kong.  A three-wave mail design  was employed  with the    rst and third mailing containing the invitation letter, the questionnaire and a postage-paid return envelope.  The  second mailing was a reminder letter. We received 332  responses  for a 20 per cent response rate. Although  we would have desired a higher response rate, the response rate for surveys in Hong Kong is typically lower than in the West and a 20 per cent  response  rate  is  typical  (Ngo,  1996;  Redding  and  Pugh,  1986).  However,  recent studies using similar research design with a US sample had a similar response rate (see Delery and Doty, 1996). Respondents indicated the country origins of their   rms. Of the responding    rms,  99    rms  are  local  Chinese    rms,  82  are  American    rms,  38  are Japanese   rms, 34 are British   rms and the remaining are primarily other European and Asian    rms  and  joint  ventures.  For  this  study,  we  used  only  the  local  Chinese, American,  Japanese  and  British    rms  (n5 253).  Many  of  the    rms  were  involved  in manufacturing  (31  per  cent),  with  other    rms  in  trading  (14  per  cent),    nance  and banking  (12  per cent),  and  other  types  of  businesses. Measures HR practices One section of the survey included a list of twenty-  ve human resource management  practices.  Some  of  the  items  were  taken  from  Peck’s  (1994)  study. Respondents were asked to describe how closely these items match their organizations’ current policies and practices on a 5-point  Likert scale, ranging from strongly  disagree 640 Hang-Yue  Ngo  et  al. (1)  to  strongly  agree (5). Following  Peck’s (1994)  analytical strategy, we conducted  a principal  component  factor  analysis  with  varimax  rotation.  Our  purposes  were  to identify  possible  underlying  dimensions  of  these  twenty-  ve  HRM  practices  and  to summarize them with a small number of ‘derived’ variables. Examination  of the scree test suggested  four  factors that  accounted  for  37 per cent of the  variance of the  items. We assigned items to scales only when the item had a factor loading of greater than .4 for a single factor (see Table 1). We also conducted  split-halves  factor analyses of the sample, and adopted different rotation techniques in order to ensure the stability of the factor  structure.  No  signi  cant  deviation  from  the  current  results  was  detected, however. (seven  items,  alpha5 The   rst factor, which included items measuring the   rm’s training and development practices  and  formalization  of  human  resource  procedures  was  labelled  structural .72).  These  items  are  sometimes training  and  development considered characteristics of an internal labour market orientation (Peck, 1994) and the  rm’s  willingness  to  invest  in  human  capital.  The  second  factor,  labelled  retention- oriented compensation, included items measuring the   rm’s compensation practices and items  measuring  the    rm’s  philosophy  and  practices  to  reduce  turnover  (increase .64).  The  third  factor,  labelled seniority- retention)  of  employees  (seven  items, alpha5 based compensation, included two items (alpha5 .49) indicating that compensation was tied to seniority and the job title. This scale re  ects the   rm’s emphasis on hierarchical status.  The  fourth  factor,  diversity,  included  two  items  (alpha5 .46)  measuring  the extent to which the staff was composed of expatriates and how diverse it was in terms of  demographic  characteristics.  This  factor  is  a  generic  measure  of  the    rm’s heterogeneity  of  its  human  resources. Firm performance Respondents were asked to indicate their   rm’s performance over the  last  three  years  as  compared  to  the  industry’s  average  in  these  areas:  sales,  net pro  t, development of new products/services, satisfaction of employees and retention of essential  employees.  A  5-point  scale  ranging  from  bad  (1)  to  very  good  (5)  was used. Analyses  and  results Table 2 shows  the  means, standard deviations  and correlation matrix for  all variables. In  general,  the  indicators  of    rm  performance  were  moderately  correlated  with  each other  (rs  range  from  .32  to  .78).  Interestingly,  the  HR  practices  were only  somewhat related  to  each  other.  Speci  cally,    rms  that  provided  more  structural  training  and development tended to use retention-oriented  compensation  (r5 .01). Similarly, diversity  was related  to  retention-oriented  compensation  (r5 .05).  None  of  the other  correlations  among  the  HR  practices were signi  cant. .14,  p, .48,  p, To test hypothesis  1, which hypothesized  that the country origin of a   rm in  uences its  human  resources  practices,  we  conducted  a  multivariate  analysis  of  variance, followed  by  univariate  analyses of  variance  and  a multiple  comparison  post  hoc LSD test  to  determine  which  country  origins  were  signi  cantly  different  from  the  others.

Results indicate that the local Chinese and Japanese   rms provided  similar amounts of training and development and provided signi  cantly less than US or British   rms, who did not differ from each other. Turning  to  retention-oriented  compensation,  results  provided  partial  support  for hypothesis  1b  in  that  the  US  and  British    rms  provided  more  retention-oriented compensation than the local Chinese or Japanese   rms, although the difference between the  British   rms and  the local  Chinese    rms was not  signi  cant. Turning  to  seniority- based  compensation,  the Japanese   rms were highest  in  seniority-based  compensation and were signi  cantly different from all other   rms in partial support of hypothesis  1c. Finally,  in  support  of  hypothesis  1d,  the  local  Chinese    rms  were the  least diverse  in staff  composition  and  were  signi  cantly  different  from  all  other    rms.  Somewhat surprisingly,  Japanese   rms were the most diverse and were signi  cantly more diverse than   rms originating from the US. This result can be explained by the extensive hiring of Japanese expatriates as managers in the local Japanese   rms (Wong, 1996). Taken in sum,  these  results  provide  strong  support  for  the  hypothesis  that  country  origin in  uences   rms’ human resource management practices and, in general, the pattern of results tended  to  support  our  a  priori  directional  hypotheses,  with  a  few exceptions. To test the effects of HR practices on   rms’ performance and their interaction effects with  country  origin,  as  proposed  in  hypotheses  2  and  3,  hierarchical  moderated regression analysis was performed. To control for effects of   rm size and country origin on  the  indicators  of    rm  performance,    rm  size,  measured  as  the  total  number  of employees,  was  entered  in  step  1  and  country  origin,  entered  as  three  dummy  coded 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 Table  2 Means,  SD  and  Correlations  between  HR  practices, country  origins  and  performance ¯x SD 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Country 1 US 2 Japan 3 UK 4 Local  Chinese HR  practices 5 Structural training and  development 6 Retention-oriented compensation 7 Seniority-based compensation 8 Diversity Performance 9 Sales 10 Net  pro  t 11 New  products .32 .15 .13 .39 3.24 3.69 3.03 2.51 3.72 3.54 3.36 .47 .36 .34 .49 .57 .45 .74 .84 .85 .92 .90 development 12 Employee  satisfaction 3.23 3.44 13 Employee  retention 14 Employee  size 5.50 .73 .84 1.18 .06 .04 .07 Notes N5 253  * 5 p# .05  ** 5 p# .01. .29** .27** 2 .56** 2 .17** .34** 2 .32** .16* 2 .09 .14* 2 .13* .11 .08 .21** 2 .09 .17** .10 .01 .11 .06 .16* 2 .20** 2 .14* 2 .20** .07 .26** .07 .10 .02 .01 .04 .10 .03 .06 .02 .01 .02 .01 .12 .16* .11** .06 .08 .14* .48** .06 .12 .21** .31** .35** .32** .16* .17** .00 .14* .00 .15* 2 .28** 2 .29** 2 .04 .05 .03 .04 .03 .78** .13* .40** .36** .22** 2 .03 .06 .09 .14* 2 .16* .41** .12 .35** .15* .10 .47** .42** .36** .13* .44** .32** .07 .61** .04 .05 H R   p r a c t i c e s   a n d   r m   p e r f o r m a n c e   o f   M N C s 6 4 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 644 Hang-Yue  Ngo  et  al.

The third step of  the  hierarchical  regression  analyses  entered  the  four  measures  of  HR  practices. Support  for  hypothesis  2,  which  hypothesizes  that  HR  practices  are  related  to    rm performance,  would  be  indicated  by  a  signi  cant  increase  in  R2 when  the  set  of  HR practices are entered in the equation.  Finally,  in step 4, the cross products  of each HR practice and each dummy coded variable for country origin (twelve interaction terms in total) were entered as a set. Support  for hypothesis  3, which hypothesizes that country origin of the   rm moderates the effects of HR practices on   rm performance, would be indicated  by  a signi  cant increase in  R2 when the  set of cross-products  are entered in the  regression  equation. As indicated in Table 4, the set of HR practices explained signi  cant variance in all of  the  indicators  of    rm  performance  except  for  sales.  Examination  of  the  regression coef  cients indicates that   rms that provided  more structural training and development created  more  new  products,  had  more  satis  ed  employees  and  had  higher  sales.  In addition,    rms higher  in retention-oriented  compensation  reported greater pro  t, more new  products  (statistically  signi  cant  at  the  .1  alpha  level),  more  satis  ed  employees and greater retention of employees. Neither diversity nor seniority-based compensation was signi  cantly  related to  any  of  the  performance  measures. None  the  less, taken  in sum,  such  results  indicate  that  HR  practices  are  related  to    rm  performance,  with structural  training  and development  and greater usage of retention-oriented  compensa- tion  as particularly  important. The regression results also provide  partial support for hypothesis  3, which proposed that  country  origin  moderates the  effects of  HR  practices  on    rm  performance. More speci  cally,  the  set  of  interaction  terms  explained  additional  variance  in  employee satisfaction and employee retention, providing partial support for hypothesis 3. Because local  Chinese    rms  were  the  contrast  group  used  in  the  dummy  coding  for  country origin,  examination  of  the  signi  cant  interaction  regression  coef  cients  provides information  about  relationships  of  variables in  comparison  to  the  local  Chinese    rms. For  example,  the  signi  cant  regression  coef  cients  indicate  that  the  relationship Table  4 Hierarchical regression results of  HR  practices and  country  origins  on    ve performance  measures Sales Net  pro  t D R2 .01 .03* .03 .05 Employee  size Country US Japan UK HR  Practices Compensation  (retention) Compensation  (seniority) Structural training Diversity Interactions Retention  x  US Retention  x  Japan Retention  x  UK Seniority  x  US Seniority  x  Japan Seniority  x  UK Training  x  US Training  x  Japan Training  x  UK Diversity x  US Diversity x  Japan Diversity x  UK Total  R2 Adjusted  R2 N .06 2.82* .62 2 1.70 .06 .11 .44* .01 .14 .20 .62 .19 .10 .07 .37 .62 .10 .10 .31 .00 .12† .04 243 Notes † p# .10  * 5 p# .05  ** 5 p# .01.

Similarly,  the  relationship  between  training  and employee  retention  was  negative  for  Japanese   rms compared  to  local  Chinese    rms. Finally, the use of retention-oriented  compensation  was negatively related to employee retention  for  US    rms  compared  to  local  Chinese    rms. To  investigate  further  how  country  origin  moderates  the  relationship  between  HR practices  and    rm  performance  we  computed  subgroup  (i.e.  country  of  origin) correlations  for  the  signi  cant  interaction  effects,  namely  training  with  satisfaction, training  with  retention  and  retention-oriented  compensation  with  retention,  and  tested for signi  cant differences among the correlations. Results indicated that the relationship of  structural  training  and  development  with  employee  satisfaction  was  signi  cantly stronger  for  local  Chinese    rms  (r5 .18)  or  Japanese .22). Similarly, the relationship of structural training and development with  rms (r5 retention  was  stronger  for  local  Chinese    rms  (r5 .28)  compared  to  Japanese    rms .19).  Finally,  the  relationship  of  retention-oriented  compensation  with  employee (r5 retention  was signi  cantly  stronger  for  local  Chinese    rms (r5 .38)  than  for  US   rms (r5 .02). Taken in sum, such results provide some support for the hypothesis  that the relationship  of  HR  practices  with    rm  performance  is  moderated  by  country  origin. .57)  compared  to  American  (r5 Discussion We adopted a cultural values perspective to investigate the effects of country origin on  rms’ human resource practices for MNCs. We extended  recent works in international human resource management by investigating relationships between country origin, HR practices  and    rm  performance  of  MNCs  in  Hong  Kong.  Our  results  indicate  that MNCs  of  different  country  origins  differ  considerably  in  their  HRM  practices, particularly in training and development and compensation. Furthermore, we found that HR practices are  related  to  various  measures of    rm  performance.  Of  further  interest was the    nding  that  country  origin  moderated  the  relationships  between HR practices and    rm  performance. We  proposed  that  country  origin  would  in  uence  HR  practices,  in  part,  because certain HR practices would be acceptable in some countries with certain cultural values. It is also likely  that some of the HR practices used in headquarters  will  be  transferred to foreign  subsidiaries. The proposition  that cultural values would  in  uence   rms’ HR practices also  led  us  to  make speci  c  directional  hypotheses  concerning  HR  practices used  by    rms  originating  from  certain  countries.  Although,  in  general,  the  results supported  our  hypotheses,  further  research  is  necessary  to  investigate  the  speci  c effects of  cultural  values  on  HR practices.  For  example,  researchers might  attempt to measure HR practices of   rms from various countries and relate such practices to some speci  c  cultural  values,  perhaps  using  Hofstede’s  (1980)  values  framework.  Admit- tedly,  it  would  be  dif  cult  to  obtain  data  regarding  HR  practices  from  various    rms located  in  numerous  countries.  None  the  less,  such  an  effort  could  provide  further insight  into how cultural values in  uence HR practices, albeit that different contextual variables (such  as socio-legal  factors, labour  market conditions,  work-force  character- istics)  have  to  be  controlled. We  also  proposed  that  country  origin  would  in  uence  HR  practices  of  MNCs because  cultural  values  of  countries  would  in  uence  the  extent  to  which    rms  from certain countries  would  relinquish  control  from headquarters and allow subsidiaries to devise HR practices that adapted to local conditions. Again, future research is called for 2 2 2 HR  practices  and    rm performance  of  MNCs 647 to study  to what extent cultural values of home countries in  uence the degree of local adaptation  in  overseas  af  liates.  Cross-cultural  design  that  attempts  to  measure  HR practices of MNCs from several countries that operate in various  settings is needed so as to  investigate  whether  MNCs from some countries  are more  adaptable  than  MNCs originating from other countries. Furthermore, researchers need to consider similarity in cultural  values  between  the  host  and  home  countries. Our results provided  tentative support  for the  proposition  that, because of similarity in cultural values, local Chinese and Japanese   rms would be similar to each other and  rms from Britain and the US would be more similar to each other and that, in general, the  Western    rms  would  be  different  from  the  Asian    rms.  Results  indicated  no differences  between  US  and  British    rms  in  their  HR  practices.  There  were  some interesting  differences  between  Japanese  and  local  Chinese    rms,  however.  Speci  - cally,  local  Chinese    rms  were  less  likely  to  use  seniority-based  compensation  than were  Japanese    rms.  Similarly,  local  Chinese    rms  were  the  lowest  on  diversity whereas  Japanese    rms  were  highest.  Such  results  support  our  distinction  between Asian countries and lend credence to our suggestion that researchers should not collapse across  countries  to  create ‘cultural  groups’. In  the  present  study,  we  also  extended  previous  research by  investigating  relation- ships  of  HR  practices  with  various  indicators  of    rm  performance.  As  suggested  by scholars  in  this  area (Huselid,  1995;  MacDuf  e,  1995;  Wright  and  McMahan,  1992), we  examined  several  key  aspects  of  HR  practices  simultaneously.  As  hypothesized, retention-oriented  compensation  and  structural  training  and  development  were  pos- itively  related  to    rm  performance,  although  we  found  no  effects for  seniority-based compensation  and  diversity  on    rm  performance.  We  must  be  cautious  in  drawing conclusions  about  these  latter  two  variables  because  their  low  reliability  probably reduced  the  power  of  observing  relationships  with  the    rm  performance  measures. None the less, our results add to the growing  literature suggesting  that management of  rms’ human resources can provide   rms with a competitive advantage (Huselid, 1995; Lado and Wilson, 1994;  Pfeffer, 1994). In speci  c, structural training and development and  retention-oriented  compensation  seem to  encourage  efforts and  enhance  perform- ance  of  local  employees  working  in  the  MNCs. Results  provided  some  support  for  the  hypothesis  that  country  origin  moderates relationships  between  human  resource  practices  and    rm  performance.  More  speci  - cally, the set of interactions terms added signi  cant explanatory  variance for employee satisfaction and employee retention. Examination of the interaction terms suggested that the  relationship  between  structural  training  and  development  and  satisfaction  and retention  was  weaker  for  Japanese    rms  in  contrast  to  local  Chinese    rms.  More speci  cally,  structural  training  and  development  was  positively  related  to  satisfaction and retention for local Chinese   rms (rs5 .57 and .28, respectively) but was negatively related to these outcome variables for Japanese   rms (rs5 .19, respectively). Furthermore,  the  relationship  of  structural  training  and  development  with  employee satisfaction was stronger for local Chinese   rms than for US   rms (r5 .18). Therefore, although  local Chinese    rms tend  to have  less structural  training  and  development,  as indicated by examination of means (presented in Table 3), the training they provided is more effective in  increasing employee satisfaction and  retention  than that  provided  by Japanese and  US   rms. Interestingly,  the  relationship  of  retention-oriented  compensa- tion  with  employee  retention  was  stronger  for  local  Chinese  and  Japanese    rms compared  with  American    rms  (rs  of  .38,  .36.  and  2 .02,  respectively).  Retention- oriented  compensation  plans did  not  increase retention  for  American   rms, but  did  so .22 and 2 2 648 Hang-Yue  Ngo  et  al. for local Chinese and Japanese   rms. Although  not  a speci  c hypothesis,  we expected that    rms  from  individualistic  countries,  such  as  the  US,  would  be  more  effective  in using  retention-oriented  compensation  than  would    rms  from  collectivistic  countries, such as Hong Kong and Japan (Hofstede, 1980).  These results are opposite of what we expected,  however.  One  interpretation  of  these    ndings  is  that  local  Chinese  and Japanese   rms were better able to use retention-oriented compensation in a manner that aligns with the values of local Chinese employees. The US   rms, in contrast, may have used  retention-oriented  compensation  in  a more individualistic  manner,  which  did  not match  the  values  of  the  local  employees  and  therefore  had  no  effect  on  reducing turnover. We want to acknowledge  certain limitations of our study.  First, the  results from the factor analysis  of  the  HR practices  were not  intuitively  apparent.  Because there is no theory  specifying  how  the  twenty-  ve  HR  practices  should  be  grouped  together,  we followed  recommendations  of  Guest  (1997)  and  Wood  and  Albanese  (1995)  and conducted  an  exploratory  factor  analysis  on  the  items.  The  use  of  factor  analysis  is based on the assumption that the HR practices are related to each other in certain ways that can be captured by a few underlying dimensions. Our intent in using factor analysis was  to  identify  possible  underlying  dimensions  of  the  twenty-  ve  items  describing HRM  practices  and  to  summarize  these  items  with  a  small  number  of  ‘derived’ variables.  These  derived  variables  were  used  for  subsequent  statistical  analysis  and were conceptualized  as  representing  certain  ‘bundles’  of  HR  practices.  There  is  little theory specifying how HR practices should be bundled together or to explain why some items load  on one dimension  instead of  the other. Furthermore, because of our single- sample research design,  we are not  able to  assess the  stability  of  the  four  derived  HR measures by  using  another  independent  sample. Clearly, additional  research is needed to  replicate our  factor structure  and  further  investigate  which  HR  practices tend  to  be bundled  together. As discussed above, the reliability for two of our measures of HR practices was lower than  we  would  have  desired  and  may  have  limited  detecting  relationships  of  these practices with    rm performance. We did    nd  that  country  origin  in  uenced  these HR practices, however,  notwithstanding  the  low  reliability.  Our  measures of  performance, although appearing to be content valid and acceptable in organizational survey research, were  single-item  perceptual  measures.  Therefore,  future  research  might  replicate  our results  with  objective  measures  of    rm  performance.  Additionally,  our  response  rate was lower than we would have desired, and, although  the sample appeared representa- tive  of    rms  in  Hong  Kong,  clearly  there  may  be  issues  associated  with  the generalizability of the results given the response rate. Finally, although all the measures were  collected  from  a  single  survey,  it  seems  unlikely  that  method  variance  is  an alternative explanation  for  the effects of country  origin  on  HR practices or the pattern of  relationships  we  found  between HR practices  and    rm  performance. Much of the prior scholarly research in the area of IHRM focuses on corporate-wide and global issues. Relatively few studies address HR policies and practices of MNCs at the host-country  level. The present study   lls this research void,  and contributes  to the existing  literature  in  the  following  two  ways.  First  of  all,  we  investigate  the relationships  between country  origin  of  MNCs and HR practices, and  extend  previous studies by examining their impact on   rm performance. Second, instead of focusing on a  single  HR  practice  such  as  expatriates’  assignment  and  reward,  we  analyse  several major aspects of HRM (including  training and development, performance management and  compensation,  and  diversity  of  the  work-force)  simultaneously,  and  relate  them HR  practices  and    rm performance  of  MNCs 649 systematically to various indicators of   rm performance. Results indicate a moderating effect of country origin on the relationships between HR practices and performance, and suggest  the  importance  of  ‘cultural    t’  to  HRM.  This  is  an  area  that  deserves  to  be explored  in  future  research.
