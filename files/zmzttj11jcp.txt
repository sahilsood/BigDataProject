However, most people query on the implementation and performance of environmental management. In this paper, the manufacturing SMEs in Northern China with different pollution levels are studied to explore the main forces (e.g., government, society, market, and enterprise itself) driving SMEs for promoting environmental management. It focuses on the correlation between environmental manage- ment and economic performance for SMEs at different pollution levels. The results show that SMEs of different pollution levels have signiﬁcant differences in the relationship of driving forces and perfor- mance. First, for SMEs with high-pollution levels, social and market driving forces and government incentives are revealed having a signiﬁcant effect on their environmental performance. Driving forces from within the enterprise itself and the market provide a positive effect on the economic performance, while social forces have a negative effect. Second, for SMEs with light pollution, social and market driving forces, and government assistance play a supporting role on corporate environmental performance improvement. It is also found that the driving force of the enterprise itself does not have a signiﬁcant effect on the environmental performance for SMEs with different pollution levels. In addition, the environmental performance and economic performance for SMEs with high or light-pollution levels are positively correlated. Further, it shows that the environmental performance is moderately correlated with ﬁnancial indices, but not signiﬁcantly with the non-ﬁnancial indices. Ó 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction The trend of stricter international regulations, conventions for environmental protection, and the rise of consumer environmen- talism impose great challenges to enterprises (Chen et al., 2006), especially for the small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (Peres and Stumpo, 2000). Because of some endogenous and exogenous reasons, the performance of environmental manage- ment of SMEs is still not satisfactory, and serious pollution acci- dents have been recorded from time to time (Shi et al., 2008; Cordano et al., 2010), which seriously damaged the natural envi- ronment and aroused safety hazards due to pollution generated as a consequence of companies’ operations, leading to environmental accidents such as excess emissions of waste water, gas or other solid waste pollutants. * Corresponding author.

SMEs accounted for more than 90% of the total number of manufacturing establishments in China in 2010, and they contribute signiﬁcantly to social and economic development. However, SMEs has created signiﬁcant negative environmental impacts, which may harm neighboring residents’ health due to 1 According to the law of SMEs promotion in China in 2003, the characteristics of the number of employees, the annual revenues and total assets are used as criteria to deﬁne SMEs. For the manufacturing industry, SME is deﬁned as either less than 2000 employees, an annual turnover of no more than RMB Yuan 300 million, or a total asset of no more than RMB Yuan 400 million. While medium-sized enter- prises are deﬁned as those having more than 300 employees, an annual turnover of more than RMB Yuan 30 million, and a total asset of more than RMB Yuan 40 million, others are deﬁned as small businesses. S.X. Zeng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 19 (2011) 1426e1437 1427 obsolete equipment, inexperienced labor, or insufﬁcient ﬁnancial resources, especially in the most energy-intensive and polluting industries in China (Diao et al., 2009; Shi et al., 2008). It was re- ported by China Environmental Protection Administration that there are 40e50 percent of environmental pollution brought about by SMEs in China, and among the 30 million SMEs, 80 percent of them produced environmental pollution (Zhou, 2005). There are increasing pressures on Chinese ﬁrms from a number of different sources, such as governmental regulations, community participation and market demand, to ask for environmental initiatives in China, among which, larger sized ﬁrms are more active (Zhang et al., 2008). For the Chinese SMEs, however, the underlying barriers to adoption of cleaner production include the lack of economic incentive policies, lax environmental enforcement, and high initial capital cost (Shi et al., 2008). Therefore, owing to the lack of effective corporate environmental management systems and incentive mechanism, it is difﬁcult to overcome the adverse effects of unreasonable utilization of resources and insufﬁcient adoption of environment-friendly technologies (Zeng et al., 2005). Most of the previous studies show that the scale of enterprises is positively correlated to their environmental management capac- ities as larger sized enterprises can easily get access to resources (Jesus and Junquera, 2003; Zeng et al., 2010a) and external support (Darnall and Edwards, 2006). SMEs, however, exhibit some passive environmental management behavior in dealing with environ- mental laws and regulations, which may be resulted from the lack of effective driving forces (Zeng et al., 2005), that is, the lack of effective pressures or forces that drive ﬁrms to promote environ- mental management. There is, to our knowledge, a paucity of studies in exploring impacts of driving forces of environmental management on the environmental and the economic performance of SMEs (Liu et al., 2010). In this paper, a survey is conducted, aiming to explore how the driving forces (i.e., from the government, society, market and enterprise itself) of environmental management affect environ- mental and economic performances of SMEs of different levels of pollution (i.e., light and high). This study aims to provide answers to the following questions:  How environmental management driving forces affect corpo- rate environmental and economic performances of SMEs?  What is the relation of different pollution levels to environ- mental performance and economic performance of SMEs?  For different pollution levels of SMEs, what is the correlation of environmental performance and economic performance? 2. Previous works 2.1. Driving forces on environmental management Driving forces, pushing enterprises to implement environ- mental management, are divided into two types: internal and external (Montiel and Husted, 2010; Qi et al., 2010). 2.1.1. Internal driving forces Internal driving forces are resulted from company’s internal motivation (enterprise itself), such as internationalization of seeking to enter the international market (King and Lenox, 2001), reputation of the enterprise (Bansal and Hunter, 2003), valuing systems of management (Egri and Herman, 2000), and the corpo- rate environmental responsibility for employees’ health (Roome and Wijen, 2006). These forces work because environmental pollution prevention can provide a better performance to enter- prises (King and Lenox, 2000). Enterprises will actively adopt the strategies of implementing environmental management when gaining competitive advantages (Aragon-Correa et al., 2008); for example, clean production tech- nologies (Zeng et al., 2010c), product re-design, change of production process, improvement of resource utilization (Ramus and Steger, 2000), and reduction of production cost can build up company’s competitive advantages (Sharma, 2000). 2.1.2. external driving forces Driving forces coming from externalities (Delmas, 2002) are very important in promoting environmental management of enterprises (Branzei et al., 2004; Moffat and Auer, 2006). They can be divided into three aspects: the government driving force (Zeng et al., 2003), the market driving force and the social driving force (Kassinis and Vafeas, 2006). Enterprises, barely meeting the requirements of mandatory government environmental regulations, can escape from environ- mental punishment. Thus, it is well acknowledged the importance of government environmental regulations for guiding corporate environmental management. To avoid environmental penalties, ﬁnes and violation costs, enterprises must comply with these environmental regulations. The market driving force includes two aspects: competitors’ and buyers’ requirements (Shrivastava, 1995). For example, enterprises can improve market competitiveness after implementing envi- ronmental management by reducing manufacturing waste (Zeng et al., 2008). The social driving forces including those from public media and certain industrial associations are also important as enterprises’ commitment to eco-responsibility can help them gain social reputation (Hart, 1995). 2.2. Corporate environmental and economic performance The relationship between corporate environmental and economic performances has always been the core issue of envi- ronmental management research (Menguc et al., 2010; Russo and Fouts, 1997). However, previous studies give mixed results. Busi- ness performance can be measured in terms of the gross proﬁt margin, market share, sales per capita, etc. (Henri and Journeault, 2008; Naveh and Marcus, 2005). Porter and van der Linde (1995) addressed that environmental regulations could improve the competitiveness of enterprises; therefore, the environmental and economic performances were positively related as conﬁrmed by other researchers (Hart, 1995; Klassen and Whybark, 1999; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). However, this has faced some challenges. Some research identiﬁed that the relationship between corporate environmental and economic performances was not signiﬁcant, some even with negative correlation because implementing envi- ronmental management needs to invest extra resources, including funds, technologies and human resources, leading to extra costs. Therefore, environmental management may extrude other poten- tial investments and reduce the corporate sustainable competition (Sarkis and Dijkshoorn, 2007; Wagner, 2008). In fact, the relationship between environment management and corporate performance may be more complex. Adoption of cutting-edge technology costs more and good environmental performance can reduce corporate proﬁts, and thus the environ- mental and economic performances could have an inverse relation- ship. However, some studies (Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998; Buysse and Verbeke, 2003) show that improvement in environmental performance is a potential competitive advantage (e.g., new tech- nologies to cost reduction, innovative products, and attracting more in environment-friendly consumers). Therefore, improvement 1428 S.X. Zeng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 19 (2011) 1426e1437 environment management and competitiveness of enterprises are not in conﬂict (Lee et al., 2006; Andersson and Bateman, 2000). Adopting proactive environmental management including environ- mental auditing programs and management systems has been found to be associated with strong ﬁnancial performance (Darnall et al., 2010). Waddock and Smith (2000) conducted a case study with a description of how an internal environmental audit led to improved waste reduction practices, increased plant capacity, and signiﬁcant cost savings. Adopting environmental management systems which exceed legal requirements could decrease enterprises’ toxic emis- sions levels and realize lower capital costs (Feldman et al., 1997; Sharfman and Fernando, 2008). Progressive environmental management also leads to opportunities to work with external environmental stakeholder groups, and to take part in high-proﬁle environmental programs from government (Miles and Covin, 2000). As a result, enlightened environmental management can improve ﬁnancial and reputational competitive advantages (Petrick et al., 1999). Murphy (2002) made a good summary of twenty leading empirical studies on the correlation of environmental/ ﬁnancial performances and found that positive environmental performance is linked with positive ﬁnancial results, indicating that the conventional ‘cost’ view is outdated in some sense. In a long-term perspective, corporate environmental management and competi- tiveness could be a “winewin” relationship (Juan and Enrique, 2007; Porter and van der Linde,1995; Shrivastava,1995; Christmann, 2000). 3. Model development and hypotheses 3.1. A conceptual model According to the literature review, the driving forces for envi- ronmental management of Chinese SME can be categorized into four dimensions: government, market, society, and enterprise. The performance is decomposed into environmental performance and business performance. A conceptual model of driving forces on environmental management performance is developed as shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, the environmental performance is measured in terms of contamination control and contamination prevention. Contamination control includes reducing contamination release, energy consump- tion, and selecting suppliers with good environmental protection records (Lopez-Gamero and Molina-Azor ln, 2009). Contamination prevention is a long-term measure, which includes carrying out ISO 14001, cleaner production activities, staff training, and environmental audit. Economic performance can directly be reﬂected by ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial indices. Financial indices refer to sales, proﬁtability, inventory turnover, and ROE while non-ﬁnancial indices refer to market share, sale region, and the number of customers (Earnhart and Lizal, 2010). As for external and internal driving forces in Fig. 1, the driving force from the government includes government incentives, regu- lations, and assistance. Government incentive is the major moti- vation for SME, for instance, in terms of tax reduction and subsidy, etc. (Zeng et al., 2003). The government can reward environment- friendly SMEs according to China’s Cleaner Production Promotion Law, and SME Promotion Law in 2003, which applies to all regions of China supporting SMEs with tax reduction and subsidy, venture capital and investment guarantees or other ﬁnancial support, and opportunities to the undertake Government’s environmental projects. Government regulations mean that when enterprises violate the law or fail in achieving the standard, the government would compel enterprises to follow by imposing a penalty, even stopping their businesses. Government assistance is deﬁned as assistance in the forms of technologies, information about envi- ronmental protection, project ﬁnance, and other supports for corporate environmental green products and technologies. Market driving forces include two aspects: competitors’ and buyers’ requirements. The driving force of competitors refers to environmental protection practices and the related pressure brought about by competitors of the same industry. Buyers’ requirements are the forces imposed by purchasers or customers. If production of the ﬁnal products (such as food, medicine, textile, paper, etc.) is closer to consumers, businesses may feel more pressure. When an enterprise can improve its reputation, it would be more motivated to adopt environmental management. Society driving forces are composed of many elements: community requirements, environmental associations, and media exposure. Community requirements are made up of suggestions Driving Forces  Performance Government Incentives  Government Regulation  Government Assistance  Community Requirements  Environmental Associations  Media Exposure Competitors  Buyers’ Requirements  Market Expansion  Profitability Improvement  External:  Government External:  Society External:  Market Internal: Enterprise Environmental  Performance Economic  Performance Contamination  Control Contamination  Prevention Financial  Indices  Non-financial  Indices Fig. 1. Conceptual model of driving forces affecting performance of SMEs. S.X. Zeng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 19 (2011) 1426e1437 1429 from the community and complaints about environmental prob- lems. Environmental associations are the social association, calling for protecting the environment, and imposing their requirements on enterprises. Media exposure is the exposure of various media, such as television, broadcasting companies, newspapers and online media. Currently, once a company is exposed by the public media, local governments would be subject to the pressure from the public and the higher-level government may impose severe penalties on the companies. To better achieve the strategic objectives (i.e., proﬁtability and market expansion), enterprises can be motivated to implement environmental management. Financial goals consist of sales, prof- itability, and return on equity (ROE). The expansion of market share and number of customers are the representative indices for market expansion. Because of the close relationship between ﬁnancial promotion and market expansion, the programs or planning for the above aspects will form a combined index for measuring the enterprises’ driving force. 3.2. Hypotheses development To study the driving forces for SMEs’ environmental manage- ment, enterprises are divided into high and light-pollution accord- ing to their contamination levels. High-pollution enterprises are deﬁned as those causing severe contamination to the environment, while the light-pollution ones causing less severe pollution. 3.2.1. Driving forces and environmental performance The relationship between environmental performance and the four driving forces (government, society, market and enterprises) will be discussed below, and hypotheses will be developed accordingly. Increasingly strict regulations of the government are the primary motivation to drive enterprises to improve their environ- mental performance. The mandatory rules cause enterprises participating in voluntary environmental activities in order to achieving standards beyond the requirement of these strict rules (Segerson and Miceli, 1998). In addition, the lower cost for consumers and the government accessing enterprises’ information can induce a greater power to drive enterprises to voluntarily reduce contamination for the sake of their reputation (Segerson and Miceli, 1998). enterprises The adoption of environmental management system for enter- prises is related to the community commitment to the relevant stakeholders (Florida and Davison, 2001). Enterprises would signiﬁcantly reduce toxic emission, which could attract attention of a lot of environmental interest groups (Maxwell and Decker, 2006). Market pressure is one of the factors affecting enterprises’ environmental performance. Some research explain the internal motivation of in implementing environmental from different perspectives, e.g., organizational management structure (Ramus and Steger, 2000), organizational learning (Marcus and Nichols, 1999), values of leadership (Egri and Herman, 2000), and attitudes of managers toward the environment (Cordano and Frieze, 2000; Sharma, 2000). Based on the cost-proﬁt theory of economics, managers make decisions either regarding the relevant costs, risks and beneﬁts, or focusing on enterprises’ competitive advantage, i.e., improving corporate image through proactive environmental strategy, green differentiation strategy to expand market share (Branzei et al., 2004; Chen et al. 2006). From previous studies, it is noted that the force imposed by the government on enterprises is thought to be the most conspicuous driving factor, especially in the forms of incentives and regulations on SMEs. However, the government’s effort on SMEs has led to unsatisfactory results as the driving force of government on SMEs mainly relies on regulations in the recent decade in China. It thus leads to the questions of whether the government’s incentive schemes and regulations would still bring better results and whether the current social pressure, market competition and internal enterprise driving forces could lead to better environ- mental performance. Hence, it is proposed for SMEs at different contamination level that: H1a. Levels of the government driving force positively inﬂuence the environmental performance of SMEs. H1b. Levels of society driving force are positively associated with the environmental performance of SMEs. H1c. Levels of market driving force are positively associated with the environmental performance of SMEs. H1d. Levels of enterprise driving force are positively associated with the environmental performance of SMEs. 3.2.2. Driving forces and economic performance suggest that government Existing literatures regulations, market and social pressure, corporate proactive environmental strategies impel corporate environmental management practices, i.e., adopting new environmental practices to reduce pollution source, more environmentally friendly ways of operation, etc., which can reduce waste disposal costs, and penalty, bringing about effective economic beneﬁts for enterprises (Aragon-Correa et al., 2008; Delmas, 2002; Moffat and Auer, 2006). Internationalization is the key factor for enterprises to introduce environmental management systems widely (Zeng et al., 2003), which indicates that international environmental regulations and consideration for market expansion could model enterprises’ behavior and thus affect their economic performance. Zeng et al. (2003) concluded that the most important driving force for Chinese construction enterprises was “seeking to enter the inter- national construction market”. Green consumption of the market contributes to new cleaner products and contamination reduction. Green preference of the market could make enterprises to win the market and improve economic performance by product differentiation (Cordano et al., 2010). For enterprises, implementation of integrated environmental management can lower the business risk from the environmental perspective, and thus they can be easier to get insurance and commercial loan. Environmental crises also have a negative impact on businesses (Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996), which would be reﬂected from the abnormal negative return in the stock market. In general, the driving force of government has a signiﬁcant effect on SMEs’ economic performance, because the positive ways (such as tax reduction and subsidy) and the negative ways (like penalty and shutdown for reformation) could greatly inﬂuence enterprises’ economic performance. Nevertheless, some managers of SMEs and environment consultants, whom we interviewed, generally accepted that neither government’s incentives and regulations, nor government’s assistance have conspicuous effects on the economic performance of SMEs. Thus, it leads to the ques- tion on whether government’s incentives have enough attraction to SMEs, and the regulations could powerfully stimulate them, and the government’s assistance could also achieve the expected results. The market competition and social pressure, and the enterprise itself (e.g., competition with differentiation, and consideration for lower ﬁnancing costs) may have a signiﬁcant impact on the economic performance. However, there exists inadequate investigation toward the driving forces on the economic performance of SMEs at different contamination levels. Hence, for the SMEs, the following hypotheses are proposed: 1430 S.X. Zeng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 19 (2011) 1426e1437 H2a: Government’s driving forces impact signiﬁcantly on the economic performance of SMEs. H2b: Society driving forces impact signiﬁcantly on the economic performance of SMEs. H2c: Market driving forces impact signiﬁcantly on the economic performance of SMEs. H2d: Enterprise driving forces impact signiﬁcantly on the economic performance of SMEs. 3.2.3. Environmental and economic performance The results of studies on corporate environmental performance and economic performance are controversial. (2007) Klassen and McLaughlin (1996) found that environmental management and economic performance have a positive correla- tion. Montabon et al. revealed that environmental management was positively correlated to economic performance. Proactive environmental management could lead to better perfor- mance (Claver et al., 2007), of which enterprises were more inclined to take proactive environmental management with a precautionary combination of environmental control technology. However, some researchers argue that there lacks a correlation or even exhibits a negative correlation. Sarkis and Dijkshoorn (2007) found that when the environmental performance was improved, the economic performance had not improved signiﬁcantly. Sarkis (2006) revealed that additional investments on the environment in a project at the early stage might be unable to provide better economic perfor- mance within a short period of time. Link and Naveh (2006) addressed that implementation of an environmental management system was unassociated with business performance. In fact, enterprises of different contamination levels will have different costs and beneﬁts resulted from improving the environ- mental performance (Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998; Juan and Enrique, 2007). Hence, it is proposed: H3a: For SMEs with high-pollution level: environmental perfor- mance is positively associated with their economic performance. H3b: For SMEs with light-pollution level: environmental performance is positively associated with their economic performance. H3c: For SMEs of the two pollution levels: high-pollution and light-pollution enterprises, the relationship between environ- mental performance and economic performance is different. 4. Research Methodology 4.1. Measurement 4.1.1. Dependent variable The dependent variable is enterprises’ performance. The enter- prises’ performance is measured by two aspects: environmental and economic performance. Environmental performance consists of short-term contami- nation control measures and long-term contamination preventions. Contamination control is measured by three indices: reduction in contamination release, energy consumption, and selecting suppliers with good environmental protection records. Contami- nation prevention has four components: carrying out ISO 14001 environmental management system, conducting cleaner produc- tion activities, staff training, and environmental auditing. Economic performance comprises ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial indices. The ﬁnancial index is surveyed in a form of sales, proﬁt- ability, inventory turnover, and ROE while the non-ﬁnancial index is measured by market shares, sale region, and the number of customers. 4.1.2. Independent variables Independent variables are the government’s driving forces, society driving forces, market driving forces, and enterprises’ driving forces. Government’s driving forces are divided into three dimensions: incentives, regulations, and government’s assistance. Market driving forces include competitors’ and buyers’ requirements. Society driving forces include community requirements, environ- mental associations, and media exposure. Enterprise driving forces are represented by ﬁve indices: overall planning for sales, overall planning for proﬁtability, overall planning for ROE, overall planning for market share expansion, and overall planning for the increase in the number of customers. 4.1.3. Control variables To avoid the relationship between driving forces and enter- prises’ performance inﬂuenced by total assets, past sales, the number of employees, and ages of SMEs, they are set as control variables. Multiple regression analysis and factor analysis are used to study the relationship. In this study, software programs SPSS 15.0 is used. 4.2. Survey In this paper, classiﬁcation of SMEs is based on the industry- category standard declared by the National Statistical Bureau of China. SMEs are classiﬁed into high-pollution and light-pollution enterprises for contrast and analysis. High-pollution enterprises with waste water or gas or other solid waste pollutants (e.g., sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, coal dust, mineral oils, cyanide, mercury and arsenic) seriously damaging the natural environment and arousing safety hazards. In 2008, China’s State Environmental Protection Administration announced the ﬁrst group of “high pollution, high environmental risk” products directory, involving a total of 141 categories of products, mainly related to pesticides, batteries, dyes, inorganic salt, paints, organic arsenic, etc. However, there still lacks comprehensive, authoritative and accurate criteria for classifying the level of high-pollution enterprises. In fact, high- pollution enterprises are often identiﬁed by the fact of whether a company falls into a high-pollution industry. China’s State Envi- ronmental Protection Administration issued a regulation on envi- ronmental protection veriﬁcation in 2007 and a guidance on Green Security in 2008, which provisionally identiﬁed 13 kinds of high- pollution industries (i.e., metallurgical, chemical, petrochemical, coal, thermal power, building materials, paper making, brewing, pharmaceutical, fermentation, textile, leather and mining), and has imposed strict monitoring on enterprises falling into these high- pollution industries since 2008. Based on the guidance issued by China’s State Environmental Protection Administration in 2008, high-pollution enterprises fall into one of the ﬁve sectors: medicine and chemistry, printing and dyeing or leather-production, metal- lurgical, materials production for building and cement industry, oil reﬁning and cooking industries (Zeng et al., 2010b). While light- pollution enterprises are one of the following ﬁve: agricultural byproduct, weaving and cloth, machinery manufacturing, hard- ware machining, and electronic component industries. The survey was conducted in the Northern China district (including Beijing, Tianjing, and Hebei Province), named as the Bohai Bay economic circle. Northern China is facing serious envi- ronmental problems where there is serious pollution from SMEs. The survey was pre-tested by thirty environmental experts and consultants and revised according to their comments. In 2009, surveys were sent to managers or individuals who worked in the ﬁrm’s manufacturing SMEs and were responsible for S.X. Zeng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 19 (2011) 1426e1437 1431 environmental activities. The manufacturing sector was selected because it produces more air, land, and water pollution than the service sector in China. Respondents were identiﬁed from public database; for instance, the Hebei province population was iden- tiﬁed using data from the directory of SMEs from the Small- and medium-sized Business Administration. From a total of 116,000 manufacturing SMEs in these three provinces, we randomly selected 500 SMEs. Five hundred questionnaires were sent with 137 received. The response rate was 27.4%, which is consistent with previous studies of organizations’ environmental practices (e.g., Christmann, 2000; Darnall et al., 2010). One hundred and four valid questionnaires were used for analysis, including 39 high-pollution SMEs and 65 light-pollution SMEs. Among the three investigating ways of mailing, direct visiting and telephone, the rate of e-mail feedback questionnaire is low. The reasons of the invalid questionnaires are that the characteristics of enterprises (e.g., number of employees or the annual revenues) were beyond the deﬁnition of SMEs, and those export-oriented enterprises with a proportion of export value of more than 20% of their total turnover had been subjected to great inﬂuence due to the ﬁnancial crisis in 2008, and those with incomplete information in the questionnaires. In this study, a ﬁve-point scale is used to assess the enterprises’ response to the driving forces, environmental and economic performances. 5. Results and analysis 5.1. Reliability and validity 5.1.1. Reliability analysis In this paper, Cronbach Alpha coefﬁcient (a coefﬁcient) is used for checking the internal consistency of items, which is a widely accepted reliability test. Reliability refers to the characteristics of the measurement results with consistency and stability. The higher the reliability of measurement, the more stable and reliable measure- ment results will be. However, the acceptable value of Cronbach a coefﬁcient lacks a uniﬁed standard. It is usually considered that the coefﬁcient of reliability falling into the range of 0.6e0.8 is enough. In practice, it is good when the value of consistency coef- ﬁcient is above 0.7 (Peter, 1979). By running the modules of reli- ability analysis in SPSS 15.0, a value of Cronbach a coefﬁcient for every item of driving forces and performance is obtained. Table 1 tabulates the Cronbach a coefﬁcients for measuring each dimen- sion of driving forces and performance. The values of a coefﬁcient in both driving forces and perfor- mance are larger than 0.6, with the exception of the market forces of high-pollution enterprises and contamination control of light- in where the Cronbach a coefﬁcient is pollution enterprises, comparatively low. 5.1.2. Validity analysis As the indicators of driving forces and the performance are based on the existing research results, the content validity of the indicators is satisfactory. In this paper, conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) is employed to test the construct validity. Common factors are calculated by the way of Varimax rotation. Before factor analysis, the relativity among items using methods of KMO sample test and Bartlett sphericity test is used to ﬁnd out whether it is suitable to use factor analysis. The results of tests suggest that it is proper to carry out the CFA. From the correlation matrix of the observable items, “% of variance explained” of the ﬁrst factor, is collected (see Table 2). Both for the high- and light-pollution SMEs, the driving forces of government, market, and enterprise, are able to extract the ﬁrst In performance, factor with a high degree of explanation. Table 1 Reliability analysis of driving forces and performance. Light-pollution enterprisesa High-pollution enterprises Cronbach’s a Driving Forces Government Driving Force 0.655 Market Driving Force 0.529 Society Driving Forceb e Enterprise Driving Force 0.884 Environmental Performance Contamination Control Contamination Prevention Economic Performance Financial Indicesc Non-ﬁnancial Indices 0.389 0.897 0.785 0.675 Cronbach’s a 0.475 0.323 e 0.844 0.499 0.899 0.824 0.624 a Each dimension of Driving Forces, Environmental Performance, and Economic Performance calculates Cronbach’s a coefﬁcient for light and high-pollution enter- prises respectively. b Because of the small scale nature of SMEs and underground occurrence of contamination, choices for the “Environmental Associations” and “Media Exposure” are usually ﬁlled with “None” under the society driving forces. Therefore, these two aspects affect Cronbach’s a coefﬁcient for measuring the society driving forces and the values of CITC (Corrected ItemeTotal Correlation) are less than 0.3. It is clear that there is obvious difference in the values of Cronbach’s a coefﬁcient after the item is deleted. So the items of “Environmental Associations” and “Media Exposure” are eliminated, the social driving forces only include community requirements, which stands for the driving forces of Society. As there is only one indicator left, it does not need reliability testing. c Taking reliability test and principal component analysis into consideration, we can ﬁnd that the CITC for the item “inventory turnover” of ﬁnancial indices is less than 0.3. If the item for measure is removed, the Cronbach’s a coefﬁcient would rise. Therefore, the ﬁnancial performance is measured using the remaining items of Sales, Proﬁtability and ROE. After removal, it shows a much greater internal consistency of the three items. contamination control and contamination prevention, and ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial indices, are also able to ﬁnd a factor with high degree variance explanation. In the following multiple regression analysis, the score of the ﬁrst factor can be regarded as the value of the composite indicator, and then as control variables which are used to analyze the speciﬁc impact of other driving forces on performance. Since there is no “% of variance” of each factor reaching 85% or more, there is no severe violation of multicollinearity among similar indices in any one construct.

Driving forces on environmental performance 5.2.1.1. Relationship between driving forces and contamination con- trol. The number of employees, past sales, total assets and ﬁrm ages are set as the control variables. Multiple regression analysis is used and the dependent variable is contamination control in this part. For the independent variables, the driving forces of government, market, society, and enterprise itself are used respectively; for example, the driving forces of government is focused ﬁrst, that is, the impact of government incentives, government regulations and government assistance on contamination control. The integrated factor score of the other three driving forces then serves as the control variable. By controlling the three driving forces, the rela- tionship between contamination control and the government driving forces is analyzed. Similarly, other driving forces are analyzed. The results are shown in Table 3. For different pollution levels of SMEs, the effects of government and market driving forces on contamination control are different. For high-pollution enterprises, government incentives have obvious effects. But for the light-pollution enterprises, government assistances play a more important role. Government regulations to enterprises of the two contamination levels have no discernible effect. For high-pollution enterprises, competitors of the market driving force have evidential inﬂuence. While for the light- pollution enterprises, buyers’ requirements can drive enterprises to improve the levels of contamination control. For the two types of SMEs, social driving forces have positive inﬂuences on enhancement of contamination control, while enterprises’ driving forces have no signiﬁcant effects in improving the contamination control. 5.2.1.2. Relationship between driving forces and contamination pre- vention. From the regression results of high-pollution enterprises (see Table 4), only the driving force of the market has a signiﬁcantly positive impact on SMEs in upgrading the level of pollution prevention at p < 0.05 level. However, government driving forces, social driving forces and enterprise driving forces do not show signiﬁcantly positive roles. As for the government driving forces, only the government incentive is signiﬁcant at a level of 0.10. Regression results of light-pollution enterprises also show that only the market driving force has a signiﬁcantly positive inﬂuence on the environment performance in contamination prevention. Further, the inﬂuence of the market driving force for the two types of SMEs mainly comes from competitors’ pressure instead of buyers’ requirements. As shown in Tables 3 and 4, with an increasing awareness of environmental protection, social driving forces have become stronger for SMEs, and the government can play a signiﬁcant role, and the effect of market is stronger. Whether for light- or high- pollution SMEs, government, market and society are three impor- tant driving forces, which support hypotheses 1a, 1b, and 1c. It is clear that the contamination control, traditionally under the governmental regulations, is transiting to be driven by the government, market and community. However, enterprises’ driving forces for SMEs at different pollution levels do not motivate SMEs to Table 3 Results of regression analyses: effects of driving forces on contamination control.

The dependent variable of the model Ma1 and Ma2 is Contamination Control (CC). The independent variables, we focused on, are the government driving forces. Then, the impact of government incentives, government regulations and government assistance on contamination control is studied. The ﬁrst factor of the other three driving forces was treated as the control variable. Similarly, for model Mb1 and Mb2, the market driving forces are treated as the independent variables. Meanwhile, the impact of competitors’ and buyers’ requirements on contamination control is explored. For the model Mc1 and Mc2, the independent variable is the enterprise driving force. Then, the inﬂuences are analyzed respectively for the strength of planning for Sales, Proﬁtability, ROE, market share and number of customers on contamination control. The integrated factor score of the other three driving forces serves as the control variables. S.X.

Thus, hypothesis 1d is not supported. For the short-term contamination control, inﬂuence of community requirements for high-pollution and light-pollution enterprises is almost the same, while there is a difference between the market and government driving forces. these SMEs. Therefore, Owing to the low degree of attention to light-pollution enter- prises, competitors give little effect on the environmental protec- tion of competitors’ pressure on contamination control of light-pollution enterprises is low. On the contrary, high-pollution enterprises are strictly supervised by the environmental protection departments, which lead to high level of environmental protection in the industry. To survive, high- pollution enterprises need to practice contamination control pro- actively under the high competitors’ pressure. Considering the driving force of government, most SMEs are township-run enterprises, and there exist difﬁculties in supervision and create problems of local protectionism. So high-pollution enterprises are motivated to control and prevent contamination by the government incentives. Nevertheless, the government super- vision cannot give them sufﬁcient pressure. Considering light- pollution enterprises, they do not make much pollution and the impacts of government incentives and regulations for them are very low, while government assistances can promote pollution control and prevention. Government incentives can bring better results than government regulations on environmental manage- ment of SMEs for the high-pollution enterprises. However, for light- pollution enterprises, government incentives and regulations have no better effect than the government assistance. For the long-term pollution prevention, pressure from competitors in the market has a certain degree of inﬂuence on light-pollution enterprises in enhancing contamination prevention. However, competitors of light-pollution enterprises are not enthusiastic about the overall industrial environment. Therefore, in-depth studies on how to protect the environment for light- pollution enterprises are needed in the future. For the high- pollution enterprises, government incentives and competition continue to be the two most critical elements affecting pollution prevention. 5.2.2. Driving force on economic performance 5.2.2.1. Relationship between driving forces and ﬁnancial indices. From the regression results of high-pollution enterprises (see Table 5), the driving force within enterprises has a signiﬁcant effect on ﬁnancial indices. While the pressure from the government, market and society has little impact on the ﬁnancial indices. As shown in the regression results of light-pollution enterprises, the driving forces from within enterprises also exert a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the achievement of ﬁnancial targets while the government, market and social pressure do not have signiﬁcant impacts. 5.2.2.2. Relationship between driving forces and non-ﬁnancial indi- ces. From the regression results of high-pollution enterprises, the driving forces within enterprises and from the society and market have signiﬁcant impacts on the improvement of enterprises’ non- ﬁnancial indices. However, the impact of the community require- ments is signiﬁcantly negative. The market driving forces also come from the competitors. From the regression results of light-pollution enterprises, adjusted R2 and F test are not signiﬁcant; therefore, all the driving forces have no signiﬁcant effect on the non-ﬁnancial indices for light-pollution enterprises (see Table 5). Table 5 Results of regression analyses: effects of driving forces on economic performance.

It is used to think that government incentives and regulations may have great impact on the economical performance of enter- prises. However as shown in this study, the government driving forces for these two types of SMEs are not statistically signiﬁcant, which concurs with the result of the interview to SMEs and envi- ronment consultants. Therefore, hypothesis 2a is not supported; that is, the government driving forces do not have signiﬁcant impact on the economic performance of SMEs. For high-pollution enter- prises, the market driving forces from competitors contribute to improvement in ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial indices (Hypothesis 2c is supported). Meanwhile, community requirements can increase the pressure on enterprises’ expansion, and produce a negative effect on the economic performance (Hypotheses 2b and 2d are partially supported). 5.2.3. Correlation of environment performance and economic performance It is generally accepted that the correlation is strong when the absolute value of correlation coefﬁcient reaches 0.8 or more; the correlation is a mediocre when it ranges from 0.5 to 0.8; a low correlation when it is from 0.3 to 0.5 and a weak correlation when it is from 0 to 0.3. By observing the correlation coefﬁcients between environmental performance indices and economic performance indices, it can be seen that for light-pollution enterprises, there is a medium correlation between contamination control and ﬁnancial indices (see Table 6). While, there is a low correlation between ﬁnancial indices and pollution prevention for high-pollution enterprises. When there is less external pressure, the aim of light-pollution enterprises to implement contamination control is to enhance the proﬁtability and operational ability. There is a positive correlation between the contamination control and the ﬁnancial indices. While for high-pollution enterprises, contamination prevention can reduce the violation costs, which will create conditions for a steady and continuous development. There is a certain level of correlation between contamination prevention and ﬁnancial indices. Hypoth- esis 3c (for SMEs of the two pollution levels of SMEs, high-pollution enterprises and light-pollution enterprises, the relationship between environmental performance and economic performance is different) is supported. There are medium correlations between the environmental performance and the economic performance of SMEs. Further, the correlation mainly appears between environ- mental performance and ﬁnancial indices, instead of correlations between environmental performance and non-ﬁnancial indices (Hypothesis 3a, 3b are partially supported). 6. Discussion and concluding remarks that have implemented little environmental management to improve. For social driving forces, community requirements of residents for environmental pollution have great inﬂuence on contamination control for SMEs. However, the impacts of envi- ronmental organizations and media attention on environmental performance for large enterprise are strong, but which are not obvious for SMEs. As for the government driving forces, the effect of the government incentives for contamination control or prevention is greater than that of the government supervision. For enterprise driving forces, that is, the enterprises’ own requests have not brought signiﬁcant improvement on environmental performance. Viewing from the economic performance, there is no doubt that enterprises’ driving forces of the high-pollution SMEs have a signiﬁcant effect on both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial indices. In addition, competitors’ pressures also play an important role in the improvement of economic performance. Upgrading the concept of industry-wide environmental protection can bring up the level of overall proﬁtability and overall market expansion while the community requirements of environment for high-pollution enterprise generate some obstacles for market expansion. Envi- ronmental performance and economic performance of high- pollution enterprises have a certain degree of positive correlation. The practical implications for high-pollution SMEs to enhance environmental management level are: First, the government needs to strengthen the role of govern- ment incentives to encourage enterprises to participate in the implementation of environmental management. The govern- ment tends to pay more attention in supervising the larger sized enterprises, but lacks monitoring the large number of SMEs. Therefore, only a few extreme SMEs whose production has caused serious environmental accidents would be regulated. Therefore, the government should devise special environmental management measures for those high-pollution SMEs, and give sufﬁcient ﬁnancial support (e.g., tax breaks, subsidies) and other measures to motivate them to implement environmental management. Second, it needs to enhance the status of industrial association and take measures to come up with consensus on environment issues within the industry and implement industrial self- discipline. Third, it needs to pay better respect to buyers’ opinions. Many overseas customers consider the environmental factor as an important selection criterion in selecting suppliers from China, which however has not been paid sufﬁcient attention by local Chinese buyers and customers. The government should encourage green purchasing through some tangible (economic ways) and intangible (such as media campaigns) incentives. Market driving forces play an important role in improving performance of contamination control and prevention, in which pressure from competitors is particularly signiﬁcant. It is obvious that raising the overall level of environmental management in the whole industry has a very big positive effect on driving the SMEs The society, market and government play an important role in environmental performance for light-pollution SMEs. Community requirements promote contamination control. Buyers’ demands in the market can improve contamination control, which manifests 1436 S.X. Zeng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 19 (2011) 1426e1437 short-term effects of downstream enterprises for SMEs environ- mental management, while competitors can upgrade the level of contamination prevention, a long-term impact of environmental management. Government aids could improve the performance of contamination control because the light-pollution enterprises would try to avoid legal penalties and enjoy preferential policies of the government. Therefore, technology, information, and ﬁnancing assistance from the government can be often able to achieve better contamination control. Enterprises’ driving forces are not directly related to the envi- ronmental performance, which means contamination pollution prevention and control cannot achieve the business development goals. For economic performance, only the enterprises’ driving forces have some positive correlation with the ﬁnancial indices. However, the government, market and social driving forces on economic performance are not signiﬁcant. Environmental performance and economic performance of light-pollution enterprises also have a certain degree of positive correlation. Though the light-pollution enterprises do not impose much burden on the environment, their activities should not also be overlooked because of their weak awareness of environmental protection. The practical implications for light-pollution enter- prises to enhance environmental management level are: First, the government needs to strengthen the role of govern- ment assistance. It may be one of the most effective ways for light-pollution enterprises because most of them are out of the scope of governmental incentive plans and supervision. The Government should provide more channels for supporting environmental protection, such as promotion of new environ- mental technologies, introduction of cleaner production and implementation of environmental management system, infor- mation channels of environmental protection facilities purchasing, loans for environmental management, etc. These assistances will not consume much money from the govern- ment, but can effectively enhance the level of environmental control and prevention for light-pollution SMEs through long- term support of technical, information, ﬁnancial services. Second, it needs to raise the environmental awareness. Managers of light-pollution SMEs may not pay much attention to environmental management of their business. As the results indicators have signiﬁcantly positive shown, correlations with pollution prevention for light-pollution indicating that though the implementation of enterprises, pollution prevention (e.g., waste water re-use, dust recycling, and reducing energy consumption) requires some resource input, it can however proﬁt from positive economic beneﬁts. the ﬁnancial As this study is based on the investigation of SMEs in the region of Northern China, validation of studies from other areas is required. In addition, from the statistical analysis, it is found that the control variables such as ﬁrm ages and others also provide signiﬁcant impact on environmental performance and economic performance for SMEs; therefore, the mechanism of these factors need further empirical research.
