British Journal of Industrial Relations 41:2 June 2003 0007–1080 pp. 291–314 Human Resource Management and Corporate Performance in the UK David E. Guest, Jonathan Michie, Neil Conway and Maura Sheehan Abstract The relationship between HRM and performance was explored in 366 UK com- panies using objective and subjective performance measures and cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Using objective measures of performance, greater use of HRM is associated with lower labour turnover and higher proﬁt per employee but not higher productivity. After controlling for previous years’ performance, the association ceases to be signiﬁcant. Using subjective performance estimates, there is a strong association between HRM and both productivity and ﬁnancial performance. The study therefore conﬁrms the association between HRM and performance but fails to show that HRM causes higher performance. 1. Introduction A major challenge for organizations in the future seems likely to be an ever more urgent search for competitive advantage. It is increasingly argued that the  organizations  best  able  to  meet  this  challenge  will  be  those  that  can acquire and utilize valuable, scarce and inimitable resources (Barney 1995). Human resources can fall into this category, it is argued, particularly if they are effectively deployed through appropriate human resource practices and the management of organizational culture (Barney and Wright 1998). One of the key tasks for organizations will therefore be the effective management of human resources. This presents a challenge, both for organizations and for nations such as the UK, as ﬁrms seek to compete in world markets and search for  increased  productivity  by  encouraging  the  spread  of high-performance workplaces. Additional challenges to the future management of people at work arise from  the  growing  expectations  of an  increasingly  well-educated  workforce David Guest is at the Management Centre, King’s College, London.

To attract and retain key workers, it  will be essential to present  and  apply  the  kind  of human  resource  policies  and  practices  that appeal to such workers. By implication, organizations may ﬁnd that they need to ensure the involvement and commitment of workers as part of the route to high performance. The research reported in this paper explores the relation between human resource management (HRM) and corporate performance in a cross-section of UK ﬁrms. A feature of the study is a comparison of various objective and subjective  outcome  measures. The  paper  starts  by  reviewing  the  relevant  literature before describing the methods adopted and the core ﬁndings. The results suggest that, while there appears to be an association between greater use  of human  resource  practices  and  some  measures  of corporate  perfor- mance, there is no convincing evidence that use of HR practices is associated with a change in performance. 2. Review of the literature There is a growing body of evidence showing an association between human resource management and corporate performance (see e.g. Appelbaum et al. 2000; Arthur 1994; Batt 2002; Becker and Gerhart 1996; Becker and Huselid 1998; Guthrie 2001; Huselid 1995; Ichniowski et al. 1997; MacDufﬁe 1995). Most  of the  published  research  supporting  this  association  is  American. Despite an extensive UK literature on the nature of HRM — on its growth, its link to strategy, its limitations, its biases and the extent and problems of application  (see  e.g. Legge  1995; Sparrow  and  Marchington  1999; Storey 2001)  —  there  are  still  relatively  few  published  UK  company-level  studies exploring the relation between HRM and organizational performance. Nev- ertheless, if we look at research reports, the pattern of available evidence is similar to the that of the USA in showing some association between HRM and performance (see e.g. Conyon and Read 1999; Patterson et al. 1997; Peccei et al. 2002; Thompson 1998; West 2002). However, each of these studies had a relatively small, sometimes sector-speciﬁc, sample, and the need remains for a comprehensive study that can determine whether the kind of ﬁndings appar- ently consistently reported in the USA can be replicated in the UK. The case for an association between HRM and performance is based on two linked arguments. The ﬁrst, noted above, is that the effective deployment of human resources offers one of the most powerful bases for competitive advantage (Barney 1995). The second argument is that effective deployment of human resources depends on the application of a distinctive combination of practices, sometimes described as bundles of practices (MacDufﬁe 1995) or as HRM systems (Becker and Huselid 1998). The nature of this distinc- tive combination continues to be a matter of debate. Some of the research has attempted to categorize HR practices in terms of a ‘high performance work  system’ (e.g. Appelbaum  et  al. 2000), while  others  have  described  a system of ‘high-commitment management’ (Arthur 1994; Pfeffer 1998; Wood © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2003. Human Resource Management and Performance 293 and de Menezes 1998) or ‘high-involvement management’ (Guthrie 2001). In other words, once the general case for HRM has been made, there is a further argument about the form of HRM that is likely to be most effective. However, it is worth noting that positive results appear to be reported irrespective of the deﬁnition, and therefore the precise combination of practices, utilized by researchers. Bundles  and  human  resource  systems  focus  on  ‘internal  ﬁt’ (Becker  and Huselid 1998; Guest 1997; Venkatraman 1989), or the use of a consistent set of HR practices. The utility of this emphasis has been challenged by those who argue that performance is more likely to be enhanced by achieving ‘exter- nal  ﬁt’, whereby  the  external  environment  will  help  to  shape  the  business strategy, which in turn will determine the appropriate form of HRM (see e.g. Wright  and  McMahan  1992). There  is  a  plausible  case  that  HRM  will  be more effective if it ﬁts the business strategy of the ﬁrm. A key implication of this focus on ‘external ﬁt’ is that a distinctive form of HRM, however it is characterized, will  not  be  equally  effective  in  organizations  with  different business strategies. Despite this, reviews of the evidence (Becker and Gerhart 1996; Becker  and  Huselid  1998)  acknowledge  that  from  the  American research there appears to be stronger support for the role of internal rather than external ﬁt, and in this paper the focus will be primarily on internal ﬁt. One of the trends in the structure of employment in recent decades that may continue in the future is the shift from manufacturing to services. If this is the case, then it is important to show that the association between human resource management and performance applies across both sectors. As Batt (2002) notes, much of the earlier published work in the USA was conducted in  the  manufacturing  sector  (see  e.g. Arthur  1994; Ichniowski  et  al. 1997; MacDufﬁe 1995; Appelbaum et al. 2000; Youndt et al. 1996). This has been only  partly  balanced  by  service-sector  studies  such  as  those  reported  by Delery and Doty (1996) and more recently by Batt herself (2002), as well as by cross-sector studies (Huselid 1995; Delaney and Huselid 1996; Becker and Huselid  1998; and  Capelli  and  Neumark  2001). Despite  this  element  of neglect, Hitt et al. (2001) argue that it is in some parts of the service sector, such as professional service ﬁrms, that ‘intangible’ human resources might be expected to play a key role, while research by Peccei and Rosenthal (2001) highlights an association between human resource practices and positive cus- tomer-oriented behaviour in stores. This reinforces the case for exploring the role  of HRM  in  the  service  sector, where  the  great  majority  of people  are employed, and for a systematic comparison of the two main sectors in the UK using the same research methods. In the literature on HRM and corporate performance, the concept of per- formance has been addressed in a variety of ways. The most obvious measure is some indicator of ﬁnancial performance, and measures used include return on  investment  and  Tobin’s  Q  (ﬁrm  market  value/book  value: see  Huselid 1995). However, it can be argued that ﬁnancial performance lies at the distant end  of the  causal  chain, and  that  outcome  measures  more  closely  linked  to HRM might be more appropriate. This is reﬂected in some of the other © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2003. 294 British Journal of Industrial Relations measures  that  have  been  reported  in  the  literature, ranging  from  labour turnover to aspects of productivity such as scrap rates and sales per employee. Ideally, we need to use a range of proximal and distal measures and examine how the human resource system relates to each. A further issue is the role and value of subjective and objective indicators (Guthrie 2001). While there are clear attractions in objective measures, the accountancy protocols on which ﬁnancial indicators are based have recently come under critical scrutiny in the context of a number of corporate scan- dals. Furthermore, managers are likely to act on the basis of their subjective perceptions  of ﬁrm  performance, often  in  relation  to  the  performance  of competitors, rather  than  solely  in  the  light  of objective  performance. In  workplace-level studies the scope to use objective indicators, particularly in relation to ﬁnancial outcomes, is severely limited. Research to date has used both objective and subjective indicators, and a case can be made for both. What we need to know therefore is whether the results are similar irrespective of which measure is used. A ﬁnal issue that needs to be addressed is the question of what the research seeks to explain. Much of the published research has shown an association between HRM and performance, either at the same point in time or over time. This  demonstration  of an  association  is  an  important  step  in  advancing research but leaves uncertainties about cause and effect. A second and rather different question seeks more explicitly to determine whether HRM causes a change in performance. Ideally, this requires measurement of both HRM and performance over time and an opportunity to control for previous practices and  performance. This  is  likely  to  be  highly  problematic  with  respect  to HRM, whether considered at a strategic or an operational level. For example, for  each  practice  we  may  need  to  take  account  not  only  of whether  it  is applied, but of any change in form, coverage and frequency of use. It may therefore be more realistic to focus on performance where measures over time tend to be more consistent. However even this approach is not without its problems, since, if we  do  not  know  when  HR  practices  (or  systems)  were introduced or signiﬁcantly amended, we cannot determine whether they have already had an effect which would be apparent in the test of association but not in the test of change. The gains from HRM may already have accrued, so no further change will be recorded. For this reason, there are beneﬁts in exploring both the associational and the causal relationship while collecting performance data over a period of time. This is the approach adopted in this study, using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Several points that emerge from this review shape the focus of the study presented in this paper. The ﬁrst is that a large majority of published studies ﬁnd an association between HR practices and ﬁrm performance, regardless of whether  they  are  cross-sectional  or  longitudinal, whether  conducted  at establishment or company level, whether based on strong performance data or subjective estimates, whatever sector they are based on, whatever opera- tional deﬁnition of HRM is used and wherever they are conducted. The study by  Capelli  and  Neumark  (2001)  is  probably  the  most  notable  exception, © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2003. Human Resource Management and Performance 295 although in the UK Wood and de Menezes (1998) also failed to ﬁnd consist- ent associations between HRM and performance. Despite the positive thrust of most published empirical ﬁndings, Wood (1999) among others has noted that  the  quality  of the  research  base  supporting  the  relationship  between HRM and performance is relatively weak, even in the USA. Given the pos- sibility that institutional and market constraints in Europe lead to different outcomes (Pauuwe 1996), research exploring the association between HRM and performance in countries like the UK is urgently needed. Furthermore, although  research  has  been  conducted  in  both  manufacturing  and  service sectors, the potentially key role of human resources in the service sector, and the  importance  of the  larger  and  rather  more  disparate  service  sector  for employment in the future, point to the need for further cross-sector research. More generally, questions remain about the measurement of both HRM and performance, and about the weight and relevance of tests of association and causation. It is in this context, and recognizing the potential implications for theory, research and national policy on productivity and related issues asso- ciated with the future of work, that further research was undertaken in the UK on the relationship between HRM and performance. 3. The research framework The broad aims of the study were: to explore the relationship between the use of human resource management and a range of performance measures in a sample of UK organizations; to compare the results based on subjective and objective indicators of performance; and to compare results obtained in the manufacturing and service sectors. On this basis, we explore the follow- ing hypotheses. • Hypothesis  1a: There  will  be  an  association  between  greater  use  of HR • Hypothesis  1b: There  will  be  an  association  between  greater  use  of • Hypothesis  1c: There  will  be  an  association  between  greater  use  of HR HR practices and higher labour productivity. practices and lower labour turnover. practices and higher proﬁtability. We have noted that research to date has been based on both objective and subjective indicators of performance, and that there is some evidence from research by Guthrie (2001), based on a rather different kind of analysis by Machin  and  Stewart  (1996), that  subjective  data  may  be  as  valid  as  more objective measures. On this basis, we add a further hypothesis. • Hypothesis 2: The direct relationship between HRM and performance out- comes will be signiﬁcant when both objective and subjective measures of performance are used. We have noted that one of the aims of the research is to compare results for manufacturing  and  service-sector  companies, bearing  in  mind  the  growing © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2003. 296 British Journal of Industrial Relations importance  of the  service  sector  in  the  context  of the  future  of work. However, since  there  is  no  basis  on  which  to  expect  systematic  differences between the sectors, we offer no speciﬁc hypothesis about this comparison. 4. Research methods and data collection The Research Strategy Data were collected through structured questionnaires using telephone inter- views. The decision to use telephone interviews was based on evidence from previous UK research suggesting that senior directors were increasingly reluc- tant  to  complete  written  questionnaires  and  that  a  low  response  rate  was therefore likely. There is no evidence that telephone interviews result in dif- ferent responses from face-to-face interviews. While it restricts the ﬂexibility of the questions, since response categories have to be read out over the tele- phone, it has the advantage over questionnaires of allowing for clariﬁcation of responses and increasing the likelihood that the appropriate person will answer the questions. The interviews with the head of HR, or the most senior person  responsible  for  HR, covered  HR  practices; aspects  of HR  strategy and questions concerning effectiveness of HR practices; employee responses; and subjective assessments of performance. Independent data on employee numbers, sales  and  ﬁnancial  performance  were  obtained  from  Dun  and  Bradstreet. The interviews were conducted in mid-1999 and were carried out on behalf of the research team by TNS Ltd. Information on ﬁnancial performance was collected  for  the  years  from  1996–97  to  2000–01. Much  of the  research reported to date on HRM and performance has been based on cross-sectional data. In this study we adopted two methods to ensure that the data were lon- gitudinal. The ﬁrst was to analyse the information on HR practices in 1999 in relation to independent data on labour productivity and proﬁtability for 2000–01. By ensuring that the performance measures are collected after the HR  measures, we  can  partially  address  the  potential  problem  of reverse causality and present a convincing test of association. The second method was to take account of prior performance by controlling for average perfor- mance in the three previous years, using the average to limit the impact of idiosyncratic single-year changes. This provides a test of whether HR prac- tices are associated with any change in performance. The further attraction of this approach is that it takes into account the possibility that prior ﬁnan- cial performance may explain the adoption of HR practices. Set against this, there is the risk, noted above, that companies that have already seen the ben- eﬁts  of HR  practices  and  are  long-term  high  performers  may  not  improve their performance any further over a year. This implies that we should con- sider  both  methods  set  out  here, recognizing  that  the  analysis  of the  rela- tionship  between  HR  practices  in  1999  and  performance  in  2000  seeks  to explore the presence of an association between HRM and performance, while © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2003. Human Resource Management and Performance 297 the addition of controls for prior performance seeks to test for the impact of HR practices on change in performance. The Sample The sample was drawn from the lists provided by Dun and Bradstreet of UK- based companies employing more than 50 people. Interviews were completed with  610  managers  responsible  for  HR  (hereafter  described  as  ‘HR  man- agers’, although  not  all  were  HR  specialists). Despite  the  source  of the sample, we were able to collect full ﬁnancial information from Dun and Brad- street on only 366 of the 610 ﬁrms for which we have data on HR practices.1 The sample of 610 ﬁrms included 60 per cent in manufacturing and 40 per cent in services according to the SIC classiﬁcation. This indicates that man- ufacturing was heavily over-represented. Indeed, some service-sector organi- zations, including  those  in  ﬁnancial  services, were  notably  less  enthusiastic about  being  interviewed. Fifty  per  cent  of the  companies  had  a  workforce  of between 50 and 200, 31 per cent between 201 and 1000, and 9 per cent more than 1000. Only 52 per cent were HR specialists; the remainder, pre- dominantly  in  smaller  organizations, had  someone  with  a  title  such  as ‘company  director’, ‘payroll  manager’ or  ‘general  manager  responsible  for HR issues’. Fifty-one per cent of the respondents were women and 49 per cent were men. Thirty-four per cent recognized a trade union, although 42 per  cent  of these  estimate  that  less  than  half the  workforce  belongs  to  a  union. The 366 ﬁrms for which independent performance data were available differed signiﬁcantly from the full sample of 610 in three respects: they were likely (i) to be somewhat smaller, (ii) to be in manufacturing rather than ser- vices and (iii) not to be multinationals. The Measures (a) Measures of HR Practices Human resource management was measured through 48 items in the inter- view schedule for HR managers. These are outlined in Box 1. The 48 items were  drawn  from  the  existing  literature  (see  e.g. Becker  and  Gerhart  1996; Dyer and Reeves 1995; Foulkes 1980; Guest and Hoque 1994; Huselid 1995; Pfeffer 1994, 1998; Wood and Albanese 1995), rather than from a speciﬁc a priori deﬁnition of HRM, although there was some emphasis on what have been described as ‘high-commitment’ (Wood and De Menezes 1998) or high- performance (Appelbaum et al. 2000) practices. They covered nine main areas of HRM: recruitment  and  selection; training  and  development; appraisal; ﬁnancial ﬂexibility; job design; two-way communication; employment secu- rity  and  the  internal  labour  market; single  status  and  harmonization; and quality. The items were a mix of estimates of the proportion of the work- force that experienced a particular practice and some dichotomous variables where proportions made no sense. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2003. 298 British Journal of Industrial Relations Items included in the Measure of Human Resource Practices BOX 1 Note: Unless indicated otherwise all items were assessed on a scale where respondents were asked to estimate the proportion of the workforce that experienced the particular practice. 1.

Most models  underlying  HRM  suggest  that  HR  practices  should  be  widely  dis- persed within the organization (for an exception see Wright and Snell 1998). We  therefore  adopted  a  demanding  cut-off point  whereby  the  item  was counted if it applied to 90 per cent or more of the workforce. Within each  of the nine HR practices, the average number of speciﬁc items applying to more than 90 per cent of the workforce was then counted. For dichotomous items, the score was computed as a straight count of the number of items that applied to the whole workforce. The scores within each of the nine HR practices  approximated  to  a  normal  distribution. Scores  were  standardized within the nine HR practices since the number of items describing each of the practices varied. Initial  factor  analysis  of these  nine  aggregate  HR  practices  revealed  no coherent factors or what might be described as ‘bundles’ of practices. There- fore, in line with the argument of Becker and Huselid (1998) about the need to measure the overall human resource system, a measure was used based on the combined mean scores across the nine practices. (b) Measures of organizational performance Various estimates of performance were obtained within the interviews. These included  employment  relations  items  such  as  labour  turnover, absence  and industrial  conﬂict. Estimates  of labour  productivity  and  ﬁnancial  perfor- mance  were  also  obtained  using  a  format  similar  to  that  in  the  Workplace Employee Relations Survey (Cully et al. 1999), whereby performance is com- pared against the average for the industry on a ﬁve-point scale from ‘a lot below average’ (1) through ‘about average’ (3) to ‘a lot better than average’ (5).2 Speciﬁc ﬁgures on labour turnover for the previous year were obtained. These were coded as follows: 0–4.9 per cent (0); 5–14.9 per cent (1); 15–50 per cent (2); >50.1 per cent (3). Independent  ﬁnancial  data  were  collected  from  Dun  and  Bradstreet. Labour productivity was measured by the value of sales per employee, and ﬁnancial performance was measured by the company’s proﬁt per employee.3 The  measure  of sales  per  employee  has  been  quite  extensively  used  as  an  indicator of labour productivity. The use of proﬁt per employee to measure proﬁtability reﬂects a desire to use a measure that is related in some way to employees in the organization. Other potential measures such as Tobin’s Q and return on investment were not readily calculated on the basis of the infor- mation we were able to obtain from Dun and Bradstreet. (c) Control variables Information  was  collected  on  UK  company  workforce  size  from  Dun  and Bradstreet. Sectors (services = 1, manufacturing = 0), trade union member- ship  (membership  density  >25  per  cent  = 1, else  = 0), and  whether  the  organization  was  part  of a  multinational  (yes  = 1, no  = 0)  were  identiﬁed  from  interview  responses. Information  was  also  collected  on  aspects  of © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2003. 302 British Journal of Industrial Relations employment relations, including the presence of a consultative committee, a staff association and whether there was a single union deal (yes = 1, no = 0). These were intended to provide some indication of employment relations for- malization. Finally, information  was  collected  on  whether  the  respondent held an HR post (yes = 1, no = 0), and the perceived importance of the overall HR policy in terms of controlling labour costs (vital = 5, not very important = 1), the latter of which serves as a crude proxy for a cost-based HR strat- egy.

Two  points  are  worth  noting  from  Table  1. With  respect  to  employment relations, 24 per cent of ﬁrms have a union density of 25 per cent or more, 33 per cent have a consultative committee, and 13 per cent have a single union deal. These variables tend not to be strongly associated with any of the out- comes, except for a weak negative association with the measure of produc- tivity, namely sales per employee. Second, there is a relatively low correlation of 0.33 between the objective measure of proﬁt per employee between 1997 and 1999 and the subjective assessment of comparative proﬁt in 1999. Even more starkly, the correlation between the objective measure of productivity between  1997  and  1999, namely  sales  per  employee, and  the  comparative assessment of productivity is only 0.06. It is tempting to suggest that these results question the validity of the subjective assessments. However, it is pos- sible that they are valid accounts of comparative performance and that we are not comparing like with like. The Association between HRM and ‘Objective’ Indicators of Performance Hypothesis 1 proposed a relationship between greater use of HR and lower labour turnover, higher labour productivity and higher proﬁt per employee. Results for the test of the direct link between these variables are shown in Table 2. It should be noted that labour turnover is based on reports from the HR  managers, while  productivity  and  proﬁtability  are  based  on  Dun  and Bradstreet data. The results show that there is a signiﬁcant association between greater use of HR  practices  and  lower  reported  levels  of labour  turnover  (beta -0.14; p < 0.01). When the association between HRM and labour turnover is exam- ined by sector, the results remain signiﬁcant in manufacturing (beta -0.18; p < 0.01)  but  not  in  services  (beta  -0.10, n.s.). We  tested  for  the  interac- tion  effect  between  sector  and  HR  practices, entering  the  interaction  after  HR  practices, but  the  results  showed  no  signiﬁcant  interaction  (beta 0.05, n.s.). The results show no signiﬁcant association between HR practices and pro- ductivity  (beta  0.05, n.s.). However, productivity  is  signiﬁcantly  associated with sector and appears to be higher in the service sector (beta 0.17; p < 0.05). An  analysis  within  each  sector  shows  that  there  is  no  association  between HRM and productivity in either sector (beta 0.00; n.s. in manufacturing and beta 0.13, n.s. in services). In contrast to productivity — and therefore somewhat unexpectedly, since it is the more distal measure — Table 2 indicates that there is a signiﬁcant association  between  HRM  and  proﬁt  per  employee  (beta  0.11; p < 0.05). Although there is no signiﬁcant effect for sector in the initial regression analy- sis, a  more  detailed  sector-by-sector  analysis  indicates  that  the  association between  HRM  and  ﬁnancial  performance  is  stronger  in  manufacturing  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2003.   © B l a c k w e l l   P u b   i l i s h n g L t d / L o n d o n   S c h o o l   o f E c o n o m i c s   2 0 0 3 .

This is conﬁrmed when we interact HR practices  and  sector  (beta  -0.12; p < 0.05). In  other  words, it  appears  that greater use of HR practices has a positive link to proﬁt per employee in manufacturing but little or no association in the service sector. We tested the impact of HRM on change in productivity and proﬁtability between  1999  and  2000, controlling  for  the  average  performance  over  the years from 1997 to 1999.5 It was not possible to explore labour turnover in this  way, since  data  were  available  only  for  1999. The  results  are  shown  in Table 3. The data on productivity continue to show no association with greater use of HRM for the sample as a whole (beta -01, n.s.) or for the sub-samples of manufacturing (beta -0.03, n.s.) or service-sector ﬁrms (beta 0.02, n.s.). Simi- larly, once controls for previous proﬁtability are included, there is no asso- ciation between HRM and proﬁtability for the sample as a whole (beta 0.02, n.s.) or for the manufacturing (beta 0.08, n.s.) and service (-0.10, n.s.) sectors. In summary, there is partial support for Hypotheses 1a and 1c based on the test of association. There is no support for Hypothesis 1b proposing an association between HRM and productivity. Greater use of HR practices is associated with lower labour turnover on a cross-sectional analysis. Greater use of HR practices is associated with higher proﬁtability in the subsequent year, at least in the manufacturing sector, but this association disappears once proﬁtability in previous years is taken into account.

They are inevitably cross- sectional data, and this should be borne in mind in making comparisons. The same regressions were applied, but using comparative estimates of produc- tivity and ﬁnancial performance as the dependent variables. The results are shown in Table 4. Looking ﬁrst at all 366 ﬁrms, the ﬁrst two columns in Table 4 show that there is a signiﬁcant association between greater use of HR practices and esti- mates of both productivity (beta 0.19; p < 0.000) and ﬁnancial performance (beta 0.12; p < 0.05). The results in other columns in Table 4 indicate that ﬁrms in both manufacturing and service sectors show a similar set of asso- ciations to the overall sample with respect to estimated productivity. Greater use of HR practices is signiﬁcantly associated with higher estimated produc- tivity (beta 0.19; p < 0.001 in manufacturing and beta 0.18; p < 0.05 in ser- vices). The  results  for  ﬁnancial  performance  in  the  two  sectors  are  less clear-cut. In both sectors the association between HR practices and estimated ﬁnancial performance falls just short of signiﬁcance (beta 0.10, n.s., in man- ufacturing and beta 0.13, n.s., in services). In  summary, there  is  evidence, based  on  estimates  of productivity  and ﬁnancial performance, of a positive association between greater use of HR practices  and  superior  performance; but, in  contrast  to  the  objective  mea- sures, the association is greater with productivity than with ﬁnancial perfor- mance. When  subjective  estimates  of performance  are  used, there  are  no major differences between the results for the two sectors. The results based on objective and subjective measures of performance differ in a number of ways. We  must  therefore  reject  Hypothesis  2, which  suggested  that  there would  be  similar  set  of results  using  objective  and  subjective  performance measures. 6. Discussion and conclusions This study set out to explore the relationship between HRM and performance for a sizeable sample of UK organizations in the manufacturing and service sectors. The results are very mixed and on balance predominantly negative. The tests of association show a positive relationship between use of more HR practices  and  lower  labour  turnover  and  higher  proﬁtability, but  show  no association between HR and productivity. The test of whether the presence of more HR practices results in a change in performance shows no signiﬁ- cant results. These results are consistent with the argument that the beneﬁts of HR have accrued  in  previous  years  and  therefore, while  reﬂected  in  the  association between HRM and proﬁtability, do not show up in further gains when prior performance is controlled. However, this argument must be viewed with con- siderable caution.

This appears to lend stronger support to the view that proﬁtability creates scope for more HRM rather than vice versa. Therefore, while the results reveal a positive association between HRM and proﬁtability, they do not support the assumption that HRM led to the higher proﬁtability. Future research might try  to  determine  when  speciﬁc  practices  were  introduced  as  a  means  of exploring  whether  there  is  any  real  causal  effect  that  has  not  already  been accounted for in increased performance once they have been in place for some time. However, attempts  to  measure  the  introduction  of practices  that  are likely to have existed in some form for a number of years are fraught with difﬁculty. Disaggregation  of the  results  to  compare  the  manufacturing  and  service sectors  revealed  no  consistent  differences, with  a  single  notable  exception: both  the  disaggregated  analysis  and  the  interaction  effect  conﬁrm  that  the association  between  HRM  and  the  objective  measure  of performance  is stronger in manufacturing than in services. Given the arguments about the potential role of HRM in service effectiveness, and bearing in mind the pos- itive results obtained by Batt (2002) and others, this is a surprising ﬁnding. Why have we found these different results? We used two sources of data to explore this issue further. One is the Workplace Employee Relations Survey (WERS)  (Cully  et  al. 1999), the  other  is  the  background  information  pro- vided for a subset of the ﬁrms by the CEOs who were interviewed. The ﬁrst step was to examine the WERS data, recognizing that they are based  on  establishment  rather  than  company-level  research, to  ﬁnd  out whether  similar  results  would  be  found. Using  regression  equations  con- structed as far as possible in a similar way to those in this study, the analy- sis revealed that there was a signiﬁcant association between having a greater number of HR practices in place and estimates of comparative ﬁnancial per- formance in both sectors (manufacturing: beta 0.27; p < 0.05; services: beta 0.16; p < 000). Since these results ask for comparisons within the sector, they are  not  directly  comparable  with  proﬁt  per  employee. However, we  might expect them to be more in line with the subjective estimates provided by the managers in the Future of Work study and, as our results have shown, this was indeed the case. The second step was to examine the data on context provided by the CEOs in  the  manufacturing  and  service  ﬁrms  to  search  for  any  differences  that might help to explain the ﬁndings. Data were available on both the market and  the  level  of competition  within  it  for  144  ﬁrms  in  the  sample  of 366. Based on this subgroup, the analysis suggests that manufacturing ﬁrms are more likely than service ﬁrms to report that the main market for their key products  is  overseas, and  they  are  more  likely  to  sell  at  least  5  per  cent  of their main product to a single customer. Not surprisingly, they are also more likely to see overseas ﬁrms as major competitors. Another and largely pre- dictable difference is that manufacturing ﬁrms are likely to spend more on R&D. It  is  also  notable  that  in  the  manufacturing  sector  being  a  multina- © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2003. 310 British Journal of Industrial Relations tional organization is likely to be associated with higher performance, while in services it is more likely to be associated with lower performance. We  hypothesized  that  there  would  be  no  differences  in  the  results  when using objective and subjective measures of performance. As noted, the dif- ferences  between  the  manufacturing  and  service-sector  results  are  stronger when the more objective and independent information provided by Dun and Bradstreet is used than with the subjective comparisons provided by the man- agers. Indeed, the association between HRM and performance is consistently positive when the subjective performance measures are used. Furthermore, the subjective measures show a stronger association between HRM and pro- ductivity than between HRM and ﬁnancial performance, in line with expec- tations  and  in  contrast  to  the  results  using  the  objective  measures. It  is important to emphasize that we are not comparing like with like. Indeed, as noted earlier, the correlation between average sales per employee from 1997 to 1999 and estimated productivity is only 0.06, while the correlation between proﬁt per employee in the same period and estimated ﬁnancial performance is a rather more encouraging 0.33. It is, for example, possible to report low ‘objective’ proﬁt  per  employee  and  also  high  comparative  ﬁnancial  perfor- mance when set alongside that of competitors. It is also important to bear in mind that the subjective results are cross-sectional. Given  the  relatively  limited  impact  of HRM  on  performance, one  pos- sibility  is  that  other  formal  features  of the  employment  relationship  were more important. The evidence, based on analysis of the impact of the control variables in the regression analysis, shows that this was not the case. Union density and union recognition were very highly correlated, and just over half the ﬁrms that had a union density of over 25 per cent also had a single union deal. In the regressions, a single union deal was associated with lower sub- jective estimates of manufacturing productivity, and the presence of a con- sultative  committee  was  associated  with  lower  labour  turnover, notably  in manufacturing. Other contextual factors such as size, being a multinational and using HR to control costs had a stronger association with outcomes than the formal aspects of the employment relationship. A distinctive feature of this study has been the use of a variety of research strategies  along  three  dimensions. The  performance  measures  are  either  subjective  or  objective; the  data  are  collected  cross-sectionally  and  over  time; and the key test is one of either association or causation. The results vary according to the methods used, and they fall into a distinctive pattern. Essentially, when  we  use  what  might  be  described  as  the  weaker  tests, namely subjective performance estimates in cross-sectional data, to explore associations, the  results  show  a  positive  relationship  between  HRM  and  performance. With  what  we  can  term  ‘intermediate  tests’, consisting  of objective performance measures, collected after the introduction of HRM but still testing for association, the results are mixed. When we apply the strict test, using objective performance measures, controlling for past performance and testing for change in performance, then no associations of any sort are found. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2003. Human Resource Management and Performance 311 In summary, the results depend on the speciﬁc research question explored, the measures used and the test applied. If we are interested in demonstrating an association between greater use of HR practices and performance, then the results are generally positive; if we are more interested in showing that HR  practices  are  associated  with  a  change  in  performance, then  they  are  negative. We are still left with the question of why, when the stricter tests are used, the results of this study appear to be more negative than many other pub- lished studies in showing little or no association between HRM and perfor- mance. One possible explanation lies in the choice of measure of HRM. This study has been concerned with HR practices rather than HR strategy, busi- ness strategy and the strategic context. This reﬂects the dominant ﬁnding in most American studies suggesting that ‘internal ﬁt’, based on some count of HR  practices  and  assumptions  about  their  alignment, provides  the  more important link to outcomes (Becker and Huselid 1998). We used a measure of HR practices that sought to capture the concept of an HR system, and therefore combined the scores on the nine core HR practices. We also used a strict cut-off whereby the practices had to apply to 90 per cent of the work- force. As noted earlier, this reﬂected the view that a distinctive feature of some models of HRM is that practices should apply to the whole workforce. Some experimentation, based  on  a  lower  percentage  cut-off point, a  continuum from  0  to  100  per  cent  or  different  combinations  of practices  based  on notions  of a  high-performance  or  high-commitment  work  system, did  not signiﬁcantly alter the results. Therefore, while acknowledging that different ways of measuring HR practices are possible and that these may be based on different theories about what constitutes HRM, we do not believe that they would signiﬁcantly alter the results in this study. The neglect of the strategic dimension of ‘external ﬁt’ in this paper is a limitation, but it is based on pre- vious evidence about the key associations. Further explanations for the absence of evidence about the impact of HRM on performance may lie in the sample and context. There is some evidence that parts of the service sector are under-represented. However, there is a strong representation from manufacturing, and even in this sector the results fail to demonstrate any causal link between HRM and performance. It is possible that a study of this type that is based in the European context may reﬂect some of the constraints highlighted by Pauuwe (1996: 88) such as the need to impose a set of relatively standard employment practices, and the somewhat stronger traditions  of taking  some  account  of stakeholder  interests; but  this  seems unlikely. We are therefore left with the somewhat paradoxical conclusion that these results, in what is probably the largest company-level UK study to date, show some evidence of an association between HRM and performance but, in the absence of evidence about when HR practices were introduced, fails to provide any convincing indication that greater application of HRM is likely to result in improved corporate performance.

We would also like to acknowledge the additional  support  provided  by  the  Chartered  Institute  of Personnel  and Development to enable us to expand the sample size. Melvina Metochi, now with  the  Laiki  Bank, was  the  researcher  in  the  early  phases  of the  project when  the  questionnaires  were  being  designed  and  distributed, and  we acknowledge  her  help. Finally, we  would  like  to  thank  the  editors  of this special issue and the reviewers for their thorough-going and incisive reviews of earlier drafts. Notes 1. The study also included interviews with 462 chief executives, including 237 from ﬁrms where the HR manager was also interviewed. Since detailed information on HR practices was collected only from the HR managers, it was decided to omit the CEO data from this study. The disadvantage of this is that they provided the infor- mation on strategy and context. Furthermore, since we had ﬁnancial data on only 144 of the ﬁrms for which we had matched pairs of responses, this would have con- siderably  reduced  the  sample  size. Further  details  of the  CEO  responses  can  be found in Guest et al. (2000). 2. In this context it is worth noting that 63 per cent of CEOs in the study said they benchmarked  ﬁnancial  performance, and  44  per  cent  said  they  benchmarked labour productivity, so there is some basis for the comparisons. Questions about benchmarking were not put to the HR managers. 3. In both cases we considered using the log of sales or proﬁt per employee. However, there was no evidence of an abnormal distribution so we did not use the log scores in the reported analysis. We did in fact test the results using log scores, and they were not signiﬁcantly different. 4. Even when a different cut-off point, such as use of practices with 50 per cent or more of the workforce, was used, the adoption of practices remained low. 5. We used the three-year period 1997–99 because the data for 1996 were less com- plete for a number of companies in the sample. References Appelbaum, E., Bailey, T., Berg, P. and  Kalleberg, A. (2000).
