Our results suggest that strong stock market performance leads to greater ?rm investment in aspects of CSR devoted to employee relations, but that CSR activities do not affect ?nancial performance.

McWilliams and Siegel (2001) de?ne CSR as ‘‘actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the ?rm and that which is required by law,’’ (p. 17). Examples of CSR include support of local businesses or char- ities, developing recycling programs, and promoting minority employment. Though these activities certainly result in societal bene?ts, opinions differ as to whether a ?rm’s CSR activity enhances ?nancial performance. For instance, CSR has been described as being  E.

Webb  ‘‘little more than a cosmetic treatment,’’ (The Good Company 2005) while an earlier article in the ?nancial press touted the economic advantages for companies practicing CSR (Fittipaldi 2004).  CSR has attracted the attention of mutual fund investors, including TIAA CREF, and a number of funds use CSR as a screening device for investment selection. However, any bene?ts investors derive from including socially responsible ?rms in their portfolios do not appear to be in form of superior returns. Bello (2005) matches socially responsible mutual funds to conventional funds in the late 1990s and ?nds no signi?cant difference in long-run investment performance or portfolio diversi?cation between the two groups. According to Statman (2000), the Domini Social Index (DSI) did as well as the S&P 500 between 1990 and 1998. He ?nds that some socially responsible funds performed worse than the S&P 500 and the DSI, but fared no worse than conventional mutual funds during the time period. Academic research has examined the causal relation between CSR and ?nancial performance—what is sometimes referred to as the ‘‘virtuous circle’’—to determine if ‘‘doing good’’ socially leads to ‘‘doing well’’ ?nancially, and whether ?rms exhibiting superior ?nancial performance devote more resources to social activities. Why should a ‘‘virtuous circle’’ exist? Waddock and Graves (1997) suggest that positive stakeholder relationships can reduce the likelihood of dif?culty when dealing with groups such as employees, customers, and the community. In addition, good social performance and good managerial practice may be related, so this in turn may lead to strong ?nancial performance. For instance, Cheng et al. (2006) ?nd that ?rms with strong shareholder rights tend to have a lower cost of equity capital than competing ?rms, which supports the idea that reducing agency problems between stakeholders and management improves ?nancial performance. Ferreira et al. (2008) ?nd that large ?rms bene?t in the form of positive long-run stock performance following certi?cation of quality management. This suggests that in the case of large companies, good managerial practice does indeed improve the bottom line.  The empirical evidence suggests that a virtuous circle exists. Waddock and Graves (1997) and Hillman and Keim (2001) ?nd that increased CSR leads to enhanced ?nancial performance and vice versa. McGuire et al. (1988) ?nd that prior year’s stock returns and accounting-based performance measures are related to current measures of CSR, but that a past record of good social performance does not affect the current ?nancial performance of a ?rm.  Despite the extensive body of research on CSR and ?nancial performance, we believe that additional analysis is warranted. In this study, we use alternative statistical techniques to provide new insights on the causal relationship between ?rm performance and CSR. The studies cited above and others on the topic have typically employed ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions with 1-year lagged values of one variable (e.g., CSR) used as deter- minants of the other (e.g., ROA). Indeed, we also ?nd that CSR and performance are related when we use standard OLS regression models. However, in a time series ?xed effects approach with over 2,800 ?rm-year observations, we ?nd that the relation between CSR and ?nancial performance is much weaker than that documented in past studies. We also ?nd little evidence of causality between ?nancial performance and narrower measures of social performance. Overall, we ?nd weak evidence that strong stock market perfor- mance leads to greater levels of CSR that focus speci?cally on employee relations. However, CSR activity does not lead to changes in a ?rm’s ?nancial performance.  This study contributes to the literature on CSR in several ways. We use a more com- prehensive time-series of CSR data relative to past studies. Also, previous research analyzing the link between CSR and ?nancial performance does not account for possible  123  Corporate social responsibility and ?nancial performance  199  persistence or unobservable characteristics that may play a role in the level of CSR activity undertaken by a ?rm. We examine these important considerations by using Granger causality and controlling for ?rm ?xed-effects in our time series. We also use a Tobit speci?cation for models of CSR causality to account for the censored nature of the data. Finally, our speci?cations also include analysis of narrow measures of social performance such as how the company treats employees, the environment, the community, and diversity issues. The use of appropriate statistical methods and examination of the components of CSR yield added insights regarding the relation between CSR and ?nancial performance.  2 Data and research methods  To measure CSR, we use the KLD Socrates Database.1 This database rates companies on the various degrees of social responsibility including community participation, diversity, employee interests, environmental considerations, and shareholder interests. This index is superior to alternative measures of CSR because it is compiled by an independent rating service that focuses on a wide range of ?rms over a broad spectrum of CSR screens, whereas alternative measures of CSR focus on a small sample of ?rms or use a narrow CSR screen. Each screen in the KLD database is summarized in terms of strengths (positive values) and concerns (negative values). For instance, the community screen is calculated on the basis of strengths, such as generous giving or support for education in the area, and concerns, such as investment controversies or negative economic impact on the community.  We calculate a weighted average of the overall index to represent each ?rm’s aggregate level of CSR, using the weights developed by Waddock and Graves (1997). We use these weights to facilitate comparison of results, and to highlight the effect of a different esti- mation methodology on statistical inferences. Waddock and Graves calculate weights using expert panel evaluations on the relative importance of each CSR attribute. Weigh- tings are as follows: Employee relations: 0.168; Product: 0.154; Community relations: 0.148; Environment: 0.142; Treatment of women and minorities: 0.136; Nuclear power: 0.089; Military contracts: 0.086; South Africa: 0.076. Our sample extends from 1993 to 2000 and includes data on more than 600 U.S. ?rms. We assess ?nancial performance using both accounting (return on assets, or ROA) and market-based (common stock returns) measures from Compustat.  Table 1 presents summary statistics for our measures of CSR and ?nancial performance and control variables. The variable SCORE, which is the sum of the individual scores for the various CSR strengths and concerns, ranges from -11 (indicating signi?cant concerns) to +11 (indicating signi?cant strengths), with a median value of zero. The minimum WSCORE, which represents the weighted average measure of CSR for each ?rm, is -1.07 with a maximum value of +1.74. We then create narrower CSR scores by summing the scores in four categories of the KLD index: community, diversity, employee relations, and environment. The median value for each is zero. The lowest minimum score is for total environment score at -5 while the highest maximum score is diversity at 7. Panel B presents data on the values of SCORE by industry. Not surprisingly, signi?cantly negative averages appear in the tobacco industry (average = -2.08), the mining industry (aver- age = -1.54), and the transportation industry (average = -1.43). The largest positive average (1.02) exists in the retail trade industry, possibly because these ?rms stand to  1 Information about this database is available online at http://www.kld.com/research/socrates/index.html.  123  200  E.

CSR SCORE is the sum of the component scores in the KLD Socrates Database, and WSCORE is the weighted average  bene?t the most from the positive association their customers may attribute to the ?rm’s CSR activity.  In Table 2, we report the correlation matrix for the sample of ?rms used in this study. In particular, we are interested in the correlations between WSCORE and measures of ?nancial performance. In the ?rst column of Table 2, we see that WSCORE is positively correlated with contemporaneous ROA and annual stock returns and negatively correlated with leverage (long-term debt divided by total assets). There is no signi?cant correlation between WSCORE and ?rm size, measured by total assets or sales. This simple correlation analysis does not address issues of causality, but provides initial evidence that CSR and ?nancial performance are directly related. We use traditional regression analysis in our initial examination of the causal relationship between CSR and ?nancial performance. We then argue that ordinary least-squares regressions cannot adequately assess causality issues, and introduce Granger causality models and Tobit regressions to examine the relationship in greater detail.

We explain the details of these statistical approaches in the following section.  3 Results  3.1 Results of OLS models  Panel A of Table 3 presents results of OLS regression models similar to those in Waddock and Graves (1997) with the weighted social responsibility score in year t as the dependent variable. The primary independent variable is ?nancial performance in year t - 1, measured either by return on assets or the return on the ?rm’s common stock. Sales, total assets, and debt-to-assets in year t - 1 are included as controls for ?rm size and leverage. In general, we ?nd that the relationship between social responsibility and lagged ?nancial performance is positive and signi?cant, similar to what is reported by Waddock and Graves (1997). Leverage is negative and signi?cant in each model, sug- gesting that ?rms with a higher proportion of debt ?nancing exhibit lower levels of CSR. The coef?cients on lagged ROA and lagged stock returns (in Panel A) are all positive and signi?cant at the 1% level. Coef?cients on the size control variables (sales and total assets) are positive, suggesting that larger ?rms may have greater resources available to support CSR efforts.  Panel B of Table 3 presents the results of models with ?nancial performance—ROA and annual stock returns—as the dependent variable. In each of the models (5)–(8) in Table 3, the coef?cient on the lagged weighted CSR score is positive and signi?cant. This result, consistent with that of Waddock and Graves (1997), implies that a ?rm’s level of CSR activity contributes to its ?nancial performance.  In summary, the OLS regression results presented in Table 1 suggest that a ‘‘virtuous circle’’ exists, linking a ?rm’s level of CSR with its ?nancial performance. In the sections below, we introduce alternative estimation methods that may be more appropriate than OLS for the analysis.  123  202  E. Nelling, E.

For example, variables such as corporate culture or managerial in?uence may be signi?cant determinants of CSR activity. Using a ?xed effects regression model allows us to estimate the effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable while controlling for the effect of unobserved variables.  The results of our ?xed effects models are presented in Table 4 and they reveal interesting differences compared to the OLS regression results presented in Table 3. A ?rm’s past ?nancial performance as measured by ROA continues to be a signi?cant determinant of CSR score—i.e., ROA and CSR are positively related. However, as noted in Models (3) and (4), a ?rm’s past stock return is no longer a signi?cant determinant of its CSR score. Furthermore, the weighted CSR score is no longer a signi?cant predictor of ?nancial performance, as seen in Models (5)–(8) in Panel B of Table 4. These results suggest that by controlling for ?rm ?xed effects, the relationship between CSR and ?nancial performance is not as strong as previously reported in the literature.  123  Corporate social responsibility and ?nancial performance  203  Table 4 Fixed effects regressions of corporate social responsibility and ?nancial performance  Panel A  WSCORE is dependent variable  Model  (1)  (2)  (3)  (4)  INTERCEPT  -0.439 (-4.31)*** -0.387 (-3.91)*** -0.428 (-4.19)*** -0.357 (-3.64)***  ROA(t - 1)  0.002 (2.57)***  0.002 (2.88)***  RET(t - 1)  LEV(t - 1)  0.047 (0.76)  0.028 (0.45)  SALES(t - 1)  0.067 (5.35)***  0.001 (0.06)  0.014 (0.23)  0.068 (5.41)***  0.001 (0.10)  -0.010 (-0.16)  0.059 (4.92)***  0.058 (4.85)***  ASSETS(t - 1)  N Adjusted R2  2731  0.001  F  12.16***  10.79***  2789  0.005  2727  0.001  9.88***  2786  0.004  8.02***  Panel B  ROA is dependent variable  RET is dependent variable  Model  (5)  (6)  (7)  (8)  INTERCEPT  14.320 (4.82)***  24.680 (8.63)***  109.752 (4.64)***  116.675 (5.07)***  WSCORE(t - 1) -0.417 (-0.70)  -0.004 (-0.01)  0.869 (0.18)  LEV(t - 1)  -2.332 (-1.38)  -0.793 (-0.48)  0.736 (0.05)  1.270 (0.26)  6.480 (0.47)  SALES(t - 1)  -0.971 (-2.62)***  -11.451 (-3.90)***  ASSETS(t - 1)  -2.238 (-6.38)***  -12.096 (-4.31)***  N Adjusted R2 F  2558  0.008  3.62**  2615  0.041  14.94***  2869  0.003  5.19***  2932  0.006  6.32***  WSCORE is the weighted social responsibility score from the KLD Socrates Database.

An interesting question arises as to the nature of causality, if any, between doing ‘‘good’’ through greater CSR activity and doing ‘‘well’’ ?nancially. Does good ?nancial performance cause a ?rm to become more socially responsible, or does a high level of CSR lead to subsequent superior ?nancial performance? Good ?nancial performance may result in more resources being available for the pursuit of CSR goals. A high level of CSR may attract the attention of investors or customers or motivate employees to perform better and reduce costs, boosting ?nancial performance. Another possibility is that a ‘‘virtuous circle’’ exists, and the causality runs in both directions.  We address the link between ?nancial performance and CSR in the context of Granger causality. This approach, developed by Granger (1969), involves regression models of the form  SCOREt ¼ a0 þ a1SCOREt
