REMOVING THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  HALO FROM FORTUNE'S "MOST  ADMIRED" COMPANIES  BRAD BROWN  SUSAN PERRY  University of Virginia  Fortune's annual ratings of America's largest corporations are shown  to be heavily influenced by previous financial results, thus creating a  halo that must be removed before these qualitative reputational mea-  sures can be used appropriately in other research. This article presents  a method for removing that performance halo and demonstrates the  method's validity.  Many interesting organizational research questions are difficult to an-  swer because there are no readily available, direct measures of the constructs  of interest. For example, researchers may want to identify companies that are  innovative, ethical, well managed, or environmentally responsible. Without  direct measures, they are forced to develop secondary proxies that perhaps  capture only a portion of the constructs of interest. Although the use of proxy  variables is reasonable given the inability to directly study important issues,  researchers must constantly be mindful that the measures being analyzed are  proxies, not the actual constructs of interest.  Large-scale surveys that appear to measure organizational constructs  directly are sometimes reported in the popular press. Our research focuses  on the corporate attributes reported annually in Fortune's "most admired  corporations" issue (e.g., Ballen, 1992). Researchers must be cautious when  using these large-scale surveys because the characteristics of survey respon-  dents, data-gathering methods, and survey questions may introduce mea-  surement error. If this error is pervasive, coloring many or all of the indi-  vidual attribute ratings of an object-the objects in our study are the com-  panies in the Fortune surveys-a halo is said to exist. Before these large-  scale surveys can be used in academic research, this halo must be removed.  In this article, we examine the financial performance halo derived from the  We would like to thank Stanley Slater for his earlier research in this area and this journal's  anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.

We demonstrate the  validity of our method by comparing four of our halo-removed measures to  other, independently developed proxies for similar constructs. We also com-  pare the results of our method for removing the financial performance halo  with measures obtained using less satisfactory statistical techniques. Al-  though our specific model applies to the Fortune data, we believe that our  technique is broadly applicable and should be considered whenever wide-  spread measurement error is suspected in survey data.  Fortune's annual list of the most admired companies, published early  each year since 1983, ranks large corporations on the following eight qual-  itative attributes: quality of management, quality of products or services,  value as a long-term investment, innovativeness, soundness of financial po-  sition, ability to attract, develop, and keep talented people, responsibility to  the community and environment, and wise use of corporate assets. The  magazine collects data on the largest firms in over 30 industries. The survey  sample includes 8,000 executives, directors, and market analysts, each of  whom reports on the industry he or she follows. Industry analysts and ex-  ecutives within an industry have been shown to be reliable and accurate  raters of corporate strategy (Chen, Fahr, & MacMillan, 1993). With a response  rate of about 50 percent, Fortune's survey sample is probably larger than  most samples obtained by academic researchers and its members are prob-  ably more qualified and better informed. The results are widely circulated  and cited in popular press outlets. In short, this survey offers data from a  large sample of industry experts assessing qualitative dimensions of organ-  izational performance that are difficult to measure quantitatively.  Unfortunately, the Fortune most admired ratings have been shown to be  heavily influenced by previous financial performance. Financial perfor-  mance, which is generally measured by combinations of accounting returns,  stock market returns, sales growth, size, operating leverage, and so forth, has  explained from 42 percent (McGuire, Schneeweis, & Branch, 1990: 176) to 53  percent (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990: 250) of the variance (measured as ad-  justed R2) of the overall rating of firm quality in the Fortune survey. The  influence of financial performance is understandable: executives and indus-  try analysts are very interested in financial performance. But this problem  must be dealt with if the data are to be useful to researchers.  The eight individual attributes of corporate reputation rated in this sur-  vey have been shown to be very highly correlated. Fombrun and Shanley  (1990) used factor analysis on the eight variables and extracted one factor  that explained 84 percent of the variance. They concluded "that the eight  attributes elicited from respondents were components of an underlying and  stable construct of reputation" (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990: 245).1 However,  1 Fombrun and Shanley (1990: 245) found that the combination of the eight reputational  dimensions yielded an extremely reliable scale for overall reputation (ot = .97).

Halo is present whenever principal  components analysis results in "a common general factor showing high  loadings on nearly all attributes which accounts for appreciable variance"  (Dillon, Mulani, & Frederick, 1984: 194). The Fortune most admired survey  results are influenced by a strong halo, which renders the use of any single  attribute ratings questionable. Unfortunately, many recent studies of corpo-  rate social responsibility have relied on Fortune's ratings on responsibility to  the community and environment (e.g., Chakravarthy, 1986; McGuire,  Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988; O'Bannon & Preston, 1993; Sharfman, 1993).  The financial performance halo affecting results for the individual cor-  porate attributes rated in the Fortune survey poses a problem similar to those  faced by researchers studying human resource management issues (e.g., Coo-  per, 1981; Myers, 1965; Pulakos, Schmitt, & Ostroff, 1986; Thorndike, 1920)  and consumer behavior (e.g., Beckwith & Lehmann, 1975; Dillon et al., 1984;  Holbrook, 1983) as they struggled to remove distortion from the perceptual  judgments of those rating individual attributes of people, jobs, and products.  Both fields generally refer to this perceptual distortion-a blurring of dis-  tinctions among dimensions or attributes due to a strong overall impres-  sion-as a halo.  Many of the halo-removal techniques proposed by human resource  management and consumer behavior researchers were appropriate for re-  moving the halo from an individual rater's perceptions of an object (a person  or product). However, the data available from Fortune are summarized: in-  dividual raters' evaluations are unavailable and only mean data provided.  Therefore, some of the more sophisticated halo removal strategies (e.g., Dil-  lon et al., 1984; Holbrook, 1983) are either irrelevant or inappropriate in the  current research setting.  One simple strategy for removing halo distortions of attribute ratings is  to ignore the problematic first principal component because it is usually an  evaluative general factor (Dillon et al., 1984: 185). This strategy may be  appropriate to multifactor solutions, but in the case of the Fortune most  admired data set and its single-factor solution, ignoring the first principal  component leaves nothing on which to focus.  METHODS  The method we employed to remove the financial performance halo  from the Fortune ratings was a partialing-out strategy. We controlled for halo  statistically by forming a halo index, a set of variables believed responsible  for the presence of halo, and partialed the halo out of the ratings using a  two-step process. First, the variables of interest (in this case, Fortune attrib- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:14:18 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1350 Academy of Management Journal October  ute ratings) were regressed against the halo index (in this case, various mea-  sures of recent financial performance). Coefficients generated in those re-  gressions were used to "model" each attribute, and firm-specific residuals  were calculated. These residuals (the portion of the Fortune ratings not  explained by prior financial performance) were the halo-removed attribute  ratings. As each attribute must be modeled separately, we performed the  above procedure eight times.  Sample Data  This study is based on 234 firms that met the following criteria: (1) They  were listed among "American's most admired corporations" in the February  10, 1992, issue of Fortune. These were 1991 ratings since Fortune surveys are  conducted during the fall of the year prior to publication of the issue con-  taining the ratings. (2) Their financial data from the 1988-91 period were  available on the 1991 COMPUSTAT tape.  Halo Removal  Fombrun and Shanley (1990) and McGuire and colleagues (1990) found  strong correlations between the Fortune ratings and a number of financial  and operational performance measures. Our halo index includes individual  measures of corporate earnings, returns, growth, size, and risk, all of which  are commonly used to measure corporate performance in the strategy and  finance literature. Using multiple measures of financial performance would  raise problems of multicollinearity and detract from parsimony. Therefore,  we created our halo index using five financial and operating variables, com-  puted as follows: average return on assets (ROA) = (ROAit + ROAit - 1 +  ROAit - 2)/3; relative market to book value = market value/book valuefirm  over market value/book valueindustry; sales = logarithm of salesit; growth =  (percent change in salest + . . . + percent change in salest - 2)/3; and risk  = debtit/equityit. Several other variables commonly used in financial stud-  ies, including stock market returns, were excluded from our final model  since their results were not statistically significantly and did not add to the  model's explanatory power. Table 1 gives summary statistics and the corre-  lation matrix of the halo index variables and the raw Fortune attributes.  These financial performance measures were employed as independent  variables in regression analyses on the Fortune attribute ratings. Table 2  presents the results of the nine regressions, one for each of the eight attrib-  utes and one for the ratings combined. The regression of the combined For-  tune ratings on the halo index had an adjusted R2 of .55, slightly greater than  that reported by either McGuire and colleagues (1990) or Fombrun and  Shanley (1990). The highest explanatory power existed in the financial per-  formance attribute, soundness of financial position (59%). However, even  innovativeness, which one might expect to be less correlated with financial  performance, had an adjusted R2 of 36 percent. These findings provide fur-  ther evidence of the presence of a strong financial performance halo in the  Fortune attribute ratings.

These residuals are halo-removed ratings for each of the eight attributes,  appropriate for use in research in which financial performance is also a  variable of interest.  VALIDATION TESTS  To demonstrate the validity of the halo-removed ratings, we compared  the halo-removed rating on four of these Fortune attributes with indepen-  dent evaluations of corporate performance on similar attributes. We also  compared our halo-removed measures with those obtained using a common  factor process that removed most of the correlations among the Fortune  attributes. Our final test employed a criss-cross analysis to ensure that our  halo-removed attributes were meaningfully different from one another and  that each was the best measure of the construct it was supposed to measure.  Comparison with Independent Evaluations  Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co., Inc. (KLD) applied a series of "social  screens," each composed of several individual, objective measures of a cor-  poration's social responsibility, to the hundreds of firms that it tracks. KLD,  an investment advisory service specializing in identifying socially respon-  sible companies for investors, used these measures to create the Domini 400  social index of corporations exhibiting social responsibility. Our database  had 196 companies that were included in both Fortune's 1992 most admired  companies list and the KLD database for 1991.  Each KLD measure of social responsibility is rated dichotomously (0 or  1), so they are a coarse measures but adequate for validation purposes. From  the KLD screens, we selected items that appeared to measure at least a  portion of the Fortune attributes and formed scales to represent four of our  halo-removed attribute ratings. For our first two proxies, we summed the  chosen KLD measures, with strengths having positive values and concerns  having negative values, to obtain greater range. The last two proxies were  single-item scales with limited range.2  The scales formed were as follows: (1) Fortune's responsibility to the  community and environment was represented by community and environ-  ment, a scale formed from 23 KLD items. Given that the KLD database was  developed to track corporate social responsibility, the large number of items  in this scale is not surprising. (2) Fortune's ability to attract, develop, and  keep talented people was represented by five KLD items that we designated  employee relations. (3) For Fortune's quality of products or services, we  2 Descriptions and summary statistics of the KLD measures are available upon request. We  chose items for their face validity. The two multiple-item scales are not reliable in a statistical  sense. The KLD scales are formed from dichotomous variables, which on the average are scored  1 on only 8 percent of the observations. The range in the KLD data is very limited, and treating  individual items as continuous measures is questionable. And because the individual KLD  items measure specific attributes that are relatively independent but collectively measure a  single broad construct, such as responsibility to the community and environment, scale reli-  ability as measured by Cronbach's alpha can be expected to be low.

(4) For Fortune's  innovativeness, we also used a single KLD item, "The company is consis-  tently among the leaders in its industry in research and development (R&D)  expenditures as a percentage of sales, or the company has a reputation for  exceptional inventiveness in new product development."  Table 3 presents the correlations between the four halo-removed For-  tune attributes and their corresponding KLD social screen proxies. We per-  formed a series of four simple regression analyses of the halo-removed at-  tributes on their corresponding KLD proxies. The regression for responsibil-  ity to the community and environment had an R2 of .11; for ability to attract,  develop, and keep talented people, the R2 was .09; for quality of products or  services, the R2 was .13; and for innovativeness, the R2 was .02.3 Results of  the first three regressions were significant at p < .0001, and the innovative-  ness equation was significant at p = .02. We concluded that these regression  analyses supported the validity of the halo removal process and the halo-  removed measures.4  3The explanatory power of each regression analysis was limited by the relatively small  number of positive observations on most of the KLD database items. For instance, only eight  companies (about 4%) were rated as particularly innovative.  4Regression analyses of the raw Fortune attributes (before halo removal) on the same four  KLD proxy variables also yielded significant results. Two of the four raw regressions had about  the same explanatory power (adjusted R2) as our halo-removed variables. The raw scores for the  third, quality of product, explained less of the variance than our halo-removed variable (8% vs.  13%) and ability to attract, develop, and keep talented people explained more than our halo-  (continued) This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:14:18 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1994 Brown and Perry 1355  Comparison with the Common Factor Removal Method  We examined a different approach to removing halo distortions by tak-  ing advantage of the single-factor structure of the Fortune data. The corre-  lations among dimensions are attributed to a general or common factor (Jack-  son, 1983). The portion of a corporation's rating on a dimension not ex-  plained by the common factor is assumed to be specific to that dimension.  Factor ratings can be used to develop an expectations model, the residuals of  which are the dimensions or attribute ratings purged of the common factor,  or halo. This common factor removal method is designed to remove all the  shared variance captured by that first principal component.  In this sample factor analytic model, a company's rating on any attribute  (Zjj) is the sum of three components: Zij = a?fi + mi + djuij, where i iden-  tifies a company, j identifies an attribute, aj represents the loading of the jth  attribute on the common factor, fi represents the factor scores of the indi-  vidual company, mj is the mean score for all companies on attribute j, dj is  a constant across all companies for the jth attribute, and uij is an unobserved  variable, both company-specific and attribute-specific. The individual com-  panies' attribute-specific scores, djuij, can be determined from the above  equation (djuij = Zij - ajfi - mj) and can be considered halo-removed  measures.  The assumption underlying this model is that the true constructs are  independent and uncorrelated. But the apparent purity of the measures ob-  tained using this technique can present a problem; often a researcher sus-  pects that the underlying constructs are correlated. For instance, in analyz-  ing Fortune's most admired companies, it is reasonable to assume some  "construct content overlap" (Spector, 1987) among even such nonfinancial  variables as quality of management, ability to attract, develop, and keep  talented people, and innovativeness. Good management may be reflected in  progressive personnel policies and a record of innovation. Use of the com-  mon factor removal technique will treat what may well be construct content  overlap as measurement error and eliminate it, sacrificing potentially useful  information. However, we demonstrate the common factor removal process  and compare its results with those of our preferred method of halo removal.  Correlation tables can illustrate some differences between our method  and the common factor removal method. Table 4 presents three correlation  matrixes in one: correlations of the raw Fortune rankings appear in plain  type; those for the halo-removed variables derived from our method appear  in parentheses; and those for the variables obtained from the common factor  removal process appear in italics. We made no attempt to show correlations  removed variable (15% vs. 11%). But in most research using these attribute ratings, the point is  not to demonstrate their validity, but to measure their effects on other variables, frequently  those measuring financial performance. Even though our halo-removed measures did not al-  ways explain more of the variance of the KLD screens than their associated raw measures, it  would be ill-advised to perform analyses with the latter as they are so heavily influenced by  financial performance.

Using  our preferred method, we reduced correlations by an average of 13.3 percent.  The common factor removal process greatly reduced correlations, leaving  many negative values.  As expected, our controlled halo removal technique (it is controlled in  that we are removing only the financial performance halo from the measure-  ments) yielded measures that are much more closely associated with the  independent proxy variables than those obtained using the common factor  removal process. We conducted regression analyses using variables with  common factors removed for responsibility to the community and environ-  ment, ability to attract, develop, and keep talented people, quality of prod-  ucts or services, and innovativeness on our associated KLD social screen  proxies, but only the results for innovativeness were significant, explaining  2 percent of the variance-about the same amount our preferred method had  explained (results are available upon request).

Our results support their  findings. Therefore, we consider our halo removal process, which removes  only the known financial performance halo, not all correlations with other  attributes, superior.  Further Validation Using a Criss-Cross Design  Another test of validity employed a criss-cross design (Seltzer & Bass,  1990). If our halo-removed measures are to be useful, each must explain  more of the variance of the corresponding proxy we developed from the KLD  social screens than do any of the other halo-removed Fortune attributes.  Some explanatory power from the crossed regression equations is acceptable  given the assumed construct content overlap, but the appropriate equations  should have more explanatory power. In every case, we found that regres-  sions of the appropriate halo-removed Fortune attributes on their corre-  sponding KLD social screens explained more variance than regressions of  crossed or mismatched Fortune attributes on the KLD social screens (results  are available upon request). We concluded that the criss-cross tests further  support the validity of our halo removal procedure.  CONCLUSIONS  This article demonstrates the extent to which financial performance  influences the ratings of Fortune's most admired companies and presents a  technique for removing that halo to derive the underlying construct. In our  research, we validated that technique by demonstrating a strong association  between four of the halo-removed variables and proxy variables developed  from another data source (Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co.) and by dem-  onstrating our method's superiority to the common factor removal and criss-  cross design processes. Researchers wishing to use Fortune's ratings for at-  tributes that can be theoretically distinguished from financial performance  should remove the financial performance halo before using the data, espe-  cially if they are testing the impact of one or more of these attributes on  corporate financial performance or stock market returns. If the financial  performance halo is not removed, the use of the Fortune most admired  company attributes will confound results. We suggest that the halo-removed  technique demonstrated in this article is generalizable beyond its current use  and that researchers consider its application before using measures derived  from any survey results that may be heavily influenced by factors extraneous  to the construct of interest.  We suspect that the high correlations that remained after removal of the  financial performance halo were largely the result of construct content  overlap; many of the attributes are similar or theoretically related and  would be expected to be correlated. The superior performance of our halo-  removed measures (relative to the measures developed using the common  factor removal process) in explaining the independent proxy variables sup- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:14:18 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1358 Academy of Management Journal October  ports this notion. However, we also suspect that an additional halo not  influenced by financial performance may exist in the Fortune data, a halo  related to the construct of corporate reputation sought by Fombrun and  Shanley (1990: 245). The factors that drive this possible corporate reputation  halo and that halo's potential for confounding other research will be left for  future investigations, but researchers should recognize those possibilities  when using halo-removed measures in their research.  Our results suggest several areas for future research. First, it would be  useful if others would revalidate this technique by removing the financial  performance halo from the Fortune database using other independent mea-  sures. In addition, it would be interesting to see the technique applied to  databases other than Fortune's survey. And finally, we would like to see  halo-removed variables used in other research.  Practicing managers should realize that the Fortune most admired com-  panies rankings, although entertaining (especially if your company is highly  regarded), are strongly driven by prior financial performance. Ratings of  companies on single dimensions are not particularly informative because of  that financial performance halo.  REFERENCES  Ballen, K. 1992. America's most admired corporations.
