STRATEGIC HRM PRACTICES AND THEIR IMPACT ON COMPANY PERFORMANCE IN CHINESE ENTERPRISES S Y E D   A K H TA R ,   D A N I E L   Z .   D I N G ,   A N D   G L O R I A   L .   G E This study examined the factorial validity of strategic human resource man- agement practices and their effects on company performance in a sample of 465 Chinese enterprises. Data were collected through two questionnaire sur- veys among general managers and HRM directors on product/service per- formance of their companies and a range of strategic HRM practices. Our findings indicate that a valid set of strategic HRM practices (training, partici- pation, results-oriented appraisals, and internal career opportunities) affect both product/service performance and financial performance. Employment security and job descriptions contribute uniquely to product/service per- formance, whereas profit sharing contributes uniquely to financial perform- ance.© 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. IntroductionR esearchers  have  argued  that  human resources may be seen as a source of sustained  competitive  advantage  for organizations  (Barney,  1991,  1995; Becker & Gerhart, 1996). The under- lying  assumption  is  that  human  resources are  unique  to  the  extent  that  competitors cannot  imitate  them.  This  research  has  led to the identification of a number of human resource  management  practices  that  con- tribute to company performance across dif- ferent organizations (Huselid, 1995). In a lit- erature  review,  Delery  and  Doty  (1996) identified  seven  such  practices  that  have been consistently considered strategic HRM practices. They defined strategic HRM prac- tices as those that are “theoretically or em- pirically  related  to  overall  organizational performance”  (p.  805).  These  practices  in- clude  internal  career  opportunities,  formal training systems, results-oriented appraisals, employment  security,  participation,  job  de- scriptions, and profit sharing. This approach has  come  to  be  known  as  the  “best  prac- tices” or universalistic approach.  Within  the  best  practices  approach  to strategic  HRM,  the  first  practice,  internal  ca- reer opportunities, refers to the organizational Correspondence to: Syed Akhtar, Department of Management, City University of Hong Kong Phone: (852) 2788- 7870, Fax: (852) 2788-7220, E-mail: mgsyed@cityu.edu.hk.

Second,  training  sys- tems refers to whether organizations provide extensive training opportunities for their em- ployees or whether they depend on selection and socialization processes to obtain required skills. Third, appraisals are conceptualized in terms  of  outcome-based  performance  ratings and the extent to which subordinate views are taken  into  account  in  these  ratings.  Fourth, employment  security  reflects  the  degree  to which employees feel secure about continued employment  in  their  jobs.  Although  formal- ized employment security is gener- ally  on  the  decline,  organizations may have either an implicit or an explicit  policy.  Fifth,  employee participation, both in terms of tak- ing  part  in  decision  making  and having  opportunities  to  commu- nicate  suggestions  for  improve- ment,  has  emerged  as  a  strategic HRM  practice.  Sixth,  job  descrip- tion  refers  to  the  extent  jobs  are tightly and clearly defined so that employees know what is expected of them. Finally, profit sharing re- flects the concern for overall orga- nizational  performance  on  a  sus- tainable basis.  Other  approaches  to  strategic HRM  research  include  contin- gency  and  configurational  ap- proaches. The contingency approach implies that  organizational  strategy  (e.g.,  cost,  qual- ity,  innovation)  moderates  the  relationships between  strategic  HRM  practices  and  com- pany performance. In other words, a particu- lar  HRM  practice  may  influence  company performance positively in combination with one  strategy  and  negatively  in  combination with  another  strategy.  The  configurational approach  builds  on  the  two  previous  ap- proaches  and  synthesizes  them  into  a  high- order  system  in  which  researchers  are  inter- ested  in  identifying  the  unique  patterns  of strategic HRM practices that are optimally ef- fective.  Although  compelling  theoretical  ar- guments have been made in favor of the con- tingency and configurational approaches, we argue  that  currently  there  is  relatively  weak empirical  support  for  these  approaches. Progress in this area of research would seem to  depend  on  the  emergence  of  new  tech- niques to measure HRM configurations.  The present study adopts the best prac- tices approach to examining strategic HRM practices  and  their  influence  on  company performance.  It  contributes  to  the  extant literature  in  three  ways.  First,  it  examines the factorial validity of the previously out- lined  seven  strategic  HRM  practices  in  the context of Chinese enterprises using a large sample  that  cuts  across  firm  age,  size,  in- dustry  sector,  ownership,  and  location  of the  enterprise.  We  expect  that  our  results will help to determine whether or not meas- ures of strategic HRM practices can be gen- eralized  across  organizations  and  countries with  a  view  to  facilitating  comparative  re- search.  Second,  we  discuss  in  some  detail how the seven strategic HRM practices cur- rently  are  applied  in  Chinese  enterprises and  their  development  trends.  This  will shed some light on how Western HRM con- cepts and practices are adapted in the newly emerging market economy of China. Third, we examine how these strategic HRM prac- tices  impact  a  firm’s  product/service  per- formance  and  financial  performance.  This will  help  identify  a  set  of  strategic  HRM practices that influence both these perform- ance indices. Literature Review and Research Questions How valid is the use of strategic HRM prac- tices  in  Chinese  enterprises?  Have  these practices been adapted when applied in the Chinese context? Do these practices matter in terms of their influence on company per- formance? These questions need to be raised in  the  context  of  the  Chinese  economy, which  is  in  transition  from  a  centrally planned economy to a form of a free market economy.  Of  particular  interest  are  the changes  that  have  taken  place  in  people management because traditionally, this area is  one  in  which  large  differences  have  ex- isted  between  communist  and  advanced market  economies  (Ding,  Fields,  &  Akhtar, Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm Strategic HRM Practices and Their Impact on Company Performance 17 1997;  Warner,  1996).  In  the  following  sec- tions, we present an overview of the litera- ture that has raised these questions and has sought their answers. How Valid Are Strategic HRM Practices? It must be said that before the economic re- forms  began  in  1978,  China’s  state-owned enterprises  (SOEs)  virtually  dominated  in- dustrial  production.  HRM  practices  among these  enterprises  were  embedded  in  the  so- called “iron rice bowl” (tie fan wan) that en- sured  centrally  planned  job  allocation,  life- time  employment,  egalitarian  pay,  and “cradle-to-grave”  welfare  (Ding,  Fields,  & Akhtar, 1997; Warner, 2004). However, over the last two decades, China has experienced phenomenal growth in foreign direct invest- ment  (FDI),  foreign-invested  enterprises (FIEs), and subsidiaries (Warner, 2004).  In 2004, China approved the opening of more  than  43,000  new  foreign-invested  en- terprises,  an  increase  of  6.29%  over  2003, and  the  total  amount  of  foreign  direct  in- vestment  reached  more  than  U.S.  $60  bil- lion, an increase of 13.3% over the previous year  (China  State  Statistics  Bureau,  2005). These economic reforms have brought about unprecedented  changes  in  human  resource management  practices.  The  personnel  re- form legislation of 1992 and the 1994 Labor Law have guided the “three systems reform” that involved the introduction of labor con- tracts,  performance-related  reward  systems, and  contributory  social  security  (Warner, 2004). A new HRM terminology has emerged in joint ventures and multinational corpora- tions that seems to be distinguished from the personnel  management  terminology  of  the pre-reform  era.  Compared  with  the  pre-re- form era, recruitment and selection have be- come more market-oriented, remuneration is increasingly  tied  to  performance,  and  life- time employment is being phased out (Row- ley, Benson, & Warner, 2004).  On  revisiting  human  resource  manage- ment in China, Warner (2004) observed that whereas  in  many  SOEs  conventional  people management continued to be the norm, sub- Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm stantial  changes  were  taking  place  with  re- spect to HRM in large FIEs and wholly owned foreign  enterprises.  In  addition, strategic HRM practices have been introduced  in  giant  SOEs  that have  gone  through  reforms  and have become publicly listed com- panies  (Ding  &  Akhtar,  2001).  In FIEs,  human  resource  managers are  usually  expatriates  or  local Chinese  who  have  gone  through prestigious  business  education programs. These managers are fa- miliar with modern management language and are expected to fol- low the “best practices” in strate- gic HRM, “as exemplified by their own  corporations  internationally or  in  other  MNCs  operating  in Mainland  China.  They  may,  of course,  have  to  adapt  their  prac- tices  to  Chinese  conditions” (Warner, 2004, p. 619). It is clear to us that both local and global competitive pressures are at work in a move toward a convergence in strategic HRM practices in China. Whether or not measures of these practices, as conceptualized in the Anglo-American HRM literature, can be considered to be valid with applicability across different organizations and national settings is an empirical question that we will address in this study. It is clear to us that both local and  global  competitive  pressures are  at  work  in  a  move  toward  a convergence  in  strategic  HRM practices  in  China.  Whether  or not measures of these practices, as conceptualized  in  the  Anglo- American HRM literature, can be considered to be valid with appli- cability across different organiza- tions  and  national  settings  is  an empirical  question  that  we  will address  in  this  study.  In  view  of recent  developments  in  strategic HRM  in  Chinese  enterprises,  we expect that the conceptual struc- ture  of  these  practices,  as  ex- plained  in  Delery  and  Doty’s work  (1996),  will  be  reflected  in an empirically valid structure. How Are Strategic HRM Practices Applied? Strategic  human  resource  man- agement often is viewed as a set of decisions  regarding  the  acquisition,  alloca- tion, utilization, and development of human 18 HUMANRESOURCEMANAGEMENT, Spring 2008 resources that affect organizational perform- ance (Dyer, 1984). In the following sections, we  discuss  the  prevalence  of  Delery  and Doty’s  (1996)  seven  strategic  HRM  practices applied in the Chinese context, and their cur- rent status and development trends.  Workers’ congresses, with trade unions as executive agents, are entitled by law to approve or disapprove of companies’ strategic plans and to have a say in major issues related to the welfare of workers (Ding, Ge, & Warner, 2001). However, the significance of workers’ congresses has declined in recent years. In  a  cross-cultural  study  of managerial  attitudes  about  HRM practices,  Jennings,  Cyr,  and Moore (1995) found that training and development is perceived as the  most  important  strategic HRM  practice  by  managers.  In China,  the  amount  of  invest- ment  in  training  employees varies  widely  across  firms  with different ownership types (Drost, Frayne, Lowe, & Geringer, 2002). In  his  empirical  study,  Zhao (1999)  noted  that  about  half  of the SOEs in his sample allocated a  negligible  amount  of  annual expenditure  on  training,  less than RMB¥30 per employee (U.S. $1 = RMB¥8.07).  On the contrary, in FIEs, sub- stantial amounts have been spent on  training  employees,  since training  is  seen  as  a  critical  and effective  tool  to  ensure  product and service quality and standards. In  multinational  corporations, training is the keystone for local- ization  of  top  and  senior  man- agers.  Trained  Chinese  managers have  successfully  replaced  expa- triate  managers  at  the  corporate and  department  levels.  In  Erics- son China Ltd., for example, out of 12 senior managers at the cor- porate  level,  nine  are  local  Chi- nese. Also, out of 25 department directors,  21  are  Chinese  man- agers (Wenmi Net, 2007). In  FIEs,  it  is  recommended that local managers need to be consulted as the company strives to integrate its corporate culture with Chinese traditions and customs (Yang, 1998). In SOEs, workers’ congresses are traditionally  the  primary  channel  for  em- ployee  involvement  in  management  activi- ties.  Workers’  congresses,  with  trade  unions as executive agents, are entitled by law to ap- prove  or  disapprove  of  companies’  strategic plans  and  to  have  a  say  in  major  issues  re- lated to the welfare of workers (Ding, Ge, & Warner,  2001).  However,  the  significance  of workers’  congresses  has  declined  in  recent years.  In  the  large,  reformed  SOEs,  such  as publicly  listed  firms  (PLFs)  and  joint-stock companies,  employee  representatives  are elected to participate in the meetings of the boards of directors, representing workers and managers in the major corporate decisions.  The  abolition  of  the  “iron  rice  bowl”  is believed to have contributed to the increased labor  productivity  in  Chinese  firms.  How- ever,  in  an  environment  where  almost  all welfare benefits come with full-time employ- ment and where the newly established social security  system  provides  only  minimal  pro- tection, job security has become very impor- tant for all employees.  It has now become a popular practice in Chinese firms that each employee has clearly defined duties, which are evaluated regularly to  determine  his/her  level  of  compensation. Job descriptions are the centerpiece for the so- called “post wage system” (gangwei gongzizhi), which developed from the reward system re- form in Chinese enterprises (for a detailed dis- cussion of the evolution and reform of the re- ward system in Chinese enterprises, see Ding &  Warner,  2001).  The  “post  wage  system”  is composed  of  two  parts:  a  basic  wage  (deter- mined by the intensity and complexity of job duties)  and  a  supplementary  wage  (deter- mined by the accomplishment of job duties). This  system  is  accompanied  by  clear  job  de- scriptions  and  a  strict  performance  appraisal system.  In  recent  years,  the  “post  wage  sys- tem”  has  increasingly  added  elements  of skills  and  capabilities.  The  system  is  called ganwei  jineng  gongzizhi,  and  it  emphasizes clear  job  responsibilities,  professional  skills, and  qualifications,  the  ability  to  innovate, and  results-based  performance  appraisal (Ding & Warner, 2001; Warner, 1995). Performance appraisal in China has been undergoing significant changes since the eco- nomic reforms began in 1978 (Shen, 2004). It is  not  used  just  for  managers’  promotions Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm Strategic HRM Practices and Their Impact on Company Performance 19 and transfers, but for line workers as well. Re- cent research conducted by the Development and  Research  Center  of  the  China  State Council reported that 67.3% of the sampled firms utilize performance appraisal. Of 1,044 enterprises,  the  majority  reported  that  ap- praisal  had  positive  impacts  on  employee performance ranging from moderately effec- tive  to  very  effective.  About  37.2%  of  the sampled firms asserted that performance ap- praisal is not as effective as expected. The rea- sons for the unsatisfactory results of perform- ance  appraisal  include  unclear  performance objectives and evaluation criteria, the lack of feedback  and  two-way  communication,  un- cooperative  attitudes  by  employees  arising from  a  sense  of  being  monitored  and  con- trolled,  and  the  lack  of  a  corresponding  re- ward  and  punishment  system  to  match  ap- praisal results (Guo & Suo, 2005).  In recruiting and retaining qualified pro- fessionals, such as technical, marketing, and managerial staff, providing opportunities for career  and  personal  development  plays  an important  role  in  attracting  young  Chinese holding  graduate  and  postgraduate  degrees (Caplan, 2003). As Chinese society gradually moves  toward  becoming  a  knowledge  soci- ety,  career  management  has  become  an  in- creasingly important part of human resource strategies, especially in the high-tech sector. More and more companies provide opportu- nities  for  development  and  continuous learning in return for high performance and productivity  during  an  employee’s  stay (Larkin, 2005).  The  deteriorating  performance  of  SOEs prompted  the  Chinese  government  to  shift the  focus  of  SOE  reform  to  ownership  and corporate  governance  restructuring  in  the mid-1990s. The main purpose of the owner- ship reform was to improve the efficiency of SOEs through clarification of property rights and relationships with government agencies to reduce day-to-day government administra- tive  intervention  in  the  operations  of  SOEs. An  important  part  of  the  ownership  reform was  employee  ownership  (i.e.,  some  com- pany stock is sold to employees), thus linking the benefits of the employees with company performance. According to a recent report by Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm the  China  State  Council,  owner- ship  reform  increased  the  effi- ciency of SOEs and reduced their financial debt (Deng, 2005). Do Strategic HRM Practices Matter? It  is  one  thing  to  have  strategic HRM  practices  in  place;  it  is  an- other to have such practices make a difference to company perform- ance  in  the  presence  of  strong institutional influences. Some re- searchers  have  argued  that China’s economic, social, and po- litical institutions remain decisive in how firms operate in the coun- try (Peng, 2000). For FIEs to oper- ate  successfully,  the  choice  of local  partners  is  crucial  in  estab- lishing  networks  of  stakeholders (Beamish, 1993), while the mode of entry is constrained by institu- tional  environments  and  firm- government  relations.  Do  these significant institutional forces for firm  performance  imply  that strategic  HRM  practices  do  not matter  in  developing  and  secur- ing competitive advantage?  Law,  Tse,  and  Zhou  (2003) have  argued  that  while  this  may be  the  case  in  formerly  centrally planned  economies  that  are  se- verely  distorted  by  institutional forces, “China’s situation is chang- ing rapidly” (p. 257). Realizing the heavy burden of loss-making SOEs on the country’s nascent financial system,  China  is  actively  reform- ing  large  enterprises  in  the  state sector  with  the  slogan  “grasping the  large”  (Nolan,  2001).  The small  SOEs  are  left  out  and  en- couraged  to  seek  privatization  on their  own.  This  change  is  a  big step forward in the direction of a free  market  economy.  Also, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization  (WTO)  has  further Also, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) has further removed barriers to competition, even in regulated sectors such as telecommunications, banking, and insurance. These indicators of changing situations imply that even though institutional forces may remain potentially influential, enterprises seeking competitive advantage must increasingly rely on internal management processes, including human resource management. 20 HUMANRESOURCEMANAGEMENT, Spring 2008 removed barriers to competition, even in reg- ulated  sectors  such  as  telecommunications, banking,  and  insurance.  These  indicators  of changing  situations  imply  that  even  though institutional  forces  may  remain  potentially influential,  enterprises  seeking  competitive advantage must increasingly rely on internal management processes, including human re- source management. positive and additive effects on company performance across different organizational settings in Anglo- American samples. There is now empirical support to indicate that strategic HRM practices have Barney’s (1991) resource-based theory of the firm often has been used to support the contention that strategic HRM practices may create distinctive competencies as a source of sustained competitive advantage. Not all human capital resources,  however,  lead  to  this end  result  equally.  Human  re- sources that are valuable, rare, dif- ficult  to  imitate,  and  supported by  the  organization  can  lead  to sustained  competitive  advantage (Barney  &  Wright,  1998).  In  the context of a transitional economy such as in China, these resources include  “experienced  and  tal- ented  managers,  qualified  engi- neers  and  technicians,  and  com- petent  marketing  staff”  (Ding  & Akhtar,  2001,  p.  948).  Accord- ingly,  in  this  study,  we  examine the  influence  of  strategic  HRM practices  relating  to  managerial and  professional  employees  on two indexes of company perform- ance:  product/service  perform- ance and financial performance.  There  is  now  empirical  support  to  indi- cate that strategic HRM practices have posi- tive  and  additive  effects  on  company  per- formance  across  different  organizational settings in Anglo-American samples (Arthur, 1994;  Delaney,  1997;  Delery  &  Doty,  1996; Guest,  Michie,  Conway,  &  Sheehan,  2003; Guthrie,  2001;  Huselid,  1995;  Ichniowski  & Shaw, 1999; MacDuffie, 1995). Although sev- eral  studies  have  explained  developments and trends in the HRM field in Chinese en- terprises over the past two decades (Warner, 2004), only a few recent studies have exam- ined  the  linkage  between  HRM  practices  or systems and company performance.  For  instance,  Bjorkman  and  Fan  (2002) conducted a study of 62 manufacturing FIEs and wholly owned foreign subsidiaries. They reported  significant  positive  effects  of  the HRM system and HRM-business alignment on company performance. They created an HRM system  index  based  on  average  standardized scores  on  11  strategic  HRM  practices,  and company performance was measured by man- agerial  assessments  of  satisfaction  with  prof- itability  and  overall  performance.  Similarly, Law  et  al.  (2003)  conducted  a  study  of  122 firms  across  nine  cities  to  test,  among  other things, the effect of the strategic role of HRM on firm productivity and return on equity. Re- porting positive effects on both indexes, they concluded  that  “good  HRM  does  matter  to firm performance in a transitional economy” (Law et al., 2003, p. 263). The present study extends these previous studies by way of ex- amining  individual  effects  of  these  strategic HRM practices on firm performance. Method Sample To  investigate  strategic  HRM  practices  and their impact on firm performance in Chinese firms,  a  large-scale  questionnaire  survey  was conducted in three major cities, Guangzhou, Shanghai,  and  Nanjing.  These  three  cities were selected based on their level of economic openness  and  development.  Guangzhou  is the  capital  city  of  Guangdong  province,  lo- cated in Southern China. Benefiting from its proximity  to  Hong  Kong,  Guangdong province is one of the top destinations for FDI in the country. Shanghai is China’s economic and financial center and has the highest per capita GDP among all Chinese cities. Nanjing is the capital city of Jiangsu province, located along the lower Yangtze River. In comparison with the other two cities, Nanjing is less de- veloped  in  terms  of  GDP  per  capita,  infra- structure,  household  consumption,  and human resource development. We based the sample frame on the China Industrial Enterprises Database, compiled by the  China  State  Statistics  Bureau,  to  cover the  manufacturing  and  service  sectors.  The Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm Strategic HRM Practices and Their Impact on Company Performance 21 manufacturing sector includes a broad range of businesses in electronics, garments, engi- neering  and  chemicals,  and  pharmaceuti- cals. Some enterprises have multiple opera- tions. The service sector includes enterprises in  insurance  and  banking,  import  and  ex- port  trading,  and  retailing  (department stores) and advertising. To solicit participation from the selected enterprises, we contacted the enterprises by telephone  and  through  our  interpersonal networks at local universities. If a particular enterprise  declined  our  invitation,  we  re- placed it with another enterprise in the same industry. We then mailed 600 questionnaires to  these  enterprises  with  the  promise  that their  individual  responses  would  remain confidential.  We  received  465  usable  ques- tionnaires, a response rate of 78.0%.  Table  I  shows  the  characteristics  of  the sample.

Of these enterprises, 37.6% were from Nan- jing, 26.2% were from Shanghai, and the rest were from Guangzhou.  Data Collection The general managers or their deputies responded to the survey on company performance, while human resource directors responded to the strategic HRM We  collected  data  from  multiple  sources  in each enterprise. The general managers or their deputies  responded  to  the  survey on  company  performance,  while human  resource  directors  re- sponded  to  the  strategic  HRM practices  questionnaire.  This  was done  to  match  the  nature  of  in- quiry  with  the  relevant  source  of information on the one hand, and to overcome the simultaneity bias in  the  survey  responses  on  the other.  The  questionnaires  were originally prepared in English and then translated into Chinese by a professional  translator  and  back- translated into English by another professional.  The  back-translated versions  were  compared  with  the originals  to  ensure  accuracy.  The two  questionnaires  are  briefly  de- scribed below. Strategic HRM Practices Questionnaire  This questionnaire elicited information from human  resource  directors  on  background characteristics of the organization and seven strategic  HRM  practices  related  to  internal career  opportunities,  formal  training  sys- tems,  results-oriented  appraisals,  employ- ment  security,  participation,  job  descrip- tions, and profit sharing. We adopted Delery and  Doty’s  (1996)  survey  instrument  to measure  these  practices.  The  instrument contains multi-item scales on seven strategic HRM  practices  except  for  profit  sharing, which  is  based  on  a  single  item.  We  added one item to the profit-sharing scale to make practices questionnaire.  it a multi-item scale. The item was “individ- uals  receive  ownership  shares  as  incentive pay.” Responses to scale items ranged from 1 (not accurate at all) to 4 (very accurate). Survey of Company Performance Consistent with Dyer and Reeves’s (1995) pro- posed  dimensions  of  company  performance, we  used  three  items  each  to  measure  prod- uct/service  performance  and  financial  per- formance.  Items  on  product/service  quality, customer satisfaction, and technological inno- vation measured product/service performance, whereas  items  on  profitability,  sales  growth, and returns on investment measured financial performance. On each item, the general man- agers were asked to compare the performance of their company to the performance of their competitors  for  the  previous  three  years.  Re- sponses  were  obtained  on  a  five-point  scale, ranging  from  1  =  very  low  to  5  =  very  high. Each dimension had a coefficient alpha of .77 in the present study. Results Factorial Validity of Strategic  HRM Practices We  factor-analyzed  the  items  measuring strategic  HRM  practices  (Delery  &  Doty, 1996)  using  principal  component  factor analysis followed by varimax rotation. Table II  shows  that  this  analysis  resulted  in  the seven dimensions of strategic HRM practices accounting  for  64.36%  variance.  Factor  I consists of items that reflect frequency and extensiveness of training programs and the prevalence  of  programs  that  relate  to  skill development  among  new  hires  and  pro- motability  among  existing  employees.  This factor accounted for 12.17% of the variance (α =  .83).  Factor  II  contains  items  on  em- ployee participation in decision making, su- perior-subordinate communication, and op- portunities for suggesting improvements. It explained 11.94% of the variance (α = .81). Factor  III,  which  measures  implicit  and  ex- plicit  policy  on  employment  security,  ac- counted for 9.24% of the variance (α = .73).

Nranged from 406 to 465. Responses were obtained on a four-point scale, ranging from 1 = not at all accurate to 4 = very accurate for the dimensions of strategic HRM practices and on a five-point scale, ranging from 1 = very low to 5 = very high for the dimensions of company performance. Correlations of .10 or more are significant at the .05 level, and correlations of .15 or more are significant at the .01 level. Factor  IV  includes  items  that  indicate  the extent  to  which  job  descriptions  are  com- prehensive,  clear,  specific,  and  up-to-date, explaining  8.30%  of  the  variance  (α =  .66). Factor V represents outcome-based perform- ance  appraisals,  accounting  for  8.16%  of variance (α = .83). Factor VI contains items that reflect the extent to which supervisors recognize career aspirations of their subordi- nates and the extent to which employees are provided with clear career paths and promo- tional  opportunities.  This  factor  explained 7.67% of the variance (α = .64). The last fac- tor, which measures the prevalence of stock ownership and profit sharing, accounted for 6.88% of the variance (α = .70). This factor includes  an  item  on  stock  ownership  that was added by the authors to turn Delery and Doty’s (1996) original single-item scale into a multi-item scale.  Trends of Mean Scores and Correlations Table III presents descriptive statistics on the di- mensions of strategic HRM practices and com- pany performance and the zero-order correla- tions  between  them.  It  can  be  observed  that job descriptions and result-oriented appraisals obtained  relatively  high  mean  scores  of  2.80 and  2.70,  respectively,  whereas  profit  sharing and  employment  security  obtained  relatively low scores of 1.69 and 2.41, respectively. Also, correlations  between  strategic  HRM  practices ranged from –.03 to .56. Profit sharing and em- ployment  security  had  either  weak  or  non- significant  correlations  with  other  strategic HRM  practices,  whereas  training  had  a  sub- stantial correlation. Table  III  further  shows  that  the  mean score  on  product/service  (M = 3.48)  was higher than the mean score on financial per- formance (M = 2.85). The two dimensions of company performance had a moderate corre- lation of .46. Correlations of product/service performance  with  strategic  HRM  practices ranged from .01 to .42, whereas those for fi- nancial performance ranged from .01 to .27. Also,  product/service  performance  and  fi- nancial performance had nonsignificant cor- relations  with  profit  sharing  and  employ- ment security, respectively.  Main Effects on Company Performance We  used  multiple  regression  analysis  to  ex- amine  the  main  effects  of  the  seven  HRM practices  on  financial  and  product/service performance of the company. In the process Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm Strategic HRM Practices and Their Impact on Company Performance 25 of this analysis, we controlled for the effects of company age, size, sector, ownership, and location. Results presented in Table IV show that except for profit sharing, all other strate- gic HRM practices had significant effects on product/service  performance  and  explained 14.0%  of  the  variance.  The  significant  beta coefficients  ranged  from  .09  (p ≤ .05,  one- tailed) for employment security and internal career  opportunities  to  .28  (p ≤ .01,  two- tailed) for training.  Significant  effects  on  financial  perform- ance were limited to training, participation, results-oriented  appraisals,  internal  career opportunities,  and  profit  sharing,  account- ing for 7.0% of the variance. The significant beta  coefficients  ranged  from  .08  (p ≤ .05, one-tailed)  for  results-oriented  appraisals  to .15  (p ≤ .01,  two-tailed)  for  training.  These findings indicate that a set of strategic HRM practices  (training,  participation,  results- oriented  appraisals,  and  internal  career  op- portunities)  affects  both  financial  and product/service  performance.  Employment security  and  job  descriptions  contributed uniquely  to  product/service  performance, whereas profit sharing contributed uniquely to financial performance. Findings Relating to Control Variables Table  IV  shows  that  except  for  ownership and  location,  none  of  the  other  covariates (age,  size,  and  sector)  had  a  significant  ef- fect on product/service performance. Com- pared  with  both  SOEs  and  publicly  owned enterprises, FIEs (β = .18, p ≤ .01, two-tailed) had  better  product/service  performance. However, enterprises located in Guangzhou (β =  –.14,  p ≤ .05,  two-tailed)  had  signifi- cantly  lower  product/service  performance than did those located in Shanghai. Results  presented  in  Table  IV  further show that the size of the enterprise and lo- cation did not significantly contribute to fi- nancial  performance.  However,  enterprises with  combined  product  and  service  opera- tions  had  significantly  lower  profitability compared  with  enterprises  that  were  in  a single  line  business  (β =  –.12,  p ≤ .01,  one- Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm tailed). Age and ownership also significantly influenced this dimension. Older enterprises (β = –.20, p ≤ .01, two-tailed) were likely to have lower financial performance than were younger enterprises. FIEs (β = –.14, p ≤ .05, two-tailed)  were  likely  to  be  outperformed by SOEs in financial performance. It must be noted here that in our sample, most of the FIEs were joint ventures. It is observed that joint ventures experience a high failure rate in the competitive Chinese market (Shenkar & Yan, 2002).  Discussion About the Factorial Validity Results presented in significant effects on product/service performance and explained 14.0% of the variance. Table IV show that except for profit sharing, all other strategic HRM practices had Results  obtained  from  the  ex- ploratory  factor  analysis  shown in Table II suggest that Delery and Doty’s  (1996)  conceptualization of strategic HRM practices has an overall  factorial  validity.  Delery and  Doty  (1996)  derived  these practices  from  the  extant  litera- ture,  observing  that  “we  identi- fied seven practices that are con- sistently  considered  as  strategic HR  practices”  (p.  805).  They  de- fined  strategic  human  resource practices as those that have a the- oretical  or  empirical  bearing  on overall  organizational  perform- ance.  Although  they  did  not  re- port factor analyses in their study, items measuring these practices in the pres- ent study resulted in seven dimensions that clearly  reflected  the  original  conceptualiza- tion.  There  were  no  item  overlaps,  and  all the  dimensions  were  internally  consistent. These  findings  indicate  that  the  strategic HRM  practices  utilized  in  the  present  study can be used with confidence in future stud- ies of Chinese enterprises.  The  apparent  conceptual  convergence  in strategic  HRM  practices  can  be  explained  by the phenomenal change that has taken place in  the  personnel  practices  in  Chinese  enter- prises  since  the  economic  reforms  began  in 1978.

In  the  post-reform  era,  job  security  is not guaranteed. This is reflected in the rela- tively low mean score on employment secu- rity  in  our  sample.  Managers  increasingly are  under  pressure  to  compete  for  limited numbers  of  managerial  positions  as  SOEs streamline their organizational structures to become efficient. Applicants need to have a good  track  record  and  show  evidence  of managerial capabilities and skills in order to remain  in  or  bid  for  new  posi- tions. In Chinese, this phenome- non is called jingzheng shanggang (Cheng,  2005).  Similarly,  in many FIEs, it has become a com- mon practice to demote or to re- place  incompetent  and  nonper- forming  managers  (Yang  & Zhang, 2005). The apparent conceptual convergence in strategic HRM practices can be the  pre-reform  Chinese  economy  was  domi- nated  by  SOEs  and  personnel  practices  were characterized by centrally planned job alloca- tion,  lifetime  employment,  egalitarian  pay, and  “cradle-to-grave”  welfare  (Ding  et  al., 1997; Warner, 2004).  However,  China’s  open-door  economic policy, huge growth in foreign direct invest- ment, proliferation of foreign-invested enter- prises,  the  Labor  Law  of  1994,  accession  to the  WTO,  and  the  like  have  created  condi- tions  conducive  to  adopting  strategic  HRM practices  in  the  relatively  developed  coastal regions  (Warner,  2004).  The  “three  systems reform”  that  involves  the  introduction  of labor  contracts,  performance-related  reward systems, and contributory social security is a good example of the adoption of these HRM practices  (Warner,  2004).  Also,  recruitment and selection have become more market-ori- ented, and lifetime employment is almost a thing of the past (Rowley et al., 2004). Simi- lar  practices  can  be  observed  in  giant  SOEs that  have  successfully  gone  through  the  re- form  process.  In  both  FIEs  and  reformed SOEs,  HRM  managers  are  well  educated  in business  management.  It  is  thus  clear  that there is internal as well as external pressure toward  increasing  convergence  in  strategic HRM practices.  About the Application of  Strategic HRM Table  III  shows  that  the  mean  scores  of  job descriptions  and  results-oriented  perform- ance  appraisals  ranked  first  and  second,  re- spectively.  As  mentioned  previously,  these two  practices  are  key  elements  of  the  so- called  “post  wage  system”  currently  widely used in almost all Chinese enterprises (Ding & Warner, 2001). In the past few years, the Chinese  government  has  been  moving  to- ward  reducing  structural  imbalances  in  its economic sectors by rationalizing and updat- ing its industries. Priority has been given to the  development  of  high-tech  and  high- value-added industries, such as the electron- ics  and  telecommunications  industries.  The “post  wage  system”  has  been  refined  to  in- corporate  elements  of  knowledge,  capabili- Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm explained by the phenomenal change that has taken place in the personnel practices in Chinese enterprises since the economic reforms began in 1978. Our results further show that stock/profit  sharing  has  the  low- est mean score. A possible expla- nation is that stock options as in- centive  pay  for  senior  managers has  been  experimented  with  in only  a  small  number  of  compa- nies.  In  our  sample,  more  than 60% of firms were FIEs, in which profit  sharing  is  rarely  used  to motivate employees. The mean scores for training, participation, and internal career opportunities were in the middle range of the seven strategic HRM practices.  This  shows  that  al- though  Chinese  enterprises  have recognized  the  importance  of  these  three practices,  the  application  of  these  practices has  met  with  some  problems.  For  example, training in most Chinese enterprises is con- strained by the lack of money, and as such, training is almost at the bottom of the prior- ity list in company budgets (Zhao, 1999).  The application of employee participation in  Chinese  enterprises  may  have  been  hin- dered by traditional Chinese values. The Con- fucian  doctrine  of  “maintaining  harmony” advises  that  people  not  cross  their  personal 28 HUMANRESOURCEMANAGEMENT, Spring 2008 boundaries of responsibility or interfere in an- other’s business (yuezudaipao). Consequently, Chinese  managers  tend  to  concentrate  their efforts  on  performing  the  duties  defined  in their  job  descriptions.  It  is  rare  for  Chinese employees to cross boundaries and to take the initiative to give critical feedback and suggest improvements. Therefore, effective employee participation  mechanisms  have  not  been  es- tablished  prevalently  in  Chinese enterprises. However, the situation may  change  gradually,  as  more Chinese firms recognize the bene- fits  of  adopting  employee  partici- pation  (Wang  &  Mobley,  1999). With  their  increasing  education level,  Chinese  employees,  espe- cially  those  returning  from  over- seas with management education, tend  to  embrace  the  concept  of employee  participation  in  man- agement. In the post-reform era, job security is not guaranteed. This is reflected in the relatively low mean score on employment security in our sample. Managers increasingly are under pressure to compete for limited numbers of managerial positions as SOEs streamline their organizational structures to It  also  must  be  noted  that only  a  proportion  of  FIEs  has achieved  a  high  degree  of  local- ization  of  senior  management teams. The career development of local  managers  is  constrained  by limited  opportunity  for  promo- tion and by unclear and blocked career paths (Wong & Law, 1999). In SOEs, streamlining of adminis- trative structures puts heavy pres- sure  on  Chinese  managers  to compete for the reduced number of positions.  About the Impact on Performance become efficient. Although  previous  studies  have used  different  measures  of  firm performance  (Guthrie,  2001;  Har- tog  &  Verburg,  2004;  Huselid,  1995;  Rogg, Schmidt,  Schull,  &  Schmitt,  2001),  the  find- ings of our regression analyses are consistent with the general consensus on a positive link- age between strategic HRM practices and firm performance. In our study, we have identified a set of strategic HRM practices that affect both product/service  performance  and  financial performance. These practices include training, participation,  results-oriented  appraisals,  and internal  career  opportunities.  We  consider these practices as the “core” of strategic HRM in Chinese enterprises because they are com- mon  in  explaining  variance  in  the  two  per- formance  indices.  The  significant  impact  of training on both product/service performance and  financial  performance  confirms  previous studies that training and development is per- ceived as an important strategic HRM practice by managers (Jennings et al., 1995).  With the deepening reform of the reward system  in  China,  a  results-oriented  appraisal system  gradually  has  replaced  the  egalitarian pay  system  that  existed  in  all  Chinese  enter- prises  in  the  pre-reform  era.  The  results-ori- ented appraisal system provides substantial in- centives  for  employees  to  work  hard  to accomplish  their  performance  objectives. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that a re- sults-oriented appraisal system has significant effects on both measures of performance.  Our  findings  on  the  significance  of  the four “core” strategic HRM practices for prod- uct/service  performance  also  are  consistent with the results of a recent study by Shipton, Fay,  West,  Patterson,  and  Birdi  (2005),  who reported a positive linkage between strategic HRM  practices  and  product  innovation. Overall, the four “core” strategic HRM prac- tices provide firm ground for nurturing, in- volving,  motivating,  and  promoting  profes- sional and managerial employees. A practical implication of this finding is that enterprises that have institutionalized these “core” prac- tices  will  have  sustainable  competitive  ad- vantage over the long term. We also found that certain strategic HRM practices have a unique influence on one per- formance measure or the other. Profit sharing significantly  influenced  only  financial  per- formance.  A  possible  explanation  could  be that  managers,  motivated  by  bonuses  based on  company  profits,  tend  to  pursue  short- term profitability. In Chinese enterprises, this dynamic has led to insufficient investment in new  product  and  service  development. Therefore,  we  suggest  that  firms  that  adopt profit-sharing programs should base bonuses not  only  on  profitability,  but  also  on  other Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm Strategic HRM Practices and Their Impact on Company Performance 29 indices—namely, new product development, quality of product and services, and customer satisfaction.  Another  explanation  is  that stock sharing as an important component of ownership reform in China has provided an alternative  means  for  financing  enterprises. Tseo, Sheng, Zhang, and Zhang (2004) found that firms sell company stocks to employees more for new capital financing than for pro- viding incentives to employees. The financial capital  gathered  from  selling  shares  to  em- ployees  provides  much-needed  investment funding, which in turn brings potential prof- itable opportunities to the company. Employment  security  and  job  descrip- tions are two other practices that positively affected  product/service  performance  but not  financial  performance.  In  general,  em- ployment security has declined considerably in the post-reform era of the Chinese econ- omy.  Firms  that  provide  employment  secu- rity create a supportive environment for or- ganizational  innovation  (Shipton  et  al., 2005) and are in a better position to employ committed  professionals  to  enhance  new product and service development.  Finally,  in  Chinese  enterprises,  job  de- scriptions  are  the  key  element  in  perform- ance appraisal and reward determination. In organizations  where  performance  goals  are quantifiable, employees are evaluated by ob- jective  and  quantified  criteria.  On  the  con- trary,  where  performance  goals  are  difficult to quantify, such as product/service perform- ance criteria, clear job descriptions allow em- ployees to understand where their responsi- bilities  lie,  thus  serving  as  a  basis  for accountability and evaluation.  Limitations and Future Research Directions Although this study contributes to HRM re- search,  its  limitations  should  be  acknowl- edged.  First,  we  used  a  perceptual  perform- ance measurement in this study. Specifically, we  used  managerial  perception  of  the  com- pany’s  product/service  performance  and  fi- nancial performance compared with that of their  competitors  for  the  previous  three years. Although the perceptual performance Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm measurement was adopted in previous stud- ies  on  the  HRM  and  performance  relation- ship  (e.g.,  Delaney  &  Huselid,  1996),  it would  still  be  worthwhile  for  future  studies to  investigate  the  influences  of  strategic HRM  on  objective  performance measurements,  such  as  the  ratio of profit to sales, return on assets, and return on equity.  In our study, we Second, we performed regres- sion analysis on a cross-section of data gathered at one time to iden- tify  the  relationship  between strategic  HRM  and  performance. It is important to use some longi- tudinal  data  in  future  studies  to examine  the  causal  link  between strategic  HRM  practices  and  firm performance.  Third,  our  data were  collected  in  three  main cities, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Nanjing. Future research may ex- tend  the  study  to  the  less-devel- oped inland and western regions of  China,  such  as  Chongqing, Chengdu, and Xi’an.  have identified a set of strategic HRM practices that affect both product/service performance and financial performance. These practices include training, participation, results-oriented appraisals, and internal career opportunities. We consider these practices as the Fourth,  our  sample  firms  in- clude  FIEs,  PLFs  on  p.  18,  and SOEs,  and  the  majority  of  them are  FIEs.  Although  FIEs  are  no doubt  the  trendsetters  for  HRM practices  in  Chinese  enterprises, we  should  include  other  owner- ship types of firms in future stud- ies,  especially  considering  the growing  importance  of  private enterprises in China’s economy.  Fifth,  we  adopted  an  organi- zational-level  approach  in  the evaluation of the effectiveness of strategic HRM practices. However, factors at the micro level, such as the  level  and  experience  of  staff and job poaching, will affect the effectiveness  of  strategic  HRM practices. The interactive effects of organiza- tional-level  factors,  such  as  industry  with strategic HRM practices, also must be investi- gated in future studies.  Finally, Chinese managers and employees may differ in their understanding of some of “core” of strategic HRM in Chinese enterprises. 30 HUMANRESOURCEMANAGEMENT, Spring 2008 the practices, such as participation, from their Western counterparts. As the HRM practices of a country are heavily influenced by its culture (Satow & Wang, 1994), another important re- search direction for us is to identify strategic  HRM  practices  with unique Chinese characteristics and determine  if  Chinese  strategic HRM  practices  diverge  from  or converge  with  Western  strategic HRM practices.  have gained The Chinese economy seems to momentum to Conclusion nurture and develop human capital with the purpose of becoming a knowledge economy. The past few years have witnessed dramatic  developments  in  strate- gic HRM practices in Chinese en- terprises.  Not  only  have  FIEs adopted these practices, but large, reformed  SOEs  are  also  in  the forefront  of  making  these changes. Our findings support re- cent assertions by researchers that strategic  HRM  practices  not  only are  widespread,  but  also  are  val- ued by Chinese organizations.  The  Chinese  economy  seems  to  have gained  momentum  to  nurture  and  develop human capital with the purpose of becoming a knowledge economy. A recent trend report issued  by  a  Chinese  social  science  institute (Wang,  2005)  observed  that  future  develop- ments  in  strategic  HRM  would  be  character- ized by treating human resources as organiza- tional capital, emphasizing the management of  employee  knowledge,  skills,  and  capabili- ties;  developing  strong  corporate  culture; making performance appraisals objective and reward systems just and fair; redesigning jobs to  facilitate  career  development;  and  chang- ing the role of the HR function from one of administrative bureaucracy to one of possess- ing  the  strategic  role  of  facilitating  and achieving strategic goals. These characteristics of strategic HRM closely reflect HRM trends in advanced  economies.  We  believe  that  in  a decade  or  two,  with  some  local  adaptations, mainstream  strategic  HRM  will  prevail  in most Chinese organizations. In the highly competitive Chinese market, a  firm’s  success  increasingly  will  rely  on  the quality of its human capital. HR departments will have to design systems that enable their organizations  not  only  to  attract  managerial talent, but also to train, involve, motivate, and reward managers in ways that support organi- zational  strategy.  To  move  in  this  direction, the  four  core  strategic  HRM  practices  identi- fied in our study should be the fundamental constituents in designing these systems.
