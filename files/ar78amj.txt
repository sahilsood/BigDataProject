BUCHHOLZ  Washington University  The relationship between the market performance of a firm's common  stock and its social responsibility has been the subject of contradictory views  in the past. One view is that a socially aware and concerned management  will also possess the requisite skills to run a superior company in the 'tradi-  tional sense of financial performance, thus making its firm an attractive  investment. (The Dreyfus Third Century Fund is based on this view. The  fund invests in companies that not only meet traditional investment criteria,  but which also in their view make contributions to the enhancement of the  quality of life in the U. S. relative to other companies in the same industry. )  This view has been suggested by Moskowitz (1972), who subsequently  attempted to validate it empirically. Moskowitz first selected 14 firms that  possessed what he believed were good social responsibility credentials, and  then calculated the rate of return on their common stock for the first half  of 1972. After noting that the 14 stocks had appreciated an average of 7.28  percent while major market indices such as the Dow-Jones Industrials had  appreciated by much smaller amounts, Moskowitz interpreted these results  as support for his view.  A contradictory view is that socially responsible firms will be at a  competitive disadvantage due to the added expense incurred by such be-  havior. This view has received support in a study by Vance (1975). Vance's  study was based on two surveys previously taken by Business and Society  Review ("How Business School Students .. .," 1972; "Industry Rates Itself,"  1972) where businessmen and students rated 45 and 50 leading firms,  respectively, on their perceived degree of social responsibility. Each of  these surveys yielded a ranking of the firms as to their degree of social  responsibility. (Both surveys indicated a wide range of social responsibility,  as there were firms rated from outstanding to poor.) Using these two rank-  ings, Vance observed a negative correlation between rank and stock market  performance during 1974.  Thus these two studies came to different conclusions regarding social  responsibility and stock market performance. Both, however, have certain  empirical deficiences. First, they evaluated stock performance for only a  479 This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 20:38:33 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  480  Academy of Management Journal  September  short period of time - six months in the Moskowitz study and 12 months  in the Vance study. Second, neither study evaluated stock market per-  formance on a risk-adjusted basis. This study will correct for these defi-  ciences, allowing a more definitive statement to be made regarding the  relationship between social responsibility and stock market performance.  Performance Measurement  When evaluating security returns, it is insufficient to only consider rates  of return. Securities are generally described in terms of two parameters,  return and risk, and it is generally accepted that higher risk securities should  have higher returns than lower risk securities. In evaluating security per-  formance, therefore, it is necessary to incorporate both risk and return in  the analysis.  Jensen (1968) has devised a method for measuring security performance  on a risk-adjusted basis. In involves a regression model based on the Sharpe-  Lintner (Sharpe, 1964; Lintner, 1965) capital asset pricing model:  Rjt - RFt -= aj -+ 3 [Rmt - RFt] + Ejt (1)  where Rjt denotes the rate of return on security j at time t; RFt is the risk-  free rate of return; and Rmrt is the rate of return on the market. Here crj  and /i are the regression parameters with random error term Ejt. The  intercept term at can be interpreted as a measure of stock market per-  formance on a risk-adjusted basis. Frequently called differential return, it  measures the return on security j earned above or below a hypothetical port-  folio of similar risk formed from a linear combination of the market port-  folio and risk-free asset. A positive differential return indicates the security  earned more than the market on a risk-adjusted basis, and a negative  differential return indicates the security earned less than the market on a  risk-adjusted basis. The parameter pj, frequently called the beta coefficient,  can be interpreted as a measure of the risk of security j, with higher values  being associated with higher risk securities.  The Data  The social responsibility rankings used in this study were the same as  those used in the Vance study. The first two columns of Table 1 reflect the  firm rankings. Four of the firms in the two surveys were eliminated from  consideration in this study, as they were mutual life insurance companies  and hence had no common stock. These firms were Equitable Life,  Prudential, Metropolitan Life and John Hancock. Since 40 of the remaining  firms were surveyed by both businessmen and students, the rank order cor-  relation coefficient between the two surveys was calculated. Its value of  .6584 (significantly positive at the .05 level) shows a fairly strong degree  of agreement between the two surveys. Security returns for each of these This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 20:38:33 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1978  Alexander and Buchholz  481  firms were calculated monthly over the five-year period 1970-1974, as  shown by Fama (1976, p. 12), using:  Rjt = (Pt- Pjt- + Djt)/Pjt-1 (2)  where Pit denotes the price of security j at the end of month t and Djt de-  notes all dividends received during month t. (The businessmen survey was  taken in the fall of 1971 and the student survey was taken in the spring of  1972. Since these ranks may change through time, the five-year period 1970-  1974 surrounding the survey dates was chosen for analysis. The three-year  subperiod 1971-1973 was also analyzed.) All prices were adjusted for  stock dividends and splits.  Since (1) was used to measure the differential returns of the securities,  it was necessary to have monthly rates of return on both the market (RMt)  and risk-free asset (RFt). The Standard and Poor's 500 Composite Index  and the 30-day Treasury bill rate respectively, were used for this purpose.  Empirical Results  Differential returns and risk measures of the securities in the social  responsibility surveys were calculated for the five-year sample period 1970-  1974 and a three-year subperiod 1971-1973. As shown in Table 1, few  securities had differential returns significantly different from zero - two  in the five-year period and three in the three-year subperiod. It appears  from this analysis that there is no significant effect of social responsibility  on stock market performance.  The measures of differential return were ranked in descending order over  both the five and three-year periods, and then rank order correlations were  calculated between survey rank and differential return rank. These correla-  tions, shown in Table 2, generally indicate a low insignificant relationship  between risk-adjusted performance and degree of social responsibility.  [Since the measure aj of differential return is an estimate based on the  regression equation (1), it is subject to an errors-in-variables bias (John-  ston, 1972, pp. 281-291). Hence tests of significance using oaj may be  inaccurate, but are reported here for the reader's information. These com-  ments are also applicable to the measure 3j of risk.]  The beta coefficient in (1) can be interpreted as a measure of risk of  the firm. In order to see whether there was a relationship between security  risk level and the degree of social responsibility, rank-order correlations  were calculated between survey rank and beta coefficient rank. As shown  in Table 2, these correlations generally indicate a low insignificant relation-  ship between risk and degree of social responsibility.  An interesting observation in Table 1 involves the correlations reported  for the three and five-year periods analyzed. In certain instances, such as  First National City Bank, the correlation drops as the estimation interval is  shortened. In other instances, such as Ford, the correlation rises. A possible  reason for this, as reported by Blume (1975), is that the betas may change This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 20:38:33 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  Stock Market Performance and Social Responsibility Rank  TABLE 1  ~~~~Stock Market Performance and Social Responsibility Rank~~ h~00  Company Name  Businessmen S  ,tudents 1970-74 1971-73  1970-74 1971-73  Survey Ran  ik Differential Return  Beta Coefficient  Chase Manhattan  First Pennsylvania  IBM  General Electric  Sears Roebuck  Ford  American Telephone  and Telegraph  Bank America  Chemical Bank  General Motors  First National City Bank  Mobil  Standard Oil of Indiana  Chrysler  RCA  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  7  9  10  11  11  11  14  14  8 -.0039 .0053  (-.45) (.45)  2 .0008 .0118  (.08) (1.01)  2 -.0038 -.0009  (-.58) (-.11)  19 .0069 .0098  (1.07) (1.25)  5 .0013 .0020  (.24) (.36)  20 .0055 - .0046  (.71) (-.55)  18 .0054 .0036  (.98) (.56)  5 .0094 .0102  (.96) (1.20)  17 -.0002 -.0076  (-.03) (-.78)  37 -.0045 -.0107  (-.68) (-1.61)  13 .0169 .0284  (1.61) (2.62)*  21 .0042 .0017  (.52) (.17)  33 .0163 .0201  (2.25)* (2.58*)  24 -.0116 -.0090  (- 1.01) (-.72)  9 -.0055 -.0031  (-.57) (-.27)  .6541 .4109  (3.67)* (1.39)  1.0747 .8155  (4.94)* (2.80)*  .7812 .5520  (5.80)* (2.71)*  1.0958 .9157  (8.29)* (4.70)*  .9587 .9156  (8.31)* (6.47)*  .8047 1.1833  (5.07)* (5.72)*  .6110 .4805  (5.35)* (3.01)*  .9427 .3810  (4.71)* (1.81)  1.0228 .9069  (6.28)* (3.72)*  .7568 .9196  (5.56)* (5.55)*  .7587 .2434  (3.54)* (.90)  .7165 .8642  (4.34)* (3.50)*  .6762 .4489  (4.56)* (2.31)*  1.1318 1.5902  (4.82)* (5.10)*  1.2276 1.6851  (6.28)* (5.99)* This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 20:38:33 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  Westinghouse  Exxon  Dupont  Shell  J.

Inclusion of companies such  as First National City Bank and Ford should not bias the results presented  here, as these changes in correlation seem to be fairly evenly distributed,  both in direction and size, throughout the range of survey ranks.  Conclusion  The results of this study indicate that the degree of social responsibility  as measured by the rankings of businessmen and students bears no sig-  nificant relationship to stock market performance. Furthermore, there seems  to be no significant relationship between stock risk levels and degree of  social responsibility. These findings suggest that the interpretations of both  Moskowitz and Vance are invalid.  A possible third view on the relationship between stock market perfor-  mance and social responsibility, consistent with the findings of this study,  assumes that stock markets are efficient, as described by Fama (1970).  In an efficient stock market, new information relevant to the earnings out-  look of a firm is immediately reflected on the current stock price. Thus  any positive or negative effects associated with the degree of social responsi-  bility of a firm are reflected immediately in its stock price. Since a large  majority of the firms sampled in this study had stock returns which were  no different from the market on a risk-adjusted basis, under this view the  effects of the degree of social responsibility on stock prices were either non-  existent or had occurred prior to 1970.
