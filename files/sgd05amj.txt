SHAW University of Kentucky NINA GUPTA JOHN E. DELERY University of Arkansas We propose four alternative predictions regarding the relationship between voluntary turnover and workforce performance and develop the hypothesis that safety and productivity outcomes mediate that relationship. In two intraindustry studies, strong support emerged for curvilinearity: the relationship between voluntary turnover and workforce performance is negative, but it is attenuated as turnover increases. Some modest support for workforce performance as a mediator of the voluntary turnover and financial performance relationship emerged. Implications for organization-level theory and research are addressed. Four different theoretical patterns of the relation- ship between “voluntary turnover,” or quit rates, and organizational performance can be gleaned from the scientific literature. These include the ar- gument that voluntary turnover hurts organiza- tional performance (Osterman, 1987; Penceval, 1972), that at least some level of voluntary turnover is needed and benefits organizational performance (Dalton & Todor, 1979), that the negative effects of voluntary turnover on performance are attenuated as the rate increases (Price, 1977), and that the turnover-performance relationship is contingent on an organization’s human resource investments and inducements (Arthur, 1994; Guthrie, 2001). Thus far, there has been much more theorizing and spec- ulation than systematic empirical testing concern- ing the veracity of these alternative conceptualiza- tions. As Alexander, Bloom, and Nuchols noted, “There have been almost no empirical studies of the organizational consequences of turnover that This research was funded by the National Science Foundation (SBR-9422326; Study 1) and the Society for Human Resource Management Foundation (Study 2). The interpretations and conclusions in this paper are the authors’ and do not necessarily represent the funding organizations. An earlier version was presented at the 2002 meeting of the Academy of Management, in Denver.

We take steps in this direction here. Platt advocated the “method of multiple hypoth- eses” (1964: 350) for addressing alternative expla- nations empirically. Simultaneous tests of alterna- tive hypotheses about the relationship between voluntary turnover and organizational performance may advance understanding of this relationship and firm performance in general. Such tests may also be useful to inform managers’ decisions about the implementation of human resources manage- ment (HRM) inducements and the investments nec- essary to achieve desired turnover rates (e.g., Abel- son & Baysinger, 1984; Dalton & Todor, 1979; Shaw, Delery, Jenkins, & Gupta, 1998). In essence, such a study has the potential for broad utility, both theoretically and practically. We derive predictions for intermediate workforce performance mea- sures— operationally defined as the organization- level outcomes of the behaviors (i.e., productivity and safety) of key employee groups. We also derive predictions for financial performance measures. First, we elaborate the four alternative theories on the voluntary turnover–workforce performance re- lationship. Second, we address “black box” issues by predicting that the relationship between volun- tary turnover rates and financial performance is mediated by intermediate measures of workforce performance (e.g., Becker & Gerhart, 1996; Delery & Shaw, 2001). Third, we describe tests of the predic- tions in two intraindustry studies, conducted in the 50 2005 Shaw, Gupta, and Delery 51 trucking and concrete pipe industries. Fourth, we discuss the implications of the findings. Our research was limited to core employee groups in each setting—that is, truck drivers and production workers. Core groups control produc- tion processes, deliver hands-on services, and op- erate key technology (Alexander et al., 1994; Delery & Shaw, 2001), factors central to determining the consequences of voluntary turnover. We focus on voluntary turnover exclusively, not on the sum of quit and discharge rates, since the etiology and consequences of these phenomena vary (e.g., Oster- man, 1987; Shaw et al., 1998). Our theoretical pre- dictions derive primarily from human capital the- ory, theoretical approaches (e.g., social capital theory) that are more applicable to knowledge-based organizations and top management groups (e.g., Dess & Shaw, 2001). exclusion of other to the VOLUNTARY TURNOVER AND WORKFORCE PERFORMANCE: FOUR THEORETICAL ALTERNATIVES Alternative 1: The Linear Negative Relationship Human capital theory provides a formal platform for examining the voluntary turnover–workforce performance relationship. It suggests that the accu- mulation of firm-specific human capital embodied in a workforce determines workforce performance (Strober, 1990). Voluntary turnover eliminates an organization’s return on its investment in an em- ployee (that is, it results in the loss of a productive worker). Employees bear costs initially by accept- ing wages below their marginal revenue product in anticipation of high future wages, a return on in- vestment not realized if the employees quit. An organization’s firm-specific human capital accu- mulations are depleted by voluntary turnover, and because firm-specific human capital is an anteced- ent of workforce performance, it should decline as turnover increases. In terms of productivity, by re- ducing firm-specific skill levels, high voluntary turnover disrupts the input-throughput-output pro- cess in an organization and thereby reduces effi- ciency (Alexander et al., 1994). In terms of safety, high voluntary turnover redirects energy and re- sources away from maintenance and safety con- cerns to those necessary for simply sustaining product or service delivery (Staw, 1980). From limited and mostly indirect evidence, Os- terman (1987) concluded that a negative relation- ship between voluntary turnover and workforce performance was fairly well established. In the most direct test of the relationship reported in the literature, Brown and Medoff (1978) found a signif- icant, negative relationship between quit rates and productivity, when initial labor quality, technol- ogy, and unionization were controlled for. In re- lated evidence, voluntary turnover has been found to relate negatively to cost effectiveness in hospi- tals (Alexander et al., 1994), to profit per loan in financial services subunits (McElroy, Morrow, & Rude, 2001), and to sales performance in fast-food restaurants (Kacmar, Andrews, Van Rooy, Steil- berg, & Cerrone, 2004). Overall, this perspective and limited empirical evidence suggest that volun- tary turnover, by reducing firm-specific human capital, relates negatively to workforce perfor- mance. More formally, Hypothesis 1a. There is a significant, negative relationship between voluntary turnover and workforce performance. Alternative 2: The Inverted U-Shaped Relationship Dalton and Todor (1979) questioned whether the effects of voluntary turnover on workforce perfor- mance are always negative. They outlined instead an “expanded and positive perspective” (Dalton & Todor, 1979: 225) representing a variation on hu- man capital arguments, but also departing from purely cost-based assessments of the negative ef- fects of turnover. Although the general effects of voluntary turnover on workforce performance are considered negative, these authors detail the bene- fits of some minimum level of turnover for such performance. In this perspective (as in human cap- ital theory in general), high voluntary turnover is detrimental for workforce performance. At low to moderate levels, however, voluntary turnover can improve workforce performance by revitalization— that is, by increasing workforce innovation, flexi- bility, and adaptability (Abelson & Baysinger, 1984; Dalton & Todor, 1979). Very low quit rates can result in workforce skill stagnation, closed-mind- edness, and “trained incapacity” (Dalton & Todor, 1979; Dubin, 1970) that in the aggregate reduce organizational productivity and increase accidents. A comparison of the Dalton and Todor (1979) formulation and Hypothesis 1a shows that both predict a negative effect of turnover on productivity at high turnover levels. The predictions differ at low to moderate turnover levels. Hypothesis 1a suggests that any increment in voluntary turnover reduces firm-specific skill and experience levels in a workforce and thus lowers its performance. The second formulation posits that, because stagnation or trained incapacity is likely when voluntary turn- 52 Academy of Management Journal February over is low, some turnover is functional—some “changing of the guard” can enhance performance. Empirical evidence on the validity of this alterna- tive formulation is very sparse. Osterman (1987) referred to three studies that examined this rela- tionship, one of a basketball team, one of a kibbutz, and one of a single group of scientists, but he cau- tioned against generalization to organizational set- tings. Recently, Glebbeek and Bax (2004) found support for an inverted U-shaped relationship with total turnover and net sales among subunits of a temporary employment agency but warned about applicability to cross-organization situations. Be- tween-organization tests of this proposition are needed. Thus: Hypothesis 1b. The relationship between vol- untary turnover and workforce performance is curvilinear: it is positive as voluntary turnover increases initially but becomes negative as turnover further increases. Alternative 3: The Attenuated Negative Relationship A third variation on the human capital theory foundation for the relationship between voluntary turnover and workforce performance builds on the sociological literature on turnover and on learning curve theory. On the basis of a review of the turn- over literature, Price proposed that “successively higher amounts of turnover will be found ulti- mately to produce, more often than not, succes- sively lower amounts of effectiveness at a decreas- ing rate” (1977: 119). Voluntary turnover affects workforce performance negatively by diminishing firm-specific human capital accumulations, but these losses are less severe, and their performance effects are ameliorated at high levels of turnover. With low turnover, the firm-specific human capital accumulations of average employees are quite high; a quit means that the organization, on average, is losing an employee who has “progressed down the learning curve.” Like theory on firm-specific hu- man capital, learning curve theory concerns skill and ability levels as they relate to reduced perfor- mance errors and high job-related memory retrieval (e.g., Logan, 1992; Ohlsson, 1986)—that is, they concern employee ability to perform at a level higher than that possible with simply an accumu- lation of general skills. When turnover is low, it is quite time-consuming for a new employee to build specific human capital that is equivalent to the average stayer’s. When voluntary turnover is high, average firm-specific human capital accumulations are low by definition. Replacements can build equivalent human capital and attain the level of performance of leavers quickly. Thus, when volun- tary turnover rates are high, an organization typi- cally replaces a short-tenured employee (with few firm-specific skills) with a new employee who soon represents the same level of human capital accu- mulation and shows equivalent performance. This formulation can also be viewed through the lens of organizational control. As voluntary turn- over reduces skill levels, input-throughput-output processes are disrupted, and an organization di- rects energy and resources away from safety con- cerns in order to maintain operations. When turn- over is very high, however, the organization is geared toward continual workforce replacement, and increases in voluntary turnover beyond some point are minimally disruptive. When the work- force is being constantly replaced (for example, the turnover rate is 100 percent), marginal increases in voluntary turnover (such as to 110 percent) are proportionally less problematic in terms of produc- tivity and safety than increases at lower average turnover rates (e.g., from 10 to 20 percent). Price’s (1977) formulation has two primary dif- ferences from the negative linear formulation. The linear formulation relies on an assumption of a constant loss of firm-specific human capital across the range of voluntary turnover and a consistently negative effect on performance. By contrast, this curvilinear formulation suggests a stronger nega- tive effect on performance than the linear formula- tion when quit rates increase from low to moderate levels (when most of the firm-specific human cap- ital is lost) and weaker or attenuated effects as quit rates continue to increase (when little firm-specific human capital is lost). This argument implies that a linear formulation underestimates the effects of quit rates at low levels and overestimates the effects at high levels. This is also not the reverse of Hy- pothesis 1b. Hypothesis 1b predicts performance benefits for low turnover, but the attenuated nega- tive relationship approach does not predict marked performance improvement for high turnover. The prediction is not for a sharp U-shaped relationship, but rather for a “floor” with a predominantly neg- ative slope. Hypothesis 1c. The relationship between vol- untary turnover and workforce performance is curvilinear and is such that the relationship is generally negative and is attentuated as turn- over rates rise. Alternative 4: The HRM-Moderated Relationship A fourth perspective on the relationship between voluntary turnover and workforce performance is 2005 Shaw, Gupta, and Delery 53 found in the strategic HRM literature. In this view, the consequences of turnover for workforce perfor- mance vary as a function of investments in HRM practices (Arthur, 1994). Of particular importance are those HRM practices that ensure a high-quality human capital pool, termed investments, and those that enhance retention, termed inducements (Shaw et al., 1998). Investment-oriented HRM practices are those, like training, that directly contribute to human capital accumulations over time, and those, like job stability, that indirectly do so. These prac- tices also contribute directly to the firm-specific nature of employee skills by increasing knowledge of an organization’s products or services and spe- cific work processes, technologies, and techniques (Batt, 2002). Inducement-oriented HRM practices include direct practices, such as high pay and ben- efits, and indirect practices, such as procedural justice and voice mechanisms (e.g., Freeman & Medoff, 1984; Shaw et al., 1998). Arthur (1994) argued that HRM systems moder- ate the relationship between turnover and work- force performance in such a way that the relation- ship would be stronger among organizations whose HRM systems were characterized by the use of inducement- and investment-oriented HRM prac- tices, labeled “commitment systems.” High volun- tary turnover disrupts input-throughput-output processes more in organizations where HRM in- vestments and inducements are high than it does in those where these are low. In “high-commitment organizations,” employees play more pivotal or critical roles, whereas in organizations character- ized by low investment in inducement and invest- ment practices (“control systems”), employees are treated more like replaceable commodities (Guth- rie, 2001). Thus, the relationship between volun- tary turnover and workforce performance should be significant and negative when HRM inducements and investments are high, and thus when quits may create great disruptions. By contrast, the voluntary turnover–workforce relationship should be attenuated when inducements and in- vestments are low, because this approach mini- mizes the impact of labor on the process (Guthrie, 2001). Research offers scanty evidence in support of this prediction, notably Arthur’s (1994) study of steel “minimills” and Guthrie’s (2001) replication of that work among organizations in New Zealand. Thus: performance Hypothesis 1d. A negative relationship be- tween voluntary turnover and workforce per- formance is moderated by HRM inducements and investments in such a way that it is atten- uated when HRM inducements and invest- ments are low. Figure 1 (Hypotheses 1a–1c) and Figure 2 (Hy- pothesis 1d) depict these alternative conceptualiza- tions of the relationship between voluntary turn- over and workforce performance. VOLUNTARY TURNOVER AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: WORKFORCE PERFORMANCE AS A MEDIATOR Researchers have recently called for theoretical elaboration of the black box area that lies between organizational practices, strategy implementation, and workforce characteristics on the one hand and the ultimate financial performance of organizations on the other (e.g., Becker & Gerhart, 1996; Delery & Shaw, 2001). We expect workforce performance to mediate the relationship between voluntary turn- over and financial performance. Implicit in the der- ivation of Hypotheses 1a–1d is that voluntary turn- over to workforce performance outcomes (although the form of the relationship is an open theoretical and empirical question), but that lower workforce performance levels will be manifested in lower profitability levels. Huselid (1995), for example, reported significant, negative correlations between total turnover and productiv- ity and small, positive correlations between pro- ductivity and financial performance, but he did not examine a mediation framework. relate rates The nature of the mediation is contingent upon the results from the alternative hypotheses outlined above: that is, work force performance may mediate a direct linear relationship, a curvilinear relation- ship, or a relationship moderated by HRM prac- tices. We anticipate only partial mediation of the effects of voluntary turnover by workforce perfor- mance. Voluntary turnover could affect financial performance directly in many ways. For example, such turnover could increase administrative inten- sity and other costs in addition to lowering work- force performance (e.g., see Alexander et al., 1994). The interaction of voluntary turnover and HRM practices could influence financial performance di- rectly through a trade-off whereby the harmful ef- fects of turnover “are just matched by the wage, hiring, and training costs associated with that turn- over rate” (Pencavel, 1972: 57). The interaction could also affect financial performance directly, since voluntary turnover–HRM practice mis- matches are likely to lower profits (Osterman, 1987). Thus, we expect the relationship between voluntary turnover and financial performance to be 54 Academy of Management Journal February Alternative Forms of the Relationship of Voluntary Turnover and Workforce Performance FIGURE 1 The HRM-Moderated Relationship of Voluntary Turnover and Workforce Performance FIGURE 2 2005 Shaw, Gupta, and Delery 55 partially mediated by workforce performance. Stated formally: substantive independent and dependent measures for Study 1. Hypothesis 2a. The direct relationship between voluntary turnover and financial performance (a negative linear relationship, an inverted U- shaped relationship, or an attenuated negative relationship) is partially mediated by work- force performance. Hypothesis 2b. The relationship between the interaction of voluntary turnover and HRM practices and financial performance is par- tially mediated by workforce performance. STUDY 1: METHODS Sample This was a facility-level study of the 202 member plants of the American Concrete Pipe Association (ACPA) in the United States and Canada in 1995. After extensive prior contacts, plant managers were mailed a lengthy survey dealing with HRM, pro- duction and operations, and effectiveness. Com- pleted responses from 141 facilities represented a 71 percent response rate. Missing data reduced the analysis sample to 110, or a 54 percent effective response rate. All measures referred to the core employee group, production employees. We took several steps to minimize error and to increase the reliability of key informant reports (Wright et al., 2001). We focused on a single industry, small es- tablishments, and the core occupational group (production workers), defined as the largest group of nonmanagerial employees (Batt, 2002). We de- termined the most knowledgeable informant in each firm and instructed this individual to com- plete the survey or to have others complete sections for which they were more knowledgeable. We con- ducted extensive site visits to develop and pretest the measurement instruments and to identify lan- guage and phrasing unique to the industry. The test of our human capital hypotheses required a setting in which firm-specific human capital, rather than general skills, was important. Concrete pipe facili- ties are rare (there are typically one or two plants in a major U.S. metropolitan area), and the production of concrete pipe is vastly different and more com- plicated than the production of “ready-mix” con- crete. As a result, the skills and abilities needed for high performance in the concrete pipe industry tend to be more sophisticated than those needed in other concrete facilities. They are also nontransfer- able, or firm-specific, because machines in concrete pipe plants are customized. The setting, then, ap- peared adequate for testing predictions based on human capital theory. The Appendix details all the Independent Variables Voluntary turnover. Respondents provided in- formation on the number of employees who quit in 1995 and the average number of production work- ers employed in 1995. The ratio of the two compo- nents formed the measure. HRM inducement and investment index. The five HRM investments and inducements from the Shaw et al. (1998) framework (pay level, benefits level, job stability, training, and procedural justice) were used to form the index. Law, Wong, and Mo- bley (1998) referred to this type of measure as an aggregate from five dimensions. Each HRM practice is a separate dimension that causes the level of the composite, unlike in traditional scale scores, where the assumption is that the underlying conceptual variable causes scores on a measure. We combined the dimensions linearly since the components were assumed to be substitutable. For instance, induce- ments/investments would be equivalent in an or- ganization offering high pay and high benefits only and in an organization offering high pay and high job stability only. These organizations would have the same level on the HRM index, both conceptu- ally and operationally. Pay level was measured as the average annual pay for production workers in a facility. Benefits level was the percentage of health insurance premi- ums paid by the company. Job stability consisted of the average of two items (␣ ⫽.83; 1, “strongly dis- agree,” 7, “strongly agree” for this and other invest- ments and inducements items) regarding layoff prevalence; one of these was, “We give production workers other assignments during slow times.” Training was the mean of six items assessing the extensiveness of training opportunities for produc- tion employees (␣ ⫽.85). A sample item was, “We give our production employees extensive training.” Procedural justice was assessed with three items (␣ ⫽.64). A sample item was, “Our company has for- mal procedures to ensure that workers are treated fairly.” The index standardized and averaged scores from the five measures. The reliability of the linear composite, found using the formula from Nunnally and Bernstein (1994), was .69. Dependent Variables: Workforce Performance A measure of financial performance was not available and, thus, only Hypotheses 1a–1d were tested here. Two measures of workforce perfor- mance were available. Labor hour per ton is a com- 56 Academy of Management Journal February mon productivity measure in heavy manufacturing (e.g., Arthur, 1994). It is the number of labor hours worked by production employees in a focal year divided by the tons of concrete products produced in the same year. We derived this measure from respondent reports by multiplying the number of production employees during average, peak, and slow months by the number of regular working hours in these months (assuming a 40-hour work- week). We then added in average number of over- time hours worked per employee during these pe- riods. This total was then divided by the tons of concrete products produced. Fewer labor hours per ton indicates better performance. Key informant reports of labor hours per ton correspond well with archival measures (Arthur, 1994). Our second performance measure, accident rates, is a common way of assessing workforce per- formance in the concrete pipe industry. This vari- able was measured as the number of “lost-time accidents” in the plant in the last five years divided by the number of production employees. A lower accident rate indicates better performance. Control Variables We drew on organization-level research on vol- untary turnover (e.g., Alexander et al., 1994; Shaw et al., 1998) and strategic HRM (e.g., Arthur, 1994; Dean & Snell, 1991) in developing a set of control variables: facility size and age, corporate depen- dence, unionization, technology, and work interde- pendence. This set of controls was designed to account for factors shown to relate to voluntary turnover and performance across industries as well as for industry-specific factors that might be re- sponsible for observed relationships. Facility size is related to administrative complexity, turnover, and productivity (e.g., Shaw et al., 1998). It was mea- sured as the natural logarithm of the number of production workers in a plant. Facility age is a proxy for founding values and is related to volun- tary turnover (e.g., Arthur, 1994). It was measured as 1995 minus the founding date of a facility. Cor- porate dependence can influence performance, vol- untary turnover, and strategic alignment (Dean & Snell, 1991). Plants that were part of multiplant corporations were coded 1, and free-standing plants, 0. Unionization is related to HRM practices, voluntary turnover, and performance (Arthur, 1994; Freeman & Medoff, 1984; Shaw et al., 1998). This variable was coded 1 if production workers were covered by a collective bargaining agreement and 0 otherwise. We controlled for machine auto- mation, which is an indicator of technological so- phistication because a facility’s physical equip- ment (packer-head and other dry-cast pipe-making machines in this case) may be associated with pro- ductivity and turnover rates (Arthur, 1994). Re- spondents rated each machine as having no auto- mation (coded 1), partial automation (2), or full automation (3); the average automation level formed the measure. Work interdependence can also influence turnover and workforce perfor- mance. In concrete pipe production, sequential in- terdependence is a constant across plants. It is thus necessary to control for variations in interdepen- dence beyond that required by constant sequential interdependence. Two controls were included. The first was a three-item scale (␣ ⫽ .78) capturing variations in the use of advanced manufacturing technology; that is, process technologies that in- crease integration and hence interdependence in a manufacturing process (Dean & Snell, 1991). The second control was a seven-item scale (␣ ⫽ .89) for the use of work teams (defined in the survey as “teams that cut across functions to work on quality issues”) beyond that required by the production sequence. Another important control was initial labor quality (Osterman, 1987), as this variable can affect the relationship between turnover and per- formance. In our study, the HRM index was a proxy for the quality of a labor pool, in that facilities that invest more in pay, benefits, training, job security, and procedural justice should have higher initial labor quality than others (Arthur, 1994). Analytic Approach Hierarchical regression analyses were used to test the hypotheses (Cohen, Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2003). We computed regression equations by enter- ing control variables in step 1, the HRM index and voluntary turnover in step 2 (the test of Hypothesis 1a), turnover squared in step 3 (the test of Hypoth- eses 1b and 1c), and the voluntary turnover by HRM index product term in the final step (the test of Hypothesis 1d). We standardized voluntary turn- over before computing the squared and interaction terms to reduce nonessential multicollinearity (Co- hen et al., 2003). Tests for violations of the assump- tions of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression re- vealed no major violations in the equations. STUDY 1: RESULTS Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for, and correlations among, all the variables in Study 1. Table 2 reports the regression analyses and tests of Hypotheses 1a–1d. The values in the table are un- standardized regression coefficients. For labor 2005 Shaw, Gupta, and Delery 57 block block hours per ton, Table 2 shows that the set of control variables (⌬R2 ⫽ .12, p ⬍ .05) explained a sig- nificant amount of variance, but the second step, which included the HRM index and voluntary turnover, did not (⌬R2 ⫽ .01, n.s.). The linear voluntary turnover term in step 2 was not signifi- cant and, thus, Hypothesis 1a was not supported. The third step, containing the quadratic turnover term, was significant (b ⫽ ⫺0.23, p ⬍ .01) and explained an additional 4 percent of variance. To support Hypothesis 1b, productivity should in- crease as turnover increases initially, but it should be negative thereafter. To support Hypothesis 1c, the relationship should be negative and decelerate as voluntary turnover increases. Recall also that a sharply U-shaped relationship would not support Hypothesis 1c. ⫹ b4 To understand this relationship, we used the equation from Cohen et al. (2003) to solve for the zero-slope point on the curve. The appropriate for- mula is ⫺(b1 ⫻ HRM index)/(2 ⫻ b2), where b1 is the coefficient for the linear turnover term and b2 is the coefficient for the squared turnover term. This equation reduces to ⫺b1/(2 ⫻ b2) or ⫺.79/(2 ⫻ ⫺.23) because the HRM index has a mean of zero. The predicted turning point of the curve was at 1.71 standard deviations (s.d.’s) from the mean, which represents voluntary turnover of approxi- mately 55 percent. Figure 3 graphs this attenuated relationship. The relationship between voluntary turnover and workforce performance is sharply negative initially (recall that higher labor hours per ton indicates lower performance), but it is attenu- ated as turnover rises. To illustrate, we predicted an increase in labor hours per ton across facilities of 197 percent (from 0.45 to 1.34) as voluntary turnover increased from 0 percent to mean levels; an increase of only 41 percent from the mean to ⫹1 s.d.; of 5 percent from ⫹1 to ⫹2 s.d.’s; a zero slope at ⫹1.7 standard deviations. Thus, the relationship conforms to the prediction that “successively higher amounts of turnover will be found ulti- mately to produce, more often than not, succes- sively lower amounts of effectiveness at a decreas- ing rate” (Price, 1977: 119; emphasis added) and supports Hypothesis 1c for labor hours per ton. No support was found for Hypothesis 1d, as the inter- action of the HRM index and voluntary turnover did not predict labor hours per ton (b ⫽ ⫺0.19, n.s.). For accident rate, the control variables explained 9 percent of the variation (n.s.), and the second step, an additional 5 percent. The quadratic turn- over term in step 3 was significant (b ⫽ ⫺0.04, p ⬍ .05), explaining 4percent of the variance. Since the quadratic term provides a better fit, the significance of the linear term in step 2 does not support Hy- pothesis 1a. The turning point was 1.8 standard deviations from the mean. That is, the relationship between voluntary turnover and accident rate in this sample diminishes as turnover increases and falls to a zero slope at a turnover of 57 percent. A plot of this relationship, presented in Figure 4, shows that the predicted number of accidents per employee is .05 when the turnover rate is zero. The predicted rate is .21 accidents per employee at mean turnover levels (an increase of 340 percent). Accident rates increase by 49.9 percent from the mean to ⫹1 s.d.’s, and only by 8 percent between ⫹1 and ⫹2 s.d.’s. The curve flattens at 1.82 s.d.’s and increases only slightly thereafter. Thus, Hy- pothesis 1c is supported in the equation for time lost to accidents. No support was found for Hypoth- esis 1d, as the interaction of the HRM index and voluntary turnover was not significant.

When companies that used owner- operators exclusively and those that had gone out of business after publication of the 1999 Blue Book 2005 Shaw, Gupta, and Delery FIGURE 4 Study 1: Attenuated Negative Relationship between Voluntary Turnover and Workforce Performance in Predicting Accident Rate 59 were excluded, 1,041 companies remained. We mailed questionnaires after initial contact with an encouraging letter and a phone call. Nonrespon- dents were sent a second questionnaire six weeks later. Completed questionnaires were returned from 380 organizations, a response of 37 percent. Missing data reduced the analysis sample to 299, giving us an effective 29 percent response rate. We focused on a core occupational group (drivers), identified the managerial informant most knowl- edgeable about the drivers at each company, and conducted extensive site visits to develop and pre- test the measurement instruments. As in Study 1, an adequate test of our human capital– based pre- dictions required a setting in which firm-specific skills were important. In the trucking industry, drivers are hired with the requisite general skills (e.g., commercial licenses) and therefore typically acquire only firm-specific skills (e.g., operation of customized routing systems) after being hired. Thus, losses through voluntary turnover include not only the easily replaceable general skills, but also additional operational and administrative skills that are specific and important to the partic- ular organization. Two archival data sources were also used. The first was the Blue Book, which contains organiza- tional and financial information that motor carriers file with the federal government. The second was the SAFER database, available on-line, which in- cludes two-year running totals of accidents, inspec- tion violations, and other information that motor carriers file with the Federal Highway Administra- tion Office of Motor Carriers (FHWA). Blue Book information was obtained for the two years follow- ing questionnaire administration, 2000 and 2001. SAFER data were obtained to correspond precisely to this time frame (i.e., for 2000 – 01). The Appen- dix details all substantive independent and depen- dent measures for Study 2. Measures: Independent Variables Voluntary turnover. Respondents provided in- formation on the number of company drivers who had quit in the past year and the average number of company drivers during the year. We calculated the ratio of quits to total drivers to represent voluntary turnover. HRM inducement and investment index. The aggregated composite was assessed with the same five HRM practices we used in Study 1. Pay level was measured as the average annual pay for the typical driver in an organization. Benefits level was the percentage of health insurance premiums for drivers paid by a company. Job stability was the averaged response on two items (1, “strongly dis- agree,” 7, “strongly agree”; ␣ ⫽ .71). One of the 60 Academy of Management Journal February items was, “We have systems in place to guarantee work for our drivers.” Training was the mean num- ber of hours per year that drivers were provided formal, organization-specific training in the follow- ing areas: computer skills, maintenance skills, and interpersonal skills. Procedural justice was as- sessed with five items (1, “strongly disagree,” 7, “strongly agree”; ␣⫽ .81); an example item is, “Our company has formal procedures to ensure that driv- ers are treated fairly.” The index was the average of the standardized scores from the five measures. The reliability for the composite, per Nunnally and Bernstein’s (1994) formula, was .77. Dependent Variables Workforce performance. Three measures were used. The first, a common measure of productivity, was the amount of revenue generated per employee (revenue per driver). The numerator, the average gross freight revenue for 2000 and 2001, was ob- tained from the Blue Book. The denominator was the total number of drivers employed by an organi- zation, as reported in the questionnaire. A second measure of workforce performance, out-of-service percentage, was obtained from SAFER for the two- year (2000 – 01) period. Motor carriers are subject to various random and regular inspections by federal and state transportation authorities. Violators of federal and state regulations pertaining to equip- ment or drivers (e.g., log book violations) are often removed from service until the violation is reme- died. Our measure was specific to driver perfor- mance in the aggregate, showing the frequency of violations attributable to driver mistakes, and did not include factors beyond the drivers’ control (e.g., poor equipment). This variable was assessed as the number of trucks or drivers taken out of service owing to driver fault, divided by the total number of inspections times 100. We calculated a third measure, accident frequency ratio, using informa- tion from the Blue Book and SAFER databases. This variable is defined as accidents per million miles driven. Total accidents for 2000 – 01 (SAFER) were divided by total miles driven for the same period (Blue Book) and multiplied by 1,000,000. Financial performance. Two measures from the Blue Book were used. Operating ratio was defined as total operating expenses divided by total gross revenue times 100. Return on equity (ROE) indi- cates profit on invested capital and is often used in strategic HRM research (e.g., Delery & Doty, 1996). It is defined as net income divided by total equity. Both variables were calculated as the 2000 and 2001 calendar year average. Control Variables Our choice of control variables in Study 2 fol- lowed the same logic applied in Study 1; thus, we assessed variables related to voluntary turnover and performance in prior research (size, age, unionization), industry-specific confounds and technology (carrier type, tractor age, percentage of owner-operators), and social capital confounds (percentage of drivers in teams/relays). Size was the natural logarithm of the total number of em- ployees, as reported by the respondent for a com- pany; age was 2000 minus the founding year, as reported in the Blue Book; and unionization was the percentage of drivers covered by collective bar- gaining agreements, as reported by the respondent. Turnover and performance vary by industry seg- ment (Shaw et al., 1998), and so we controlled for carrier type, measured as truckload and specialized commodity carriers (coded 1) and less-than-truck- load (LTL) carriers (0). Average tractor age served as a proxy for technology. Percentage of owner- operators, included because their use may relate to turnover and revenues, was the percentage of total “line-hauls” and “over-the-road runs” completed by owner-operators. To account for the effects of interdependence and social capital losses, we con- trolled for the average percentage of drivers who drive in teams and relays. Analysis The tests of Hypotheses 1a–1d paralleled the ap- proach used in Study 1. Hypotheses 2a–2b were tested using the mediation procedures outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986). The voluntary turnover variable was standardized prior to computation of the squared and interaction terms. Tests for viola- tions of the assumptions of OLS regression analysis revealed no major violations in the equations. STUDY 2: RESULTS Response Bias Checks We used data from the Blue Book and logistic regressions to compare the characteristics of re- sponding and nonresponding organizations. We compared nonresponders (coded 0) to responders (coded 1) on an array of organizational and operat- ing characteristics: carrier type, total fringe benefits cost, total highway miles driven, total wages paid, average haul (in miles), total insurance costs, cur- rent assets, company age, tons per mile, and aver- age load (in tons). None of the independent vari- ables were significant in this equation. 2005 Shaw, Gupta, and Delery 61 Regression Analyses Table 3 shows correlations and descriptive sta- tistics for the variables in Study 2. The results of the analyses for workforce performance (Hypothe- ses 1a–1d) are shown in Table 4. Steps 2 and 3 of the regression equation contain the information for the tests of Hypotheses 1a–1d. In step 2, voluntary turnover was significantly and negatively related to revenue per driver (b ⫽ ⫺26.98, p ⬍ .05), but the quadratic turnover term is also significant in step 3 (b ⫽ 5.77, p ⬍ .01; ⌬R2 block ⫽ .02, p ⬍ .01). Thus, the relationship appears to be curvilinear, and Hypothesis 1a is not supported. A plot revealed a pattern consistent with Hypothesis 1c: the relationship between voluntary turnover and revenue per driver is negative but becomes attenuated as turnover increases. Using the same turning point formula applied in Study 1, we cal- culated the turning point on the equation to be 1.6 s.d.’s from the mean, or a rate of 102 percent. The predicted loss in revenue that will occur going from no voluntary turnover to the mean level of turnover is 10.6 percent ($21,000 per driver). The predicted loss going from mean voluntary turnover to one standard deviation above the mean is 7.1 percent (or $12,000 per driver), and the predicted loss as turnover moves from ⫹1 to ⫹2 standard deviations is less than 1 percent, or only $1,255 per driver. Thus, Hypothesis 1c is supported. The test of Hypothesis 1d is found in step 4. The product of voluntary turnover and the HRM index was not significant, and thus Hypothesis 1d was not sup- ported. For the accident frequency ratio, as Table 4 shows, the quadratic term in step 3 (b ⫽ ⫺0.08, p ⬍ .01) was significant, explaining an additional 2 per- cent of the variance. The form was again supportive of Hypothesis 1c. The zero slope point was at a quit rate of ⫹1.8 standard deviations, or an estimated rate of 110 percent. The predicted increase for the comparison between a company with no voluntary turnover and the mean organization is 63 percent; the increase from the mean to one standard devia- tion above the mean is 25 percent, and from ⫹1 to ⫹2 s.d.’s, the increase is only 5 percent. These results support Hypothesis 1c. The interaction of the HRM index and voluntary turnover was not significant, offering no support for Hypothesis 1d. The third set of results in Table 4 concerns out- of-service percentage equations. Once again, the quadratic term on step 3 (b ⫽ ⫺0.85, p ⬍ .01) was significant, explaining an additional 3 percent of variation in the equation beyond that explained by the controls and the linear term. The curvilinear relationship was consistent with Hypothesis 1c; performance declined, but at a diminishing rate, as turnover increased. The unstandardized coeffi- cients yielded a turning point at a turnover of 2.4 standard deviations (132%) from the mean. Consis- tently with Hypothesis 1c, there is a predicted in- crease of 202.88 percent in the out-of-service per- centage as turnover increases from none to the mean, and an increase of 49.6 percent in out-of- service as turnover goes one standard deviation higher. But as turnover increases from one to two standard deviations above the mean, there is only a 15.7 percent increase in the out-of-service percent- Correlations and Descriptive Statistics for All Variables, Study 2a TABLE 3 Variable Mean s.d. n 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 0.99 371 4.77 36.77 10.14 373 ⫺.06 8.91 27.33 369 .01 2.76 364 3.69 .05 0.31 376 ⫺.13** 0.89 10.05 24.13 368 1.

The interaction of voluntary turnover and the HRM index was not significant in predicting the out-of-service percentage. Hypothesis 2a concerns whether workforce per- formance mediates the relationship between vol- untary turnover and financial performance, and Hypothesis 2b concerns whether workforce perfor- mance mediates the interaction of HRM induce- ments and investments, voluntary turnover, and financial performance. We tested these possibilities using the steps outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986). Four conditions must be met for mediation to be established here: (1) Voluntary turnover (Hy- pothesis 2a) or the interaction of the HRM index and voluntary turnover (Hypothesis 2b) must be related to the mediating variables; this was estab- lished only for the attenuated negative relationship for all three workforce performance outcomes (Ta- ble 4). (2) The workforce performance mediators and financial performance outcomes must be re- lated. (3) Voluntary turnover must be related to financial performance. (4) The effect of voluntary turnover on financial performance should fall to zero (full mediation) or be reduced (partial media- tion) when mediators are entered. As noted, the first step in the process was estab- lished with the results reported in Table 4. We calculated partial correlations between the vari- ables for workforce performance and financial per- formance to address the second step. Holding con- stant the set of controls, we found that neither revenue per driver (partial r ⫽ ⫺.03, n.s.) nor the accident frequency ratio (partial r ⫽.09, n.s.) was related to the operating ratio, but the out-of-service percentage was significantly and positively related (partial r ⫽.18, p ⬍ .01). The same pattern emerged for ROE. The out-of-service percentage was signif- icantly related (partial r ⫽ ⫺.13, p ⬍ .01) to volun- tary turnover, but no significant relationships were found for revenue per driver (partial r ⫽ .03, n.s.) or the accident frequency ratio (partial r ⫽ ⫺.02, n.s.). Thus, according to the Baron and Kenny (1986) guidelines, only the out-of-service percentage was a potential mediator between voluntary turnover and financial performance, and only the third and fourth steps were pursued for this measure. the quadratic turnover Table 5 shows the results of the mediated regres- sion analysis. To address the third criterion, we regressed the operating ratio and ROE on the inde- pendent variables. For the negative attenuated ef- fect to be mediated by the out-of-service percent- age, term should be significantly related to the financial performance outcomes but should be reduced when the out-of- service percentage is entered. Step 3 shows that the quadratic term is significant (b ⫽ ⫺0.25, p ⬍ .01) in a direction consistent with the floor effect hypoth- esis.

The Sobel test (see Baron & Kenny, 1986) revealed that the reduction was sig- nificant at the .05 level. Thus, Hypothesis 2a, pos- iting mediation by the out-of-service percentage in the operating ratio equation, receives some support. The results for ROE are shown on the right side of Table 5. In these equations, there is no significant direct relationship between voluntary turnover and ROE, although the voluntary turnover and HRM index interaction is significant (b ⫽ ⫺4.24, p ⬍ .05). The pattern, when plotted, is such that the relationship between voluntary turnover and ROE is significant and negative when the HRM index is high, but nonsignificant when the HRM index is low. Although the out-of-service percentage is also related to ROE (b ⫽ ⫺1.03, p ⬍ .01), no mediation is evident, as the interaction did not relate to the out-of-service percentage. Thus, no support was found for Hypotheses 2a and 2b in the ROE equation. DISCUSSION In these studies, we tried to begin unraveling the “black box dynamics” of interaction among organi- zational turnover, HRM, and organizational perfor- mance. We found that voluntary turnover was sig- nificantly related to workforce performance levels, but not in a simple linear fashion. Rather, across five dependent variables and two industrial set- tings, we found that the negative effects of volun- tary turnover on workforce performance were at- tenuated as voluntary turnover rates rose. We also found some support for the argument that work- force performance mediated the relationship of vol- untary turnover and financial performance. The re- sults are useful because they distinguish among alternative theoretical variations of human capital theory (Platt, 1964), focus on key blue-collar em- ployees in two industries, involve a variety of data sources, and involve data obtained over time. Our results and their implications for science and prac- tice are discussed below. We tested four variations of human capital theory arguments regarding the relationship between vol- untary turnover and workforce performance: that the relationship is negative and linear; that it has an inverted U-shape; that it is negative but attenuated at higher voluntary turnover rates; and that it is moderated by HRM practices. The results consis- tently support a curvilinear pattern in which the effects of turnover on workforce performance are very strong when turnover is low but weaken as turnover increases. As human capital theory sug- gests, quits indeed deprive an organization of the skills and abilities necessary for high performance among the workforce, but beyond a certain point, increases in quit rates are not incrementally ero- sive. That is, since average firm-specific human 64 Academy of Management Journal February capital accumulations diminish as voluntary turn- over increases, the incremental effect of turnover on workforce performance is less severe. Compared to the curvilinear formulation supported in these studies, a linear formulation would underestimate the relationship with workforce performance as voluntary turnover increases from low to mean lev- els, but overestimate the negative effects as rates increase beyond mean levels. Our results in terms of productivity, accident rates, and revenue also reveal the significant, practical implications of this distinction. In our research, Hypothesis 1a (linear negative relationship) was circumscribed by the results, but Hypotheses 1b (inverted U) and 1d (moderated) were not supported. Dalton and Todor’s (1979) for- mulation has received little empirical support in the literature. A rare exception is the work of Glebbeek and Bax (2004), who found an inverted U-shaped relationship among units of a single or- ganization. There are various explanations for the inconsistency between Glebbeek and Bax’s results and those of our study and prior research in gen- eral. One, of course, is that the former is a single- organization study, not necessarily applicable to our cross-organization design. A second explana- tion lies in the nature of the measures used. For their measure of turnover, Glebbeek and Bax used the number of leavers during a year divided by the average number of workers an organization had during that same year. This variable presumably measures total turnover, which combines quits and discharges. Taking the view that quits and dis- charges can be distinct phenomena (Shaw et al., 1998), we focused on quits exclusively. Another explanation is the potential situation-specificity of the Dalton and Todor (1979) and Abelson and Baysinger (1984) formulations. The human capital issues—trained incapacity and stagnation—under- lying the inverted-U proposition may be more rel- evant at some locations in an organization than others. For instance, these issues may be relevant among top managers who are responsible for stra- tegic direction and decisions involving environ- mental risk, but not among blue-collar production workers. Stagnation and trained incapacity may also be more germane for knowledge-based workers than for drivers and production workers doing more predictable activities. Our data precluded a test of situation-specificity, but this explanation merits further exploration. Another variation of human capital theory to re- ceive no support was that HRM inducements and investments moderate the relationship of quit rates and workforce performance, a general proposition that has been supported in other research (Arthur, 1994; Guthrie, 2001). Perhaps, again, the difference in the measures used in the cited work and the current study—total turnover versus quits— ex- plains these differences. Another possibility is that a quadratic relationship was evident, but not tested, in the cited studies. Cohen and his coau- thors showed that when a true relationship is cur- vilinear and a linear interaction with moderately to highly correlated cross-product terms is “mistak- enly estimated in the sample, a significant interac- tion can potentially be detected” (2003: 299). A third explanation is that our HRM index, which was patterned after Shaw and colleagues (1998), incorporated variables predictive of retention, not financial performance. This index should overlap with that measuring high-performance work prac- tices (Delery & Doty, 1996), but an index specifi- cally designed to capture high-performance work practices might have fared better. We hope that future research disentangles whether the discrep- ancies between previous research and ours are sub- stantive or artifactual. We investigated whether workforce performance mediated the relationship of voluntary turnover and financial performance in Study 2 with two measures of financial performance: operating ratio and return on equity. There was, at best, limited support for the mediation argument. We detected no mediation with respect to ROE but found some support with respect to the out-of-service percent- age mediating the relationship of voluntary turn- over and the operating ratio. Full rather than partial mediation was evident. In many ways, even this limited support is encouraging, because complex higher-order effects are difficult to detect in gen- eral, and this difficulty is compounded when a more elaborate mediation model is involved. That we observed a floor-effect curvilinear relationship between voluntary turnover and a financial perfor- mance outcome (operating ratio) that was mediated by the out-of-service percentage perhaps implies the presence of a strong underlying effect. On the other hand, that the effects were not evident across all measures of work performance and financial performance could imply that the support is seren- dipitous and data-specific. Taken together, the results raise many interesting possibilities for further work on these issues, and they point to some cautions and constraints as well. The discovery of this particular curvilinear rela- tionship between voluntary turnover and work- force performance highlights the importance of ex- amining nonlinear and nonadditive functions in exploring human resources management and or- ganizational effectiveness. It would be useful to replicate this curvilinear function in different sam- 2005 Shaw, Gupta, and Delery 65 ples and to incorporate a broader array of dysfunc- tional employee behaviors (e.g., absenteeism, tardi- ness, substance use). Further, although Dalton and Todor’s (1979) general propositions were not sup- ported here, it is still important to study functional/ dysfunctional turnover issues systematically at the organizational level. Is turnover higher among bet- ter performers than among poorer performers? High performance signifies more human capital; strong performers are also likely to have better alternative employment opportunities. In individual-level re- search, the relationship between performance lev- els and decisions to quit has typically had an in- verted U-shape—that is, both strong performers and poor performers decide to quit more frequently than do average performers (e.g.,Trevor, Gerhart, & Boudreau, 1997; Williams & Livingstone, 1994)— but such patterns at the organizational level must be determined. The three-way dynamics of HRM practices, quit rates, and employee performance also need study. As an anonymous reviewer pointed out, individual pay-for-performance pro- grams, if implemented and administered appropri- ately, should reduce quitting among good perform- ers but should increase it among poor (and, possibly, among average) performers. Shaw and Gupta (2002) reported some support for these rela- tionships, but only when pay was highly dispersed across employees and when information about their organization’s pay-for-performance system was communicated well to them. But it is not known whether similar patterns play out for vari- ous HRM practices. The central focus of our study was human capital issues, but turnover also results in loss of social capital. Our investigations entailed settings in which social capital variations are min- imal, making social capital issues less relevant. The dynamics of social capital and its impact on per- formance and turnover have been elucidated con- ceptually (e.g., Adler & Kwon, 2002; Dess & Shaw, 2001) and tested empirically in a recent study (Shaw, Duffy, Johnson, & Lockhart, 2003), but fur- ther empirical work in settings with rich social capital is essential. Our results must be viewed in light of some lim- itations. Study 1 involved cross-sectional data from a single source, an organizational key informant, highlighting issues of common method variance, response consistency, informant accuracy or reli- ability, and causal reciprocity. The reliability of key informant reports is the subject of much debate (Wright et al., 2001), and despite our efforts to reduce problems, the results should be interpreted with caution. Even in Study 2, where there was temporal lag, reverse causality or reciprocal effects are of potential concern. It may be that high work- force and financial performance are manifested in lower voluntary turnover rates—people are less likely to quit better, more productive organizations. Better-performing organizations may offer better working conditions, a share in profits, and/or a more satisfying performance-oriented culture that result in lower turnover. Thus, although our theory suggests a certain causal pattern, we cannot rule out the possibility of reverse or reciprocation cau- sation. Some support for our causal logic is found in Glebbeek and Bax (2004), where significant as- sociations were found only when turnover mea- sures preceded performance measures. The authors concluded that performance “may indeed be seen as being influenced by turnover and not the cause of turnover” (Glebbeek & Bax, 2004: 15). Future research should develop stronger research designs able to tease out potential reciprocal effects. Our study was confined to two industries and two key jobs, raising generalizability concerns. Although our results can be generalized cautiously to blue- collar or skilled-trade settings where interdepen- dence is low, the specific turnover-performance re- lationship may be affected by requisite skill levels, learning curves, and more. Even if an attenuated negative relationship were widely observed across settings, the rate of attenuation may vary with in- terdependence, social capital, skill dictates, or other factors. The alternative hypotheses were gen- erally based on variations of human capital theory, which requires a consideration of the firm-specific- ity of skills. We argued that firm-specific skills were relevant in both industries but had no direct information on the balance of general and firm- specific skills in the sample. The results in both studies belie the argument that only general skills are lost through turnover, because human capital theory would predict a nonsignificant relationship between turnover and performance under these conditions. Despite this result, we encourage future researchers to try to replicate our findings in differ- ent industrial contexts or to include direct assess- ments of general and firm-specific skill losses from employee quits. Finally, our results may be ex- plained by unmeasured variables (e.g., absence rates, workforce age; [Glebbeek & Bax, 2004]) or other confounds. We used controls commonly found in the turnover and strategic HRM literature as well as a set of industry-, technology-, and social capital– based controls, but other, unmeasured fac- tors may have biased our results. Offsetting these concerns are certain method- ological elements here: we focused on higher-order effects, which are less subject to common method explanations than other effects, and we replicated the workforce performance results in Study 2 with 66 Academy of Management Journal February data from archival sources and time-lagged depen- dent variables. In terms of generalizability, strong and consistent results were obtained across two studies, two different types of performance mea- sures, and two key employee groups. The support across two settings speaks to the robustness of our results. Some cautious generalizations to other blue-collar settings where human capital accumu- lations are deemed important are probably war- ranted. Data in Study 2 were obtained from key informants and two distinct archival sources, elim- inating concerns about common method variance while confirming results from Study 1. Other as- pects of our design also bolster confidence in the substance of the results. This was an organization- level analysis of a large sample of companies in one industry (trucking) and of a sample that included more than half of the total population of plants in another (concrete pipe). We held the focal job con- stant in both studies and controlled for factors that can contaminate observed relationships. Perhaps the major contribution of this study is that, following Platt (1964), we pitted predictions from four alternative variations of the same theme (human capital theory) and examined these empir- ically. We hope future research adopts this ap- proach more frequently in resolving theoretical conflicts. The resulting consistent curvilinear pat- tern validates a variation on human capital theory arguments initially proposed by Price (1977). There was also limited support for the argument that workforce performance mediates the relationship between quit rates and financial performance. This study thus moves research toward a better under- standing of voluntary turnover–performance dy- namics. REFERENCES Abelson, M. A., & Baysinger, B. D. 1984.

Voluntary Turnover The number of production employees who quit in 1995 divided by the average number of production em- ployees. HRM Inducement and Investment Index Pay level: The average hourly rate for production em- ployees times 2000. Benefits level: The percent of health insurance premi- ums paid by the company. Job stability: We give production workers other as- signments during slow times. We lay production workers off when business is slow (reversed) Training: We give our production employees exten- sive training. We keep track of how effective our training programs are. Each production employees must go through formal training from time to time. Our employees get a lot of training after we hire them. We measure how well our training programs work. We continue to train our employees for as long as they work for us. Procedural justice: Our company has formal proce- dures to ensure that our workers are treated fairly. We rule on disputes only after we investigate all sides of the issue thoroughly. Production employees have a chance to answer any complaints made against them. Labor Hours per Ton The number of labor hours worked by production em- ployees in 1995 divided by the tons of concrete products produced. 68 Academy of Management Journal February Accident Rate Out-of-Service Percentage The number of lost-time accidents in the last five years divided by the average number of production employees. The number of trucks/drivers taken out of service in 2000 and 2001 after inspection divided by the total num- ber of inspections. (SAFER) Study 2 Accident Frequency Ratio The source of each variable appears in parentheses after its description. Total accidents for 2000 and 2001 (SAFER) divided by total miles driven for 2000 and 2001 (Blue Book) times 1,000,000. Voluntary Turnover Operating Ratio The number of drivers who quit in the past year di- vided by the average number of drivers. (questionnaire) Total operating expenses divided by total gross reve- nue times 100 (average of 2000 and 2001; Blue Book) HRM Inducement and Investment Index All data were from the questionnaire. Pay level: The average annual pay for a typical driver. Benefits level: The percent of driver health insurance premiums paid by the company. Job stability: We guarantee our drivers a certain amount of work in every pay period. We have systems in place to guarantee work for our drivers. Training: About how many hours of formal training does a typical driver receive each year in the following areas? (computer skills, maintenance skills, interper- sonal skills) Procedural justice: We have formal systems in place to ensure that our drivers are treated fairly. Drivers can always give “their side of the story” when complaints are made about their driving performance. Drivers always have a chance to answer any complaint against them. Management always asks for drivers’ opinions before making decisions that affect them. We rule on disputes about drivers only after investi- gating the issue thoroughly. Formal procedures are in place to address any driver grievances. Revenue per Driver Average of gross freight revenue for 2000 and 2001 (Blue Book) divided by the total number of drivers. Return on Equity Net income divided by total equity (average of 2000 and 2001; Blue Book) Jason D.
