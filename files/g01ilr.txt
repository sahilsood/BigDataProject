HIGH PERFORMANCE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF WORK? THE IMPLICATIONS OF ALTERNATIVE WORK PRACTICES FOR THE EXPERIENCE AND OUTCOMES OF WORK JOHN GODARD* Using data from a 1997 telephone survey of 508 employed Canadians, the  author  explores  the  implications  for  workers  of  alternative  work practices (AWPs) associated with the high-performance model.  There are three main findings.  First, moderate levels of AWP adoption were associated with increased “belongingness,” empowerment, task involve- ment, and ultimately job satisfaction, esteem, commitment, and citizen- ship behavior.  At higher levels of adoption, however, these associations declined in magnitude and even became negative.  AWP adoption was also associated with more stressful work.  Second, whereas traditional (that  is,  supervised)  group  or  team  systems  represented  a  substantial improvement over individualized work arrangements, “lean” and “team” forms of work organization associated with the high-performance model did not.  Third, although team-based work and information sharing had positive  effects,  team  autonomy  and  responsibility  for  a  good  or  ser- vice—both associated with the high-performance model—had negative effects,  as  did  “Just-in-Time”  (JIT)  systems  and  re-engineering  pro- grams. C onsiderable attention has been paid to alternative work practices (AWPs) as- sociated  with  the  “high-performance” model  of  organizations.    These  practices *John Godard is Professor at the I. H. Asper School of  Business,  the  University  of  Manitoba.

They are generally viewed as representing al- ternatives to the individualized work ar- rangements  commonly  associated  with work  organizations  in  the  postwar  era, arrangements that are believed by many to have negative consequences for both Copies of the research instrument, raw data, and data analysis are available from the author.

Many AWPs are not particu- larly  new    (Godard  and  Delaney  2000). But  a  considerable  literature  has  sug- gested that they have become more wide- spread  (Osterman  2000),  potentially transforming both how employees expe- rience their work and various social and psychological  outcomes  associated  with this experience. The  high-performance  thesis  under- pinning the adoption of these AWPs has been developed at a time when unions in the United States are severely weakened and there is little prospect for labor law reforms that could reverse this weakness. In  the  field  of  industrial  relations,  this has  meant  that  scholars  have  searched for  an  alternative  trajectory  through which both “equity” and “efficiency” can be achieved.  According to the high-per- formance thesis, AWPs may offer such a trajectory, improving the quality of work- ing life for employees while yielding per- formance  gains  for  employers.    What seems to make them attractive to propo- nents is the belief that they represent a largely  voluntaristic  solution,  requiring few  institutional  changes  beyond  those necessary  to  eliminate  barriers  to  their adoption  (for  example,  Cappelli  and Rogovsky 1998).  Yet although there has been considerable research assessing the implications of AWPs for employer out- comes,  proponents  have  only  recently begun  to  address  their  implications  for workers—despite  a  belief  among  more critical scholars that these are often nega- tive (see Godard and Delaney 2000). In  this  paper  I  analyze  data  from  a 1997 telephone survey of 508 employed Canadians to address these implications. I seek to establish whether AWPs’ impli- cations  for  workers  are  mainly  negative or,  as  proponents  appear  to  assume, mainly  positive.    Though  implemented in a variety of forms and often not clearly defined  (Wood  1999;  Godard  and Delaney  2000),  these  alternative  work practices  are  for  present  purposes  con- sidered to generally include1 some com- bination of work re-organization (for ex- ample, autonomous work teams, job ro- tation, and multi-skilling) and formal par- ticipatory  mechanisms  (for  example, quality circles and town hall meetings), often  implemented  in  the  context  of  a quality  management,  work  re-engineer- ing,  or  lean  production  program,  and supported  by  performance-based  pay systems. Under  the  high-performance  model, AWPs are complemented by a variety of human resource management practices— among them, sophisticated selection pro- cedures,  intensive  training,  a  no-layoff policy, and reductions in pay and status differentials  (for  example,  Pfeffer 1998:64–98).  These practices may mod- erate the implications of AWPs.  For ex- ample,  intensive  training  may  enhance workers’  ability  to  solve  problems,  thus reducing  stress  that  might  arise  from enhanced responsibilities associated with AWPs.  However, this paper is concerned only  with  the  implications  of  AWPs  for workers  given  the  way  AWPs  have  been implemented, not with how AWPs should be implemented.  Whether and how AWPs can be complemented so as to maximize their positive effects for workers is a sepa- rate  issue  addressed  in  subsequent  re- search (Godard 2001a). AWPs and the High-Performance Model:  Issues and Debates Proponents of AWPs generally seem to assume that, where properly implemented, AWPs have positive implications for work- ers  (for  example,  Ichniowski  et  al.  1996; Kochan and Osterman 1994; Pfeffer 1998; 1Although AWPs are typically assumed to operate in part through task enrichment and enhanced par- ticipation,  this  paper  is  specifically  focused  on  the implications of AWPs and does not attempt to address the  broader  and  more  complex  literature  on  job redesign or participatory decision-making. 778 INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW Kochan  2000).    The  reasons  for  this  are often not clearly stated, but the literature on  work  design  has  long  suggested  that employees  are  likely  to  be  more  highly motivated and committed to their work to the extent that social-psychological needs are  fulfilled,  and  proponents  appear  to assume that this represents a major conse- quence of AWPs (see Cappelli and Rogovsky 1998).    Extending  this  argument,  Adler (1993) has argued that even where AWPs do  not  change  the  content  of  work  itself (for example, as under Japanese-style lean production), they engender team partici- pation, and this in turn helps foster respon- sibility and commitment, ostensibly because employees have a greater sense of belong- ing  and  identification.    Moreover,  AWPs are believed to complement one another. Thus, they are more effective to the extent that  they  are  adopted  in  combination (Ichniowski et al. 1997). The arguments and assumptions of pro- ponents have not gone unchallenged.  Criti- cal scholars have maintained that any posi- tive effects of AWPs are typically limited to managerial outcomes and obtained at the expense of employees, through an intensi- fication of the work process and “manage- ment by stress” (for example, Turnbull 1988; Parker and Slaughter 1995; Delbridge and Turnbull 1992; Wells 1993).  Others, how- ever, have argued that much depends on how AWPs are adopted, particularly whether employers  adopt  the  “commitment”  or “socio-technical”  approach  they  associate with  “team”  organization  rather  than  the “control” or “low cost” approach they asso- ciate with “lean” organization (for example, Berggren 1992; Matthews 1994; Boreham, Hall, and Harley 1996; Shaiken, Lopez, and Mankita  1997).    The  former  is  typically portrayed  as  relying  extensively  on  truly autonomous  teams  performing  enriched tasks  and  on  various  employee  participa- tion mechanisms; the latter, as having few changes  in  authority  relations  or  in  the actual content of work, instead focusing on cost-cutting and intensification of the work process.  Thus, while the former has posi- tive implications for workers, the latter has negative ones. Research findings have been mixed.  On the one hand, a number of qualitative stud- ies suggest that some of the concerns about AWPs  may  be  supported.    For  example, Barker (1993:434) concluded that autono- mous work teams, considered central to the high-performance model, give rise to what he  labels  as  “concertive”  control,  under which  peer  pressure  and  group  perfor- mance norms create “a new iron cage whose bars are almost invisible to the workers it incarcerates.”    In  a  study  of  a  Japanese transplant, Graham (1993) found that work was fragmented and intensified, with little empowerment, and that it also engendered considerable  individual  and  collective  re- sistance from workers.  Taplin (1996) found evidence that new forms of work organiza- tion in the U.S. apparel industry are predi- cated on routinization and work intensifi- cation.  A number of quantitative studies also  lend  support  for  these  and  related concerns, finding that AWPs are associated with high work intensity, stress, and fatigue (Fucini and Fucini 1990; Lewchuck et al. 1997; Rinehart et al. 1997; Landsbergis et al.  1999),  and  that  workplaces  with  AWP programs  are  more  likely  to  have  layoffs (Osterman 2000). On the other hand, there is an extensive body of research claiming positive implica- tions for job enrichment and for participa- tory  decision  processes  (see  Miller  and Monge  1986;  Ganster  and  Fusilier  1989), two mechanisms through which proponents typically believe AWPs operate.  A number of studies have also found positive effects for  specific  AWPs  (for  example,  quality circles).  Specific AWPs have been found to be positively associated with commitment (Cordery et al. 1991), satisfaction (Kemp et al.  1983),  and  organizational  citizenship behavior  (Cappelli  and  Rogovsky  1998), and  negatively  associated  with  absentee- ism, minor accidents, grievances, and quits (Havlovic 1991).  However, the findings of these latter studies have tended to be weak. In addition, a number of studies have found either  mixed  or  limited  effects  (Batt  and Appelbaum  1995;  Berg  et  al.  1996).    In some cases, observed effects appear to re- flect job characteristics often associated HIGH PERFORMANCE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF WORK? 779 with AWPs but that can vary considerably independently  of  them  (Wall  et  al.  1986; Appelbaum et al. 2000).2  The findings of the broader literature on participative de- cision-making  have  also  been  called  into question,  with  critics  arguing  that  it  has failed  to  demonstrate  noteworthy  effects (Wagner  1994;  Locke,  Alavi,  and  Wagner 1997). There  are  three  possible  explanations for the unevenness of these findings.  First, individual studies have commonly been lim- ited  to  one  or  a  few  workplaces  (for  ex- ample, Brockner and Hess 1986; Havlovic 1991; Tesluk and Vance 1996; Rinehart et al. 1997), so their findings may reflect cir- cumstances  unique  to  these  workplaces. Second, numerous studies have addressed the  effects  of  one  or  a  few  specific  AWPs (usually  autonomous  teams  or  quality circles) without controlling for other AWPs, thereby potentially “contaminating” their results (Brockner and Hess 1986; Wall et al. 1986).    These  studies  have  also  not  ad- dressed the effects of entire systems of AWPs on  workers,  even  though  the  combined effects of AWPs have been the main focus of 2Perhaps most noteworthy is the Appelbaum et al. (2000)  study  of  4,400  workers  from  44  plants  in  3 industries:    steel,  apparel,  and  medical  electronic instruments  and  imaging.    The  authors  concluded that  the  AWPs  included  in  their  study  on  balance appeared to have positive implications for trust, com- mitment,  and  satisfaction,  and  no  implications  for stress  levels.    Yet  the  results  varied  considerably  by industry  and  dependent  variable,  and  the  authors included only four measures of reforms:  autonomy in decision-making, communication with others outside one’s work area, membership in a self-directed team, and membership in an off-line team.  The first two of these  measures  have  always  varied  considerably  in workplaces, and high levels can occur in the absence of  a  high-performance  work  program.    Thus,  the results for these measures cannot be interpreted as reflecting the effects of high-performance practices per se.  This is especially so given that their effects are explored after controlling for the two team measures. Yet autonomy in decision-making had by far the stron- gest observed effects.  The team measures, which may be the only true measures of reforms, made very little difference, and where they did, their signs were nega- tive almost as often as they were positive. the  high-performance  literature  (for  ex- ample,  Appelbaum  et  al.  2000).    Third, those studies that have focused on the ef- fects of an entire system of AWPs have been unable to establish whether and how these effects vary depending on program charac- teristics  or  the  configuration  of  AWPs adopted (Berg et al. 1996; Lewchuk et al. 1997).  In some cases, they have only estab- lished what it is like to work in workplaces with AWP programs, lacking a comparison workplace without these programs (for ex- ample, Babson 1993; Rinehart et al. 1997). A further problem has been a tendency for much of the relevant research to focus on outcomes considered important to or- ganizational  performance  and  hence  of concern to management.  Such outcomes include job satisfaction, commitment, and, more  recently,  organizational  citizenship behavior  (for  example,  Griffin  1991; Cappelli and Rogovsky 1998).  These out- comes are no doubt relevant to understand- ing  how  AWPs  affect  workers.    But  they provide only limited insight into the impli- cations of AWPs for the actual experience of work or for extra-work outcomes. Researchers have shown little interest in the possible implications of AWPs for worker alienation  and  mental  health,  despite  an extensive tradition addressing these topics in sociology.  Blauner (1964), for example, identified  four  dimensions  of  alienation: “isolatedness,” meaninglessness, estrange- ment, and powerlessness.  He argued that these  dimensions  had  increased  with  the growth  of  individualized  or  mass  produc- tion work, but that they could be expected to decline as more advanced technologies became  more  pervasive—in  part  because work  is  more  complex,  is  done  in  teams, and  entails  problem-solving.    This  argu- ment was essentially replicated in the work of Joan Woodward (1965), who found that more  advanced  technologies  require  “or- ganic” rather than “mechanistic” forms of organization.  In effect, both authors sug- gested  that  work  would  be  transformed along the lines of a “post-industrial” model, giving rise to an improved quality of work- ing life (more recently, see Zuboff 1988). Although initial research attempting to 780 INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW establish the implications of work for alien- ation  found  only  weak  results  (Seeman 1967), subsequent research found job de- sign to have important implications for well- being, particularly self-esteem and mental functioning (Kohn and Schooler 1983:2), sense of control (Ross and Wright 1998), and alcohol consumption (see Martin and Roman 1996:6–7).  In a recent study using data coded from 86 ethnographies, Hodson (1996) also found that “participative” work organization was associated with lower alien- ation than its individualized counterpart, but  not  when  compared  to  its  traditional “craft” counterpart. Concern  about  work  alienation  was  to become  an  important  underpinning  for the “quality of working life” movement in the 1970s, which advocated widespread job redesign  and  enrichment  in  order  to  en- hance employee well-being (O’Toole et al. 1974).  AWPs may in turn be seen as partly an outgrowth of this movement.  Advocates have generally theorized that AWPs enhance an  employee’s  sense  of  belongingness, meaningfulness,  task  involvement,  and empowerment—the converse of Blauner’s dimensions.    In  this  respect,  debate  over their implications may in part be viewed as an  extension  of  debates  over  the  Wood- ward/Blauner  thesis.    Yet  there  has  been little  research  exploring  the  nature  and extent  of  these  linkages  or  their  implica- tions for the experience and consequences of work.3 The  strategy  of  the  present  study  is  to address these limitations using data from a random  telephone  survey  of  individuals, with multiple measures of AWPs and of the experience and outcomes of work.  Thus, I am able to address the implications of AWPs across  a  wide  array  of  jobs,  occupations, 3One exception is Tesluk and Vance (1996), who included measures of “work-life balance,” psychologi- cal well-being, and work meaningfulness in their analy- sis  of  the  mechanisms  through  which  participatory climates  and  team  orientations  affect  behavior  and outcomes.  Their study did not, however, address the implications of specific AWPs. and industries, and to do so in a way that allows for more comprehensive analysis of how AWPs specifically affect workers.  Be- low, I develop a model and set of hypoth- eses for analyzing these data. Model Development: Exploring the Implications of AWPs Variables For the present, it is useful to distinguish between the experience of work itself and the outcomes of this experience.  Two sets of variables are relevant to the former.  The first set, which may be referred to as “psycho- social”  variables,  includes  measures  indi- cating  whether  employees  are  able  to achieve  a  sense  of  belongingness,  of  task involvement, and of empowerment at work. These dimensions parallel Blauner’s dimen- sions of isolatedness, meaninglessness, es- trangement,  and  powerlessness,  respec- tively,  although  factor  analysis  indicated that  meaninglessness  and  estrangement represented  a  single  dimension  (see  Ap- pendix), and descriptive results indicated generally positive experiences on these di- mensions, thus requiring their relabeling (and recoding) for purposes of this study. The two experience variables in the sec- ond set, which may be referred to as “work intensification” variables, are workload and work  stressfulness.    High  values  of  the former  indicate  an  excessive  quantity  of work; high values of the latter, conflicting demands and problems that are beyond an individual’s  capacity  to  solve.    Both  are assumed by critics to be negatively affected by AWPs. Three  sets  of  outcomes  can  be  consid- ered relevant:  extra-work, attitudinal, and behavioral.    In  this  study,  each  is  repre- sented by two variables.  The “extra-work” variables  are  extra-work  fatigue  and  self- esteem.  Fatigue may vary with a number of factors, but all else equal, it should be higher if  the  employee  has  a  high  workload  or stressful work, as critics of AWPs have ar- gued to be the case.  Research by Kohn and Schooler (1983) has demonstrated that self- esteem is associated with the work experi- HIGH PERFORMANCE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF WORK? 781 ence, and it is consistent with the optimistic view of AWPs to expect that, by empower- ing workers and allowing them greater con- trol over their work, AWPs are conducive to the  development  of  higher  levels  of  self- esteem. The attitudinal variables are job satisfac- tion and commitment.  Although the litera- ture  for  these  two  variables  suggests  they have  somewhat  different  sets  of  anteced- ents  (for  example,  Ganster  and  Fusilier 1989),  AWPs  should  be  positively  associ- ated  with  each  if  they  have  the  positive implications assumed by proponents. The behavioral variables are motivation, or  the  extent  to  which  individuals  report effort in the performance of their job above that which is required, and organizational citizenship behavior, or the extent to which employees  engage  in  desirable  behavior not required by their job and not directly rewarded  (for  example,  Cappelli  and Rogovsky 1998).  Proponents generally as- sume that AWPs operate “voluntaristically,” through both of these variables, rather than “coercively,”  through  increased  workload and stress.  Thus, although these variables may be argued to represent employer out- comes  as  much  as  or  more  than  they  do worker outcomes per se (as does commit- ment), they are included because they shed light on this issue. AWPs  can  be  considered  at  two  levels. The first is the programmatic level, or the extent to which specific programs of AWPs are established.  I identify three such pro- grams:    (1)  a  quality  improvement  pro- gram, (2) a just-in-time (JIT) system, and (3) a re-engineering program.  These pro- grams  are  not  mutually  antithetical  and may be jointly implemented.  Nonetheless, they can represent distinctive programs and may  thus  be  expected  to  have  distinctive implications. A problem that arises with the identifica- tion of AWP programs is that they are typi- cally  assumed  to  operate  through  the  ef- fects of specific AWPs associated with them (for example, autonomous teams).  If so, any observed implications may be attribut- able to these AWPs rather than to the pro- grams themselves, and may vary if the AWPs associated with them vary.  It is necessary to separate  out  broad  programmatic  effects (for example, an emphasis on quality) from the effects of specific AWPs (for example, autonomous teams).  Thus specific AWPs represent  the  second  level  at  which  AWP programs can be studied. In  considering  specific  AWPs,  a  useful distinction  is  between  “on-line”  and  “off- line” AWPs (for example, Appelbaum and Batt  1994;  Levine  1995).    On-line  AWPs involve innovations having to do with the actual  design  of  work.    Five  appear  to  be most prominent in the literature:  (1) team- based  work  systems,  (2)  team  autonomy, (3) team responsibility for a good or ser- vice,  (4)  multi-skilling,  and  (5)  job  rota- tion.    Off-line  AWPs  involve  innovations having to do with employee participation.  I include four:  (1) informational meetings or briefings, such as town hall meetings or team briefings, (2) quality circles or “prob- lem-solving” groups, in which workers meet to  specifically  discuss  quality  or  workflow issues,  (3)  a  committee  system,  in  which permanently  established  committees  (for example,  gain-sharing  committees,  em- ployee assistance committees) meet to ad- dress specific issues, and (4) joint steering committees, which address broad policies and overall changes to the workplace. Finally,  alternative  economic  practices have been closely associated with AWPs.  I include two economic AWPs:  group bonus plans, and profit- or gain-sharing. Hypotheses The primary concern of this paper is to establish the implications of AWPs for the experience  and  outcomes  of  work  in  gen- eral.    To  attempt  to  establish  or  explore individual hypotheses as to the specific as- sociations  between  each  AWP  and  each dependent variable may be of some theo- retical value, but it is beyond the scope of this paper and has limited bearing on the general research issue at hand.  Rather, I am concerned to explore overall patterns across  the  dependent  variables.    Accord- ingly, I develop only general hypotheses to guide the analysis, beginning with the ex- pected effects of the overall level of AWP 782 INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW adoption, then of alternative forms of work organization, then of individual AWPs and AWP programs.  Because of limitations of existing  research,  I  develop  these  largely on an a priori basis, based on assumptions and arguments appearing in the literature on  AWPs.    Ideally,  however,  the  present paper  will  serve  as  an  impetus  for  more nuanced, fine-grained analysis along these lines in the future. Effects  of  level  of  AWP  adoption.    Propo- nents of the high-performance model gen- erally  proceed  from  the  assumption  that the effects of AWPs increase with the extent to which they are adopted.  These effects are  believed  to  operate  largely  through psycho-social variables, either because they enrich the work itself or because they allow employees greater influence over their work environment  (see  Cappelli  and  Rogovsky 1998:636–37).  Though a number of stud- ies  have  assumed  linear  effects,  the  argu- ment  has  increasingly  been  that  AWPs complement each other, so that each AWP is likely to have a larger effect to the extent that it is implemented in combination with others (Ichniowski et al. 1996:325; Becker and  Huselid  1998;  Wood  1999:368,  391). Within the literature on high-performance practices, there is therefore an expectation of steadily increasing marginal returns, so that  the  return  for  each  additional  AWP adopted is greater than that for its prede- cessor.    If  AWPs  operate  largely  through their  implications  for  workers,  we  might thus expect similar results, with their com- bined effects having an exponential rather than a monotonic association with the ex- perience and outcomes of work.  Thus: Hypothesis  1a.    To  the  extent  that  they  are adopted, AWPs can be expected to have positive effects for employees, largely due to their impli- cations  for  psycho-social  variables  (belong- ingness, task involvement, empowerment). Hypothesis  1b.    The  positive  effects  of  AWPs can be expected to increase exponentially to the extent that they are adopted in combina- tion. Although the arguments of critical schol- ars have often appeared to contradict those of proponents, these scholars have typically focused  on  the  implications  of  AWPs  for work  intensification  rather  than  psycho- social  variables.    It  is  possible  that  AWPs have contradictory effects, intensifying the work  process  while  at  the  same  time  en- hancing personal satisfaction and commit- ment.    Thus,  even  if  AWPs  have  positive psycho-social effects, they may still be asso- ciated with work intensification. Hypothesis  1c.    To  the  extent  that  they  are adopted,  AWPs  can  also  be  expected  to  have negative  effects  for  employees,  through  their implications for work intensification (workload and stressfulness). Effects of alternative forms of work organiza- tion.  As discussed earlier, many believe that “lean”  work  organization  has  negative  ef- fects,  mainly  through  its  implications  for work  intensification,  while  “team”  work organization  has  largely  positive  ones, mainly through its implications for psycho- social  variables.    The  essential  difference between  “lean”  and  “team”  organization would  appear  to  be  that,  although  both entail organization by groups, the former is implemented  in  the  context  of  a  just-in- time  system  and  entails  little  team  au- tonomy, while the latter is not implemented in the context of a just-in-time system and entails  considerable  autonomy  (for  ex- ample,  Rinehart  et  al.  1997:85ff.).    Thus, under lean work organization, employees are  driven  to  work  harder.    In  contrast, team work organization has the more “vol- untaristic effects” assumed by proponents, so that work is more meaningful, fulfilling, and empowering. Hypothesis 2a.  Lean work organization has largely negative effects for employees, due primarily to its implications for work intensity. Hypothesis  2b.    Team  work  organization  has largely positive effects for employees, due pri- marily to its implications for psycho-social vari- ables. Authors have often failed to specifically identify the form of organization to which they are comparing lean and team organi- zation.    It  would,  however,  seem  that  the main referent is the individualized organi- zation assumed to predominate in postwar workplaces, not more traditional group or HIGH PERFORMANCE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF WORK? 783 team forms of organization, under which there  is  no  JIT  system  and  no  team  au- tonomy  (that  is,  traditional  supervision). Though the latter cannot be associated with the high-performance or transformed work- place model, it can be considered an im- portant  alternative  to  work  individualiza- tion.  It can be expected to have positive effects  due  to  its  implications  for belongingness  and  possibly  task  involve- ment and empowerment (as there is greater social interaction and opportunity to exert influence through one’s supervisor). Hypothesis  2c.    Traditional  group  work  should have positive effects for employees, largely due to its implications for psycho-social variables. Two other forms of organization might also be identified:  individualized JIT, un- der  which  there  is  a  JIT  system  yet  little group work, and what Berggren (1992:254– 56)  has  dubbed  “post-lean”  organization, which is a hybrid of lean and team organi- zation combining elements of JIT with au- tonomous  teams.    Though  these  alterna- tives have received little notice in the litera- ture, they comprise further alternatives to the individualized work organization asso- ciated with the postwar era and hence war- rant  inclusion.    Generally,  individualized JIT should have even more negative impli- cations for workers than does lean organi- zation, while “post-lean” organization may combine the effects of both lean and team organization, with mixed effects for work- ers. Hypothesis 2d.  Individualized lean work organi- zation should have negative effects for employ- ees, due to its implications for intensification variables. Hypothesis  2e.    Post–lean  work  organization should have positive effects for employees due to  its  implications  for  psycho-social  variables, and negative effects due to its implications for intensification variables. Effects of individual AWPs.  Much of the confusion over forms of work organization appears to extend to the analysis of AWPs in general.    It  may  be  possible  to  identify distinctive systems of AWPs in theory, but in practice AWPs tend to be adopted in a piecemeal fashion, with the specific combi- nation of AWPs adopted varying consider- ably  from  one  workplace  to  the  next (Appelbaum and Batt 1994).  There is hence a need to attempt to “unbundle” the impli- cations of AWPs. AWP programs can be expected to affect work  experience  and  outcomes  through their implications for specific AWPs associ- ated with them.  However, these programs may contain a broader philosophy or set of objectives not captured by individual AWPs, with important implications for the broader workplace  culture.    If  so,  any  effects  of these  programs  should  be  observed  even after specific AWPs have been entered into the  analysis.    In  particular,  criticisms  of lean  work  organization  appear  to  center around the just-in-time system and its ap- parent implications for the intensification of the labor process.  Accordingly, just-in- time should bear negative implications for employees,  primarily  through  increased workload, stressfulness, and fatigue.  Simi- lar associations may be expected for work- place re-engineering after controlling for specific AWPs that may be associated with it (for example, autonomous teams), because it  typically  entails  “doing  more  with  less” (Hammer 1990).  In contrast, quality man- agement programs appear to require high levels  of  employee  commitment  (Hyman and Mason 1995:44).  We could thus expect them to be implemented in ways that are largely beneficial to employees, or at least in such a way that employees are inculcated with  values  and  beliefs  conducive  to  em- ployer  goals  and  hence  to  more  positive evaluations of their work experience. Hypothesis 3a.  Just-in-time systems and re-engi- neering programs should have largely negative effects  for  employees,  primarily  due  to  their implications for work intensification, while qual- ity management programs should have largely positive effects, primarily due to their implica- tions for psycho-social variables. Of  the  on-line  AWPs,  team-based  work can be expected to have positive implica- tions  for  employees,  primarily  because  it allows for increased group interaction and hence belongingness.  Consistent with ex- isting research findings (Cotton 1993:188– 784 INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW 90), team autonomy should also have posi- tive implications, as should team responsi- bility.    Both  can  be  expected  to  increase empowerment  and  possibly  task  involve- ment.    However,  both  may  also  result  in increased  workload  and  stressfulness,  as employees feel increased pressure to per- form  (Barker  1992;  Graham  1995).    Job rotation can be expected to have positive implications, largely because it can be ex- pected to reduce monotony and boredom and hence enhance task involvement.  Multi- skilling can also be expected to have posi- tive implications for employees, as it should enhance complexity and hence task involve- ment.  Yet it may also have negative implica- tions, as it is often a device for enhancing “functional” flexibility, which in turn can mean  work  intensification  and  hence  an increased workload. Hypothesis 3b.  Team-based work and job rota- tion  may  have  positive  effects  for  employees, due to their implications for psycho-social vari- ables, while team autonomy, team responsibil- ity, and multi-skilling should have both positive and negative effects for employees, due to their implications  for  psycho-social  and  intensifica- tion variables, respectively. Recent  reviews  of  the  research  on  par- ticipative  decision-making  (for  example, Locke et al. 1997) suggest that the effects of off-line AWPs may be more limited than pro- ponents  have  assumed.    This  may  be  espe- cially true for nonunion representative par- ticipation  systems  (Cotton  1993:129).    Yet research addressing the implications of di- rect participation mechanisms such as qual- ity circles has also failed to yield “optimis- tic” conclusions (Cotton 1993:86).  None- theless, these findings could reflect some of the methodological problems identified earlier.  There are good reasons to expect off-line AWPs to have positive implications for the experience and outcomes of work. Information  meetings  and  quality  circles can be expected to enhance belongingness, empowerment,  and  possibly  task  involve- ment,  especially  to  the  extent  that  indi- vidual workers are involved with them.  In addition, committee systems and steering committees,  because  they  entail  worker representation,  can  be  expected  to  have positive  associations  with  empowerment. More generally, off-line AWPs can also be expected to enhance the legitimacy of em- ployer decisions, with positive overall im- plications for attitudes and behavior. Hypothesis 3c.  Off-line AWPs can be expected to have positive effects for employees, due in part to  their  direct  implications  for  psycho-social variables, but also, indirectly, because they en- hance legitimacy. Economic  AWPs  appear  to  have  had  un- certain  effects  (Hyman  and  Mason 1995:107; Freeman 2000:20).  Nonetheless, proponents have argued that they can be expected to enhance employee identifica- tion with group or workplace performance, and to establish norms conducive to perfor- mance.  If so, economic AWPs may have a “disciplinary  effect,”  associated  with  the intensification of work, with negative impli- cations  for  outcomes  associated  with  the work  experience  (Hyman  and  Mason 1995:99). Hypothesis 3d.  Economic AWPs should be posi- tively associated with work intensification and negatively associated with extra-work, attitudi- nal, and behavioral outcomes. Methods To address the implications of AWPs, I draw  on  data  from  a  telephone  survey  of 508  employed  Canadians  conducted  in 1997.    An  added  digit  version  of  random digit dialing (see Lavrakas 1993) was em- ployed.    Phone  numbers  were  generated from the Canada telephone directory (avail- able on CD Rom), and then the final two digits  of  each  number  were  randomly  al- tered, thereby ensuring accurate represen- tation  of  unlisted  and  newly  listed  num- bers.  Proportional sampling was used for all  provinces  except  Quebec,  which  was excluded  due  to  language  differences.4 4The sample characteristics, compared to the char- acteristics of the Canadian labor force as a whole (see Akyeampong  1997,  1998),  as  reported  in  brackets, are the following:  53% female (vs. 47%), 30% repre- sented  by  a  union  (vs.  31%),  40%  in  managerial/ professional  occupations  (vs.  34%),  40%  in  other HIGH PERFORMANCE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF WORK? 785 After ineligible respondents were excluded, the estimated response rate was 55%.5 reliability  inter-item  The  variables  and,  where  appropriate, their  scores (Cronbach’s alpha) appear in Tables 1 and 2.  The AWP measures (Table 1) are cre- ated  from  single  items,  as  has  been  the convention in the literature on AWPs.  The work  experience  and  outcome  measures consist of multiple Likert-type items (Table 2).  All have Cronbach’s alphas that equal or exceed the .65 level (all but Stressfulness have alphas above .70), which is generally considered  acceptable  for  an  analysis  of this  nature  (for  example,  Nunnally 1965:226).    Factor  analysis  also  indicated that  these  variables  represent  distinct  di- mensions  (that  is,  dimensional  validity). But the lack of firm precedent in the litera- ture  for  a  number  of  these  variables  may give rise to validity concerns.  Thus, further information relevant to their validity is in the Appendix. Work experience.  Belongingness, Task In- volvement, and Empowerment are, respec- tively, four-, nine-, and six-item scales.  The items  for  these  scales  were  originally  de- rived  from  the  literature  on  work  alien- ation, especially the work of Melvin Seeman (1959, 1967), Robert Blauner (1964), and white-collar, sales, or service occupations (vs. 37%), and 20% in blue-collar occupations (vs. 28%).  Re- spondents on average reported that they worked 39 hours per week (vs. 38 hours), and were paid $16.22 per  hour  (vs.  15.76).    Ninety-one  percent  reported permanent  employment  positions  (vs.  88%),  while 15% reported working less than 30 hours a week (vs. 17%), which is commonly defined as “part-time.”  The sample characteristics thus appear to be reasonably representative of the Canadian labor force as a whole. The  only  major  differences  seem  to  be  the  under- representation of males and blue-collar workers.  Both may  reflect  low  sample  representation  of  construc- tion and transport equipment-handling workers, who represented only 2% of the sample, compared to 8% of the Canadian labor force. 5Two hundred and seven contacts hung up before their eligibility could be determined.  Of those who did not hang up, 45% were eligible.  Imputing the same eligibility percentage to hang-ups results in the calculated response rate of 55%.  An assumption that all hang-ups were eligible would produce a response rate of 48%, which represents a lower bound. Karl Marx (1959 [1844]:66–68).  However, a number of specific items are drawn from Tesluk  and  Vance  (1996)  and  from  the National Organizations Survey (NOS; see Kalleberg et al. 1996).  Workload consists of three items drawn from the NOS and from Tesluk and Vance (1996), while Stressfulness consists of five items, two of which are drawn from Tesluk and Vance (1996). Outcomes.    Self-Esteem  consists  of  four items drawn from Rosenberg’s self-esteem scale  (see  Rosenberg,  Schooler,  and Schoenbach 1989).  Fatigue is a three-item scale developed specifically for this study. Job Satisfaction is a four-item scale created from the Michigan Organizational Assess- ment Package (Institute for Social Research 1975).    Commitment  consists  of  a  three- item scale drawn from Mowday’s Organiza- tional  Commitment  Questionnaire (Mowday et al. 1982), but adapted so that it addresses commitment to “the person who manages or is in charge of” the respondent’s workplace.    In  making  this  adaptation,  I sought to avoid possible confusion between commitment to the management of a spe- cific workplace, which appears to be cen- tral to AWPs, and commitment to a possibly distant corporate entity.  Motivation con- sists of a five-item scale, two items of which are  drawn  from  Brockner  et  al.  (1992). Citizenship Behavior consists of seven items based on three dimensions of citizenship identified  by  Podsakoff  and  McKenzie (1990):  altruism, courtesy, and civic virtue. Although the convention in the literature has  been  to  rely  on  supervisory  reports6 (for example, Niehoff and Moorman 1993; Van Dyne et al. 1994; Cappelli and Rogovsky 1998),  the  method  of  the  present  study required the use of self-reports.  In addi- tion, factor analysis suggested two dimen- sions, one for courtesy, and one combining altruism and virtue (see Appendix).  How- ever,  only  the  former  had  an  acceptable reliability score, and neither performed as 6In addition, I operationalized Citizenship more narrowly than other researchers have.  The broader operationalization  employed  in  other  studies  over- laps with many of the other variables in this study. 786 INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW Table 1.

For the off-line reforms, respondents were asked if the workplace had each, and if so, how many times per day, week, month, or year they were involved with a meeting of each; answers were converted to a yearly frequency score.  For the remainder of the items, respondents were asked to “indicate to the best of your knowledge whether your workplace has each,” and, if so, “the extent to which it involves you”:  not at all (=1), very little (=2), to some extent (=3), considerable extent (=4), to a great extent (=5). aFor the off-line reforms, respondents are for present purposes considered to have “meaningful involvement” if the frequency of their involvement is one or more times per month.  For the remainder, the term “meaningful involvement” refers to either “considerable extent” or “a great extent.” bFor  the  off-line  reforms,  the  means  are  calculated  as  the  average  number  of  times  per  year  that  the respondent was involved in each.

The response options were not at all, very little, to some extent, to a considerable extent, and to a great extent. On-Line AWPs.  Similarly,  Job Rotation, Multi-Skilling,  Team-Based  Work,  Team Autonomy, and Team Responsibility were measured  by  asking  respondents  if  there was, respectively, “a job rotation program,” “a cross-training or multi-skilling program,” “a team-based work system,” “self-directed or  semi-autonomous  (no  direct  supervi- sion)” teams, and teams given “responsibil- ity for specific products or services.”  Again, in  each  case  respondents  were  asked whether the practice existed in their work- place  and,  if  so,  the  extent  to  which  it involved them. Off-Line AWPs.  Informational Meetings, QCs,  Committee  System,  and  Joint  Steer- ing Committee were measured by asking if there  were,  respectively,  “informational meetings or briefings for workers (for ex- ample,  town  hall  meetings  or  team  brief- ings),” “team or area meetings held specifi- cally  for  workers  to  discuss  quality  or workflow issues (sometimes referred to as quality circles),” “a committee system, where permanently established committees meet to address specific issues—other than health and safety (for example, social, employee assistance, gain-sharing),” and “joint steer- ing committee meetings, with management and worker reps, to address overall changes and broad policies for your workplace as a whole.”    Respondents  who  affirmed  the presence of an off-line AWP were asked to indicate how often they were involved in it. These  responses  were  then  converted  to yearly frequency scores. Economic AWPs.  Profit-Sharing and Group Bonus were measured in the same way as on-line AWPs, based on items asking if there was  “a  profit  or  gain  sharing  system  (for example,  for  productivity  gains)”  and  “a group or departmental bonus system,” re- spectively. Controls.  The implementation of various AWPs, and the extent to which they affect individual workers, can be expected to vary with a number of factors—factors that may also have consequences for the experience and outcomes of work.  Most notable in this respect is whether there has been growth or decline  in  the  size  of  an  establishment, because this can have implications for the type of AWPs adopted and for the way work- ers  experience  their  work  (Cooke  1989). Establishment size may also be important, because it has been shown to be a strong predictor  of  the  adoption  of  AWPs (Osterman 1994; Gittleman et al. 1998), yet also has implications for work experience and  outcome  variables  (Cully  et  al. 1999:181–89).  A number of additional fac- tors  may  also  come  into  play,  including whether the worker is temporary or perma- nent, the number of hours worked, whether there  is  a  union,  respondent  hourly  pay, and gender.  All may be expected to have some association with both the adoption of AWPs  and  the  experience  and  perceived outcomes  of  work.    These  more  “contex- tual” variables are thus included as controls (see notes to Tables 3, 5, and 6). A further control variable is the nature of the work itself.  Much of the theory of AWPs  suggests  that  they  operate  in  part through their implications for an enriched job  design.    Yet  contingency  theories  of AWP implementation (for example, Godard 1998) and of organization in general (in- cluding  the  work  of  Woodward)  suggest that AWPs may be more likely to be adopted where the work is already complex or en- riched.    If  so,  controlling  for  complexity could  result  in  downward  estimation  bi- ases,  yet  failing  to  do  so  could  result  in upward biases.  I cannot fully address this issue in this paper, but I do run regressions with and without a complexity measure to explore  the  extent  to  which  complexity matters.  In so doing, I also shed light on the extent to which AWPs have effects apart from  those  on  job  enrichment,  thus  ad- dressing debates over how AWPs work (see Cappelli and Rogovsky 1998:636–37).  This measure consists of five items drawn from the Oldham and Hackman (1975) Job Di- agnostic Index.7 7The items are “your job requires a high level of skill,” “your job is challenging,” “your job makes you HIGH PERFORMANCE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF WORK? 789 Although these control variables help to rule out a number of possible alternative explanations  for  the  results  reported  be- low, they may not exhaust all possible ex- planations.  As I discuss further below, this may limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis in this paper. Results Effects  of  level  of  AWP  adoption.    In  the literature assessing the effects of high-per- formance  practices,  authors  typically  cre- ate an additive scale of the extent to which these  practices  have  been  adopted  (for  a discussion,  see  Godard  and  Delaney 2000:489).  To address the overall implica- tions  of  AWPs  (hypotheses  1a–1c),  I  fol- lowed this convention, first converting the off-line  items  to  five-point  scales  so  as  to ensure  roughly  equal  weighting  of  these items with the programmatic, on-line, and economic AWP items.8  The resulting scale included  all  AWPs  identified  in  Table  1, with the exception of JIT, which detracted from  the  reliability  (Cronbach’s  alpha) score.9  The alpha for this scale is .76.  To aid  in  the  interpretation  of  the  results,  I divided this scale by the number of items comprising it.  As a result, the maximum possible range of the scale is from 1.00 to 5.00.    The  actual  range  was  1.00  to  4.31, with a mean of 1.85. To explore for positive exponential ef- fects (hypothesis 1a), I also converted this index to its quadratic form.  If an exponen- tial relationship obtains, as the arguments of proponents suggest should be the case, the coefficients for both the first- and sec- ond-order  terms  should  be  positive  (see Aiken  and  West  1991:66;  Jaccard  et  al. 1990:51). keep learning new things,” “there is a lot of variety in the kinds of things you do in your job,” and “your job requires lots of mental effort.”  Cronbach’s alpha is .88. 8The weighting was as follows:  1 = if two or fewer meetings/sessions per year; 2 = if 2 to 6; 3 = if 7 to 12; 4 = if 13 to 24; 5 = if more than 24. 9Regressions  in  which  JIT  was  included  yielded virtually identical results. As indicated in column 1 of Table 3, the linear form of AWP Involvement has posi- tive and statistically significant associations with all of the dependent variables except Workload and Fatigue.  These results thus suggest that AWPs are associated with more stressful work (hypothesis 1c) but that they also have positive implications for how work is  experienced  and  the  outcomes  associ- ated with it (hypothesis 1a). A  different  picture  emerges  when  the quadratic form is introduced (column 2). Both the first order and the squared terms are  statistically  significant  in  the  regres- sions for Belongingness, Task Involvement, Empowerment,  Job  Satisfaction,  Self-Es- teem, and Citizenship Behavior.  But con- trary  to  expectations,  the  signs  for  the squared  term  are  consistently  negative.10 This suggests that, instead of increasing in magnitude,  the  marginal  returns  to  AWP adoption begin to decline and may even be negative after a certain level of adoption is reached.    To  try  to  identify  this  level,  I estimated the bend point, or point at which the maximum returns to AWPs are achieved, for  each  dependent  variable  (Aiken  and West 1991:76).  The estimates of this point ranged from a score of 2.3 for Self-Esteem to  3.1  for  Citizenship  Behavior,  with  an average score of 2.7 across all the depen- dent variables for which the quadratic form is statistically significant (these calculations 10I also ran regressions with each individual AWP included, and then performed an F test to see if the addition of a dummy variable indicating whether the respondent was in the highest quartile on the involve- ment index made a difference.  In no case was the F test significant.  I also tested for interactions between team reforms and both off-line and economic AWPs. I created a single variable combining Teams, Team Autonomy,  Team  Responsibility,  and  Multi-Skilling (alpha = .75).  I then ran a series of regressions with the quadratic of this new team variable and an inter- action term between it and either a single economic or off-line AWP, repeating this process until all of the economic  and  off-line  AWPs  had  been  tried.    The interaction terms were rarely statistically significant, and  where  they  were,  the  sign,  often  as  not,  was opposite that expected, suggesting substitution rather than complementary effects.  I also explored whether using  the  linear  form  of  the  team  variable  yielded better results.  It did not. See Godard (2001a). 790 INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW Table 3.

Because  the maximum range on the AWP index is from 1 to 5, and this index represents the aver- age score for each of the 13 items compris- ing it, these values suggest that the returns to  AWPs  are  maximized  at  relatively  low levels of adoption. I  also  plotted  the  predicted  values  of each dependent variable at different levels of  AWP  Involvement  to  explore  whether higher levels of adoption actually have nega- tive  effects.11    Such  effects  were  observed for some dependent variables.  For example, 11To  do  so,  I  relied  on  the  nonstandard  coeffi- cients (available on request).  While this enabled me to plot various raw values of AWP Involvement, the dependent variables were computed from standard- ized  items  and  hence  represent  standard  scores.    I also computed the changes over the range from 3.0 to 4.0  because  only  a  limited  number  of  cases  scored above 4.0.  To extrapolate beyond this would thus be unwarranted. as  the  AWP  Involvement  index  increases from  a  value  of  3.0  to  4.0,  the  predicted score on Self-Esteem declines from .76 to .38, and on Job Satisfaction it declines from 1.4  to  1.08  (standardized  scores).    How- ever,  on  the  remaining  variables  the  de- cline  over  this  range  is  smaller,  varying from .20 for Empowerment to a low of .07 for Citizenship.  Alternative specifications, with  the  AWP  Involvement  index  divided into  four  dummy  variables  representing each  quartile  of  the  distribution,  yielded similar results (available on request). Also  notable  are  the  associations  for Workload,  Stressfulness,  Fatigue,  Motiva- tion,  and  Commitment.    The  coefficients for  Stressfulness  are  statistically  insignifi- cant but positive, consistent with the linear association  observed  in  the  column  1  re- gressions.  For Workload and Fatigue, both coefficients  are  also  statistically  insignifi- cant, but their signs suggest that AWPs are associated with decreases in workload and HIGH PERFORMANCE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF WORK? 791 fatigue at low to moderate levels only, fol- lowed by possible increases at higher levels of adoption.  For Motivation and Commit- ment,  the  results  suggest  positive  but  di- minishing and even negative effects at high levels  of  adoption;  but  the  second  order terms  are  (again)  not  statistically  signifi- cant,  suggesting  that  if  the  latter  effects occur, they are relatively weak. The  magnitudes  of  the  coefficients  for AWP  Involvement  and  its  quadratic  form drop  somewhat  when  Complexity  is  con- trolled for (column 3).  However, the de- clines are relatively small, and significance levels generally remain unchanged.  This suggests that AWPs have aggregate effects beyond any implications they may have for Complexity,  and  that  these  effects  are largely not attributable to any tendency for them  to  be  adopted  where  Complexity  is already high.12  It would thus appear that the level of AWP involvement, both before and after I control for job complexity, gen- erally has a number of positive implications for employees up to a point, though it also results in more stressful work.  Beyond that point, any positive effects of further adop- tion tend to decline in magnitude and in some cases may even become negative, while work becomes even more stressful. It  is  possible  that  these  results  suffer from common method bias.  Yet common method bias usually implies artificially in- flated linear associations.  While it may ac- count for the associations observed for low to moderate values of AWP Involvement, it provides little obvious explanation for the nonlinear associations observed across all values.    In  addition,  measurement  of  job characteristics represents one of the major concerns in the method bias literature (for example, Glick et al. 1986), and so if com- 12When the sample is reduced to exclude manage- rial and professional workers (N = 310), the magni- tudes of the coefficients increase somewhat, with the squared  form  of  AWP  Involvement  also  becoming statistically significant (and, again, negative) in the Commitment regression, and the linear form becom- ing statistically significant in the Fatigue regression. But there are no substantive changes. mon  method  bias  were  a  problem,  one might expect controlling for Complexity to partial  out  variation  attributable  to  this bias, substantially weakening the observed associations.  Yet this did not happen.  Fi- nally, I created an alternative AWP Involve- ment index in which all items were dichoto- mized based on the presence or absence of “meaningful  involvement”  (see  Table  1, note a), thus reducing possible perceptual biases.  This index yielded identical results, except  that  the  magnitudes  of  the  coeffi- cients (and, in a few cases, levels of signifi- cance) were slightly smaller. Effects of alternative forms of work organiza- tion.  To address the implications of alter- native forms of work organization (hypoth- eses 2a–2e), I first created dummy variables intended to represent each form identified earlier,  based  on  whether  individuals  re- ported that they were involved to a consid- erable or great extent with (1) a JIT pro- gram, (2) a team-based work system, and (if the latter) (3) autonomous teamwork.  The specific breakdowns appear in Table 4.  Most are  self-explanatory,  though  I  label  non- autonomous  teams  with  no  JIT  as  Tradi- tional Group (rather than team) organiza- tion to avoid confusion between this form and Team Organization.  Subsequent analy- sis also indicated that there is in any case probably little reason to consider non-au- tonomous teams different from traditional groups in anything but name.13 Table 5 reports regressions of the depen- dent variables on these measures, first con- trolling for the context variables only (col. 1),  then  for  Complexity  as  well  (col.  2), then for all additional AWPs as well (col. 3).14    Traditional  Individualized  Work  is 13To check this, I recomputed Traditional Group using  a  different  item,  asking  simply  if  the  respon- dent worked “as part of a team or group.”  The results were essentially the same. 14There may be a tendency to confuse the specific organization of work with additional AWPs that may or may not be implemented in conjunction with this form.  Thus, for example, any negative effects of lean organization  may  be  offset  by  other  AWPs  imple- mented  in  conjunction  with  this  form  of  organiza- tion,  conflating  its  effects.    Controlling  for  these other AWPs helps to address this possibility. 792 INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW Table 4.

Also see Table 1. the default or referent category.  As indi- cated  in  column  1,  both  Team  and  Post- Lean have moderately positive associations with  Belongingness,  Empowerment,  and Citizenship  Behavior  before  controls  are added  for  Complexity  or  the  remaining AWPs.    Team  is  also  positively  associated with Motivation, while Lean has a statisti- cally  significant  positive  association  with Citizenship Behavior, but no other signifi- cant associations.  The most powerful asso- ciations,  however,  are  for  Traditional Group,  which  is  positively  related  to Belongingness, Task Involvement, Empow- erment, Job Satisfaction, Self-Esteem, Mo- tivation,  Commitment,  and  Citizenship Behavior, and negatively related to Fatigue, in all cases at statistically significant levels. The  magnitudes  of  these  associations  are all substantially greater than for any of the other forms of organization.  Finally, Indi- vidualized  Lean  has  a  statistically  signifi- cant negative association with Fatigue (pos- sibly reflecting a type I error), but no other significant associations. These  results  again  change  little  when Complexity  is  controlled  for  (column  2), indicating that the observed effects are not attributable  to  task  characteristics.    How- ever,  they  could  be  attributable  to  other AWPs that are not used to create the mea- sures  of  work  organization  forms  but  are correlated with these forms.  As indicated in  column  3,  the  results  for  Traditional Group, however, remain largely unchanged when these other AWPs (as well as context variables) are controlled for.  There is also no change for Lean.  But Team becomes statistically insignificant in all but the Citi- zenship Behavior regression, and Post-Lean in all but the regressions for Empowerment and  Citizenship  Behavior.    Individual- ized Lean becomes statistically insignifi- cant  in  all  regressions.    These  changes could reflect collinearity problems.  But they do suggest that the apparent effects for all but Traditional Group are largely illusory,  reflecting  the  effects  of  other work practices with which they tend to be associated. These results should be interpreted with caution, because the operationalization of the different forms of work organization is rudimentary.    But  they  strongly  suggest that traditional group organization is pref- erable not only to the individualized orga- nization  associated  with  postwar  work  ar- rangements, but also to team and lean forms of  organization  associated  with  the  high- performance model. Effects of individual AWPs.  Columns 2 and 3 of Table 6 report regressions with individual AWPs and AWP programs, be- fore and after controlling for Complex- ity (as well as context variables).  Column 1 reports zero-order correlations, so that it is possible to explore whether a priori implications  of  AWPs  observed  in  field research  are  spurious,  reflecting  work- place conditions or other programs and practices  not  controlled  for  in  this  re- search. HIGH PERFORMANCE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF WORK? 793 Table 5.

Of the programmatic variables, JIT ap- pears  to  have  limited  albeit  negative  ef- fects, with negative coefficients in the ini- tial  Belongingness,  Job  Satisfaction,  and Commitment regressions (col. 2).  This is largely  consistent  with  expectations  (hy- pothesis 3a), although no associations are observed with the intensification measures. Notably, these findings are stronger than is suggested  by  the  zero-order  correlations (col.  1),  possibly  because  JIT  tends  to  be implemented along with other AWPs that offset its negative effects.15 15For example, perusal of the AWP inter-correla- tions suggested that this is because JITs are positively Also  consistent  with  expectations  (hy- pothesis  3a),  Re-engineering  appears  to affect  only  the  work  intensification  vari- ables,  having  positive  correlations  with Workload  and  Stressfulness  and  positive, statistically  significant  coefficients  in  the initial  (col.  2)  regressions  for  Workload and Fatigue.  It would thus appear that re- engineering programs have negative impli- correlated with Group Bonus, which is also positively correlated with Belongingness, Job Satisfaction, and Commitment  (though  it  becomes  statistically  insig- nificant  in  the  Belongingness  and  Job  Satisfaction regressions). 794 INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW Table 6.

This suggests that any observed ef- fects of quality management programs are attributable to the specific practices associ- ated with them rather than to broader “pro- grammatic” effects per se. Among the “on-line” AWPs, Job Rotation appears to have virtually no effects, with a statistically  significant  association  in  only the initial Citizenship Behavior regression. This  association  is  also  negative,  which  is contrary to expectations.  It is also possible that rotation prevents employees from de- veloping  commitment  toward  their  col- leagues or the in-depth knowledge neces- sary to provide them with assistance when needed.  This may be especially true where rotation is between rather than within work areas. Multi-Skilling is positively correlated with Belongingness,  Empowerment,  Job  Satis- faction, and Commitment, and negatively correlated with Fatigue.  However, with the exception of the association for Fatigue, all of these associations are statistically insig- nificant in the initial (col. 2) regressions. Even  the  association  for  Fatigue  is  weak, and  the  negative  sign  may  indicate  that multi-skilling  is  more  likely  to  occur  in workplaces  where  there  is  a  variable workload  with  substantial  slack  times,  in which  case  the  causal  association  may  be reversed. More noteworthy are the results for the three team-related variables.  In particular, Team-Based Work has strong and statisti- cally significant positive correlations with Belongingness, Task Involvement, Empow- erment, Job Satisfaction, Self-Esteem, Com- mitment, and Citizenship Behavior.  These results change very little in the column 2 regressions, though Team-Based Work also becomes  statistically  significant  in  the Stressfulness and Fatigue regressions, where it  has  negative  associations.    Thus,  team- based work appears to have highly positive implications  for  workers.    Yet  Team  Au- tonomy  is  significantly  correlated  with only  Job  Satisfaction,  and  has  statistically significant negative coefficients in the col- umn 2 regressions for Belongingness, Task Involvement, Job Satisfaction, Motivation, Commitment,  and  Citizenship  Behavior. 796 INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW In addition, though Team Responsibility is  significantly  correlated  with  Belong- ingness,  Task  Involvement,  Empower- ment, Work-load, Stressfulness, Job Sat- isfaction, and Self-Esteem (all positive), its  coefficient  is  statistically  significant (and  positive)  only  for  Workload, Stressfulness,  and  Fatigue  in  the  initial (col. 2) regressions. The  results  for  Team  Autonomy  and Responsibility,  both  of  which  may  be viewed  as  differentiating  more  “tradi- tional” group work from transformed or “high-performance” teams, are contrary to  expectations.    They  indicate  that  al- though  team-based  work  has  important positive effects, these effects may be de- creased somewhat by the introduction of team autonomy and of responsibility for a specific product or service.  When both of  these  variables  are  controlled  for, therefore, the apparent (positive) effects of team work are strengthened, no longer offset by the negative effects of team au- tonomy and responsibility.  In turn, when team work is controlled for, the negative implications  of  team  autonomy  and  re- sponsibility for employees become more apparent.  This is most striking with re- spect  to  Team  Responsibility,  which  at the correlational level appears to have a number of positive implications for em- ployees, but is associated primarily with work  intensification  and  fatigue  once other AWPs are controlled for. With  the  exception  of  the  Workload, Stressfulness, and Fatigue regressions, the coefficients  for  Team  Autonomy  and Team Responsibility are also substantially smaller  than  are  those  for  Team-Based Work,  indicating  that  the  negative  ef- fects  of  the  former  may  not  offset  the positive effects of the latter.  Thus, work- ers  in  high-performance  teams  (that  is, teams with autonomy and responsibility) may find themselves worse off than their counterparts in more traditional groups or  teams  (that  is,  without  autonomy  or responsibility).    But  they  may  be  better off  in  some  respects  (for  example, belongingness,  task  involvement)  than those in traditional individualized jobs. A similar story emerges with respect to “off-line”  AWPs.16    Information  Sharing is  positively  correlated  with  Belong- ingness,  Task  Involvement,  Empower- ment, Job Satisfaction, Self-Esteem, Com- mitment, and Citizenship Behavior, and negatively correlated with Fatigue.  These results change little in the initial (col. 2) regressions,  with  the  exception  of  the Empowerment regression, where the co- efficient is statistically insignificant.  In contrast, Quality Circle, Committee Sys- tem, and Steering Committee, despite a number of significant correlations, have few  statistically  significant  associations in the initial (col. 2) regressions.  Quality Circle  is  statistically  significant  only  in the  Empowerment  regression,  Commit- tee  System  only  in  the  Workload  and Stressfulness  regressions,  and  Steering Committee  in  none  of  the  regressions. The finding for Quality Circles is as ex- pected,  indicating  that  they  do  enable workers to make (or at least perceive they make) a difference in their work environ- ment.  The results for Committee System are difficult to explain, though it is pos- sible that there is reverse causation, with these systems implemented in workplaces where there is more intensive and stress- ful  work,  in  order  to  address  problems and concerns of workers.  It appears that steering committees simply do not mat- ter.  The weakness of these latter findings is generally consistent with prior research on participative decision-making, as dis- cussed earlier.  However, the finding for Quality  Circles  points  to  the  value  of using more fine-grained dependent vari- 16I employed the “involvement” measure only for quality circles.  For the remaining off-line reforms I used dummy variables indicating whether each was simply in the workplace.  The reason is most obvious for steering committees and committee systems, which involve representational participation, but I also found that the results for Information Sharing were stron- ger when the dummy variable was introduced.  Possi- bly,  it  serves  as  a  proxy  for  a  broader  culture  of openness and trust. HIGH PERFORMANCE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF WORK? 797 ables  than  have  typically  been  used  in prior research.17 Finally,  of  the  economic  AWPs,  Group Bonus is positively and significantly corre- lated with Belongingness, Empowerment, Job Satisfaction, and Commitment.  But in the  initial  (col.  2)  regressions  it  remains significantly  associated  with  only  Empow- erment and Commitment, while becoming negatively associated with Workload and Self-Esteem.  Profit-Sharing is significantly and  positively  correlated  with  Workload and Stressfulness, though it has only one statistically  significant  association  in  the initial regressions, a weak negative associa- tion with Citizenship Behavior.  The asso- ciations  between  Group  Bonus  and  both Workload and Self-Esteem are difficult to explain (possibly reflecting a causality prob- lem), as is the negative association between Profit Sharing and Citizenship Behavior. When Complexity is controlled for,  some of  the  findings  in  Table  6  are  weakened (see column 3).  In particular, Team-Based Work becomes statistically insignificant in the regression for Task Involvement.  Team Autonomy also becomes statistically insig- nificant  in  the  regressions  for  Belong- ingness, Task Involvement, Job Satisfaction, Motivation,  and  Citizenship  Behavior,  re- maining significant only in the regression for  Commitment.    These  changes  could reflect a tendency for team-based work and team autonomy to be implemented where work is already complex, although it is also possible  that  these  practices  operate through increased complexity.  Otherwise, however, controlling for Complexity does not  appear  to  substantially  alter  the  re- sults.18 Discussion and Conclusions The  results  suggest  that  conventional assumptions  of  proponents  and  of  many critics of AWPs are over-simplified.  In par- ticular,  these  results  indicate  that  AWPs tend to have a number of implications for employees, but these implications appear to  vary  depending  on  the  level  of  AWP involvement,  the  form  of  work  organiza- tion,  and  ultimately  the  specific  AWPs adopted. Relatively  moderate  levels  of  AWP  in- volvement appear to have largely positive implications,  as  reflected  in  increased belongingness, empowerment, task involve- ment, and ultimately in improved job satis- faction,  self-esteem,  motivation,  commit- ment,  and  organizational  citizenship  be- havior.  Yet, with the exception of motiva- tion and commitment, these positive impli- cations tend to diminish and even decline at higher levels of adoption.  This does not appear  to  be  explained  by  increased workload, as the level of AWP involvement does not appear to be associated with this variable.  It may, however, be explained by increased stressfulness, for which there is an association.  That is, even if high levels of AWP  adoption  potentially  allow  for  still greater  empowerment,  task  involvement, and belongingness, none of these benefits is  realized,  because  workers  are  in  effect overwhelmed by higher stress levels.  Thus, any initially positive implications of AWPs diminish. 17There  is  some  literature  arguing  that  off-line AWPs are more effective when accompanied by on- line AWPs (for example, Appelbaum and Batt 1994; Levine 1995).  But as discussed in fn. 9, when I tested for interactions between on-line and off-line reforms, I found no support for this argument.  I also reran the regressions  on  a  subsample  consisting  only  of  re- sponses  by  individuals  who  were  involved  in  team- based work to at least “some extent” (N = 279; results available on request).  There was little change in the results. 18Analysis of a subsample excluding managers and professionals (N = 310) did yield somewhat different results.  First, the negative implications of Re-Engi- neering were statistically significant in a larger num- ber  of  regressions  (decreased  Belongingness,  Self- Esteem, and Motivation), as were the positive implica- tions  of  Quality  Management  (increased  Belong- ingness and Job Satisfaction, and decreased Fatigue). Second,  the  coefficients  for  the  individual  reforms were weaker in a number of cases, particularly with respect to Team Autonomy and Team Responsibility. But overall, the pattern of relationships was the same, even if somewhat less pronounced, and it is likely that weaker associations reflect increased collinearity prob- lems associated with the inclusion of all AWPs, due to reduced sample variance and size. 798 INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW This finding is consistent with the litera- ture  on  the  effects  of  stress  (Brief  et  al. 1981; Quick and Quick 1984).19  It is also consistent, however, with Barker’s (1993) finding that high levels of AWP adoption may  engender  “concertive  control,” through which initial improvements in the work  experience  come  to  be  offset  by  in- creased  peer  pressures  and  heightened performance norms. Under the concertive control thesis, we might expect peer pres- sures and performance norms to be inter- nalized and hence reflected in higher mo- tivation and commitment on the one hand, yet a more stressful and diminished quality of  work  experience  on  the  other.    This could explain the finding of no statistically significant  diminishment  in  the  implica- tions  of  AWP  involvement  for  motivation and commitment despite increasingly stress- ful  work  and  declining  or  even  negative implications  for  empowerment,  involve- ment, belongingness, job satisfaction, self- esteem, and citizenship behavior. The results addressing the form of work organization  are  broadly  consistent  with the  results  for  the  level  of  AWP  involve- ment.  Although my operationalization of these forms is rudimentary, it appears that traditional  (that  is,  supervised)  group  or team  work  has  positive  implications  for employees, and that so-called lean, team, and post-lean forms of organization associ- ated  with  the  “high-performance”  model may  be  inferior  to  these  groups.    As  for AWP  involvement,  it  is  possible  that  this latter result indicates that these forms en- gender concertive control.  However, none of  the  high-performance  forms  is  associ- ated  with  either  stressfulness  or  commit- ment,  and  only  team  organization  is (weakly) associated with motivation.  Also of note is the finding that although these forms do appear to have some positive ef- fects  when  compared  to  traditional,  indi- vidualized forms of organization, these ef- fects  largely  disappear  when  other  AWPs are controlled for, suggesting that they are 19I thank an anonymous reviewer for this insight. attributable to other AWPs that tend to be adopted in their presence.  In contrast, the effects  of  traditional  group  work  do  not change. Analysis of the implications of individual AWPs further reinforces these general find- ings, indicating that JIT and work re-engi- neering, both of which are associated with the high-performance model, tend to have negative effects.  Team autonomy and re- sponsibility for specific goods or services, again commonly associated with the high- performance  model,  also  have  largely negative implications for employees.  In contrast, team-based work and informa- tion sharing have large positive implica- tions. The  findings  for  the  team-related  vari- ables are especially contrary to the assump- tions  of  high-performance  advocates  and may  represent  the  key  to  understanding both the findings of this paper and some of the problems that have been identified with AWPs in the literature.  It is possible that, in the  absence  of  an  immediate  supervisor, there is greater uncertainty and opportu- nity for disagreement over how to allocate and  perform  tasks,  increasing  individual insecurities  and  resulting  in  intra-group conflicts (Sinclair 1992:617–21).  In other words, as traditionally assumed in the lead- ership literature, it may be that “initiating structure” generally matters.  In turn, team responsibility may mean that output is more closely  evaluated  and  that  members  feel greater  pressure  to  perform,  thus  giving rise to heightened stress levels.  This would again  be  consistent  with  Barker’s  (1993) finding that autonomous teams give rise to concertive control, though it also suggests that Barker may have conflated the effects of  team  autonomy  with  those  of  team  re- sponsibility. Overall,  therefore,  the  results  suggest that, when compared to “bad” practice as- sociated  with  traditional  individualized work,  the  so-called  “best”  practice  associ- ated with high levels of AWP involvement, with lean and autonomous team work orga- nization,  and  with  the  provision  of  team autonomy  and  responsibility  may  have  a number of positive (as well as some nega- HIGH PERFORMANCE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF WORK? 799 tive) implications for employees.  But when compared to what might be referred to as “good” practice, or low to moderate levels of AWP adoption, and especially traditional group work organization and information sharing, their implications tend, if anything, to be negative.  It may be that so-called best practice often gives rise to concertive con- trol, under which workers are indeed sub- ject to a “new iron cage” (to use Barker’s adaptation of Weber’s famous metaphor). Although such a conclusion must be con- sidered tentative, the findings of this study do provide some support for it. A further possible explanation, one that extends Barker’s analysis, is that, at higher levels  of  AWP  adoption,  employees  may feel  themselves  under  increased  pressure to  exhibit  high  motivation  and  commit- ment,  yet  may  also  become  increasingly dissatisfied  with  the  pressures  placed  on them and distrustful of employer motives. Thus, the findings from this study may not reflect reactions to group pressures so much as they do reactions to employer-imposed ones that may in turn come to be manifest within groups.  In this regard, the problem with autonomous teams may be less one of initiating structure than of a tendency for distrust and discontent to come to the sur- face when employees work together with- out  supervision,  explaining  less  favorable evaluations  of  the  work  experience  and possibly giving rise to intra-group conflicts. Such  an  interpretation  calls  for  more  so- phisticated analysis than is possible in this paper.  However, it would be more consis- tent  with  a  conflict-oriented,  “political economy”  perspective  (Godard  1998, 2001c), accounting more fully for how the institutional design of the employment re- lation conditions the implications of AWPs. A number of caveats are, however, called for.    First,  it  may  be  that  the  observed negative effects of high levels of AWP adop- tion and of team autonomy reflect a failure of employers to adopt complementary HRM policies needed to ensure that workers are able to cope with high levels of discretion and responsibility.  Particularly important in this respect could be an unwillingness of employers  to  invest  in  sufficient  levels  of training,  possibly  because  of  the  costs  of doing  so.    Although  the  purpose  of  this paper has been to explore what the average effects  of  AWPs  appear  to  be  rather  than what they can be, there is thus clearly a need to investigate this and similar possibilities more fully (though subsequent analysis of the  data  from  this  study  suggested  that training does not matter: Godard [2001a]). There is also some possibility of omitted variables  bias.    For  example,  workplaces facing  a  threat  of  closure  may  be  more likely  to  adopt  high  levels  of  AWPs.    Yet employees may already experience stress- ful working arrangements in these environ- ments.    Though  this  link  should  to  some extent  be  proxied  by  workplace  growth/ decline, as included in this study, it could account  for  the  observed  association  be- tween AWP involvement and stressfulness, and possibly for the diminishing and even declining effects of high levels of AWP in- volvement.  It is also possible that the use of AWPs is still spreading and high levels of adoption are more likely to be recent, in which case any observed negative effects at these levels may reflect initial disruptions and uncertainty rather than high levels of adoption per se. A similar possible problem involves cau- sality.    It  is  possible  that  employers  are more likely to introduce high levels of AWPs where the work experience and outcomes of  employees  are  negative  to  begin  with, possibly  with  the  objective  of  creating  a more  positive  environment.    If  so,  it  may simply be that the observed negative asso- ciations for high levels of AWP reflect their limited  potential  for  effecting  positive change. Finally,  it  is  possible  that  the  implica- tions of AWPs for workers depend on the institutional conditions under which they are  adopted.    In  particular,  we  would  ex- pect  the  interests  of  workers  to  be  more thoroughly  incorporated  into  the  imple- mentation of this model where unions are strong, or where workers enjoy co-decision rights,  or  where  employers  are  free  from short-term  performance  pressures  and hence able to develop a longer-term per- spective (see Godard 2001b).  Such condi- 800 INDUSTRIAL AND LABOR RELATIONS REVIEW tions  largely  do  not  exist  at  present  in liberal market economies such as that of Canada (or, for that matter, the United States and United Kingdom), but they do exist in a number of European countries (for example, Germany and Sweden).  It is  possible  that  different  associations would  be  observed  in  these  countries, not only because employee interests are more likely to be taken into account, but also because trust levels are likely to be higher. These  and  other  possible  limitations point to the need for further research.  But if  taken  at  face  value,  the  results  of  this study strongly suggest that the implications of alternative work practices associated with the high-performance model may be more complex than commonly assumed, and that what many view as “best” practice for em- ployers  may  not  also  be  best  practice  for workers  (if,  indeed,  it  is  even  necessarily best for employers; see Godard 2001c).  If so,  attempts  to  promote  the  high-perfor- mance  model  as  a  means  of  enhancing “equity” as well as “efficiency” may be mis- guided, at least within the current institu- tional  context.    For  those  genuinely  con- cerned with quality of employment issues, advocacy of more broad-based institutional reforms  may  be  called  for  (see  Godard 2001b).

All bracketed items were thus excluded from scale creation and from the factor analysis reported here.  The original expectation was for a six-factor solution, but the Citizenship items loaded on two factors (6 and 7), the first including items associated with altruism and with civic virtue, the second including items associated with courtesy.  Only the items comprising courtesy yielded an index with an acceptable reliability score (.71).  However, this index did not perform as well as an overall index including all of the citizenship items. Because the reliability score for the overall index was unchanged (.71), the decision was to include it in the regressions reported in this paper. HIGH PERFORMANCE AND THE TRANSFORMATION OF WORK? 803 REFERENCES Adler, Paul.  1993.  “Time and Motions Regained.” Harvard Business Review, Vol. 71 (Jan.–Feb.), pp. 97– 108.
