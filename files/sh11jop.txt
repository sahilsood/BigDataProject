Customer Satisfaction as a Mediator of the   Turnover- Performance Relationship  Mahesh Subramony  Northern Illinois University  Brooks C. Holtom  Georgetown University                            We  developed  and  tested  a  model  examining  the  influence  of  unit-level  voluntary  and  involuntary  turnover  on  critical  performance  outcomes  within  a  relationship  based  business  context.  Utilizing  the  notion  of  relational  assets,  we  proposed  that  voluntary  and  involuntary  turnover  levels  disrupt  the  existing stock of relationships with customers thus negatively affecting customers’ satisfaction with the  firm, thereby decreasing unit-level financial performance. We tested our hypotheses using longitudinal  data related to voluntary and involuntary turnover of full-time staff, customer satisfaction, and financial  performance (net operating profits per employee) obtained from 46 regional offices of a temporary help  services (THS) firm. Consistent with our predictions, customer satisfaction with the THS firm mediated  the  relationship  between  both  voluntary  and  involuntary  turnover  rates  and  unit-level  financial  performance.    INTRODUCTION    While numerous research articles have been published examining the antecedents of turnover, few  have  examined  the  consequences  of  turnover  (Holtom,  Mitchell,  Lee,  &  Eberly,  2008).  This  research  reveals  that  high  levels  of  employee  turnover can  have  negative  effects on  business-unit  performance.  Specifically, there is support for the argument that voluntary turnover disrupts normal operations of the  firm (Staw, 1980) and engenders the loss of firm-specific human and social capital (Dess and Shaw 2001;  Shaw, Gupta, & Delery, 2005), thereby decreasing unit-level efficiency (Kacmar, Andrews, Van Rooy,  Steilberg, & Cerrone, 2006; Morrow & McElroy, 2007), customer service outcomes (Hausknecht, Trevor  &  Howard,  2009),  and  financial  performance  (Glebbeek  &  Bax,  2004;  Shaw,  Duffy,  Johnson,  &  Lockhart, 2005; Siebert & Zubanov, 2009). Similarly, involuntary turnover has been found to negatively  influence business outcomes including organizational efficiency (Zatzick & Iverson, 2006), profitability  (Guthrie & Datta, 2008), and stock prices (Nixon, Hitt, Lee, & Jeong, 2004). While several studies have  examined the relationship between turnover and unit-level performance, relatively few have theorized and  measured the mediators of the turnover-performance relationship for both voluntary (Holtom et al., 2008),  and involuntary (Datta, Guthrie, Basuil, & Pandey, 2010) turnover, and even fewer have attempted to test  these mediated relationships using longitudinal designs (Morrow & McElroy, 2007). There is a critical  need to examine the ‘black box’ or theoretical intermediaries of these effects.  Journal of Organizational Psychology vol. 11(1) 2011     49 We  address  this  gap  by  proposing  and  testing  a  model  where  customer  satisfaction  mediates  the  relationship between both forms of turnover and unit performance. Utilizing the notion of relational assets  (Srivastava, Fahey, & Christensen, 2001), we argue that high turnover levels can destabilize the existing  stock  of  relationships  between  business  units  and  their  customers,  leading  customers  to  evaluate  the  business unfavorably, and through their dissatisfaction, affect unit-level financial performance. Given that  83% of workers in the United States produce a service rather than a product (Lee & Mather, 2008) and  that  the  value  of  services  are  inextricably  linked  to  the  interaction  between  employees  and  customers  (Schneider & White, 2004), we believe it is critical to explore the role that effective service relationships  play in influencing financial performance. We developed our theoretical argument within the context of a  relationship-based  service  business—temporary  help  services  (THS)—and  tested  it  using  time-lagged  turnover, customer, and financial performance data gathered from 46 units of a THS firm in the US.    THEORY AND HYPOTHESES    Theorized Mechanisms for the Turnover-Performance Relationship  Three  theoretical  perspectives  predict  the  negative  influence  of  turnover  levels  on  organizational  outcomes.  First,  according  to  operational  disruption  theory  (Staw,  1980;  Hausknecht,  et  al.,  2009),  employee  departures  affect  “the  ability  of  others  to  produce  because  of  the  interdependence  of  work  roles” (Staw, 1980; p. 256), thus disrupting the normal operations of the unit and diverting unit-resources  (i.e.,  people,  time,  and  money)  toward  dealing  with  this  disruption.  Although  specific  forms  of  involuntary turnover (e.g., downsizing and layoffs) are typically initiated by firms in order to increase  their efficiency levels by reducing labor costs (Freeman & Cameron, 1993), empirical evidence instead  suggests efficiency reducing (Wagar, 1998; Zatzick & Iverson, 2006) or value-neutral (Baumol, Blinder,  &  Wolff,  2003)  effects.  Particularly  pertinent  to  our  study  is  the  finding  that  both  dismissals  and  reduction-in-force  initiatives  are  negatively  associated  with  customer  satisfaction,  productivity,  and  profitability (McElroy, Morrow, & Rude, 2001).  Second,  human  capital  theory  (Becker,  1964)  asserts  that  turnover  leads  to  the  depletion  of  firm- specific human capital and therefore to a decline in firm performance (Shaw et al, 2005). Because firm- specific human capital includes employees’ knowledge of “specific product features, service agreements,  pricing, packaging, promotions (and)…demand characteristics of particular individuals or segments (Batt,  2002; p. 588),” employee turnover can translate into a loss of customer-related knowledge and lead to  lowered levels of customer service (Liao, Toya, Lepak, & Hong, 2009).  Third, researchers focusing on social capital or the connections between members of an organization  view turnover as leading to the dissolution of key relationships between organizational members (Adler &  Kwon, 2002; Leana & VanBuren, 1999). Regardless of turnover type, loss of key members can lead to  communication  problems  within  the  firm’s  social  network  and  engender  a  loss  of  efficiency  in  communication and work flow (Shaw et al., 2005b), which are likely to translate into lowered levels of  customer satisfaction (Morrow & McElroy, 2007).  In the context of relationship-based service organizations such as THS firms, we believe that a fourth,  complementary, theoretical argument applies. In short, we contend that relationships with customers are a  critical resource for firms (Srivastava, et al., 2001). Considered in this light, high rates of turnover among  full-time,  permanent  staff  members  can  disrupt  the  ability  of  THS  firms  to  form  effective  service  relationships with their customers and, thereafter, financial performance.    Turnover Levels and Customer Satisfaction  Boundary spanning employees constitute a critical link between firms and their customers (Schneider  & Bowen, 1985; Bettencourt, Brown, & MacKenzie, 2005; Gelade & Young, 2005), and there is evidence  that  customers’  loyalty  to  the  firm  is  strongly  influenced  by  their  loyalty  to  the  firm’s  representatives  (Palmatier, Scheer, & Steenkamp, 2007). This is because repeated interactions with customers provide  employees  with  the  opportunity  to  develop  a  deeper  understanding  and  appreciation  of  individual  customers’  needs  and  preferences  (Liao  &  Subramony,  2008),  and  consequently  lead  them  to  exert  50     Journal of Organizational Psychology vol. 11(1) 2011 discretionary  effort  to  solve  customer  problems  (Bettencourt,  Gwinner,  &  Meuter,  2001).  These  discretionary  behaviors  are  typically  reciprocated  by  customers  in  the  form  of  attachment  directed  specifically  toward  the  employee  (Tax  &  Brown,  1998).  Through  frequent  interactions  over  time,  employees  and  customers  often  form  personal  bonds  or  relationships,  mutual  trust,  and  commitment.  Overall,  these  relationships  are  difficult  to  replace  (Hunt,  1997;  Hunt  &  Morgan,  1994).  The  loss  of  relationships can significantly disrupt the stock of relational assets accumulated by the firm, and lead to  customer dissatisfaction and defection (Bendapudi & Leone, 2001; Tax & Brown, 1998).  The interactions between THS firms and their customers are characterized by relational exchanges  (Dwyer,  Schurr,  &  Oh,  1987).  Customers  typically  interact  with  the  same  staff  for  the  identification,  placement, and management of multiple temporary employees. Over the course of this relationship, they  develop an understanding of each others’ contexts, capabilities, and vulnerabilities and become uniquely  suited  to  meet  each  others’  needs  (Druker  &  Stanworth,  2004).  In  addition,  over  the  long  term,  both  parties  receive  opportunities  to  develop  mutual  trust  and  commitment  (Hunt  &  Morgan,  1994),  and  establish mutually-acceptable relational norms (Palmatier, Dant, & Grewal, 2007). Staff turnover, in these  circumstances, could lead to customer dissatisfaction due to factors such as disruption in communication,  reduced  speed  of  response,  and  delays  in  execution  arising  from  disruption  of  the  firm’s  operations  amongt others.  While it can be argued that voluntary and involuntary turnover have different etiologies (Chatman,  1991; Mitchell et al., 2001; Shaw, Delery, Jenkins, & Gupta, 1998), they tend to have similar effects on  firm-customer relationships (Bendapudi & Leone, 2002). Organizational units that experience higher rates  of employee attrition are less likely to anticipate and deliver high-quality service (Hausknect et al., 2009)  because their employees lack the critical knowledge, skills, abilities, and customer relationships, unlike  organizations with lower attrition rates (Kacmar et al., 2006). Consequently, customers are more likely to  be dissatisfied with the received levels of service (Brown & Lam, 2008; Brown, Barry, Dacin, & Gunst,  2005; Zeithaml, Parasuraman, & Berry, 1990).    Hypothesis 1: The rate of unit-level voluntary and involuntary turnover will be negatively  related to customer satisfaction.    Customer Satisfaction and Unit Financial Performance  Current  literature  demonstrates  the  positive  effects  of  customer  satisfaction  on  key  customer  behaviors (Szymanski & Henard, 2001). Satisfied customers are likely to continue buying from the firm  in  spite  of  viable  alternatives  (Gustafsson,  Johnson,  &  Roos,  2005),  strongly  identify  with  the  firm  (Homburg, Wieseke, & Hoyer, 2009), and be more tolerant of service transgressions (Grégoire, Tripp, &  Legoux,  2009). These behaviors  have  been  found to  improve  firm-level  performance  through  two  key  routes. First, as a consequence of customer retention and loyalty, firms with higher levels of customer  satisfaction  enjoy  greater  revenue  growth  and  profitability  than  firms  with  lower  levels  of  customer  satisfaction  (Anderson,  Fornell,  &  Lehmann,  1994;  Smith  &  Wright,  2004).  Second,  customers’  propensity  to  stay  with  the  firm  and  provide  positive  word-of-mouth  reduces  the  need  to  attract  more  customers, which leads to a reduction in marketing and promotion expenses (Luo & Homburg, 2007). In  sum, customer satisfaction with the firm should enhance revenues and decrease expenses such that we  would expect higher levels of net operating profit.  Because net operating profit per unit could vary dramatically by the number of staff within the unit,  we utilize net operating profits divided by the number of full-time employees per unit (NOP/EE), as the  measure  of  unit-level  financial  performance.  This  measure  is  similar  to  labor  productivity  because  it  provides an estimate of per-employee contribution in the unit. It has an additional advantage as it controls  for one of the unit’s largest operating expenses (labor cost), making it ideal for service businesses such as  THS (Barber & Strack, 2005; Bryan, 2007).    Hypothesis  2:  Customer  satisfaction  will  be  positively  related  to  unit-level  financial  performance.  Journal of Organizational Psychology vol. 11(1) 2011     51 Based on the above rationale, we propose that the detrimental effect of both voluntary and involuntary  turnover on unit-level financial performance will be fully mediated by customer-satisfaction levels.    Hypothesis  3:  The  negative  relationship  between  unit-level  voluntary  and  involuntary  turnover  and  unit-level  financial  performance  will  be  fully  mediated  by  customer  satisfaction.    Recent  reviews  (e.g.,  Mathieu,  DeShon,  &  Bergh,  2008;  Wood,  Goodman,  Beckmann,  &  Cook,  2008)  have  noted  the  relative  lack  of  time-lagged  or  longitudinal  designs  in  testing  mediated  relationships. It takes time for the relationship-destabilizing effects of turnover to manifest in the form of  customer dissatisfaction, which, in turn, takes time to translate into unit-level performance. Although, it is  difficult to precisely pinpoint the amount of elapsed time for these effects to unfold, a review of the few  longitudinal  studies  suggest  that  a  one-year  time-lag  is  sufficient  for  detecting  these  effects  (Luo  &  Homburg, 2006; McElroy, et al, 2001).    METHOD    Sample and Procedure  Our sample consisted of 46 regional offices of a THS firm in the United States. This firm employs  1,485  (unit  mean  =  32;  SD  =  16)  full-time  staff  who  recruit  and  manage  430,000  contingent  workers  delivering  a  variety  of  limited-term  administrative,  and  professional/skilled  (e.g.,  quality  technician,  electronic assembly, computer programming, and accounting) services to over 40,000 client organizations  in the US. Each regional office in this sample was a semi-autonomous unit with its own annual objectives  and performance metrics. Voluntary and involuntary turnover data of full-time staff for these units were  obtained  for  an  18-month  period  (from  January  2005  to  June  2006)  for  all  46  units  in  the  sample.  Customer-satisfaction data for these units were collected in June 2007 (i.e., a year after the last wave of  turnover  data)  through  a  telephone-survey  of  a  random  sample  of  contact  persons  working  for  the  customer organizations. These surveys were conducted by a market-research company contracted by the  THS firm. Responses were received from 1,956 customers (n ~ 43 per unit). Financial performance data  (i.e., net operating profit per full-time employee) was obtained for 2008 from these units.    Measures  Turnover  Voluntary and involuntary turnover data were reported in the form of the proportion of full-time staff  voluntarily or involuntarily (i.e., terminations and discharges) leaving each unit. These proportions were  calculated by dividing the total number of staff voluntary and involuntary leaving each unit and dividing  these numbers by the average number of employees in each unit in the 18-month period from January  2005 to June 2006.    Customer Satisfaction  Customer satisfaction with the THS firm’s operations was measured using 3 items rated on a 5-point  Likert scale. Items included:  Your satisfaction with…“How well we communicate information that is  relevant to your staffing needs”, “How innovative we are in meeting your staffing needs”, and “Overall  satisfaction  with the  firm’s  service  delivery.”  This measure  is  similar to  others  used  to  capture  global  customer satisfaction (c.f., Netemeyer, Maxham, & Lichtenstein, 2010). The internal consistency of this  scale (Alpha = .88) was found to be high.    Financial Performance  Unit-level financial performance was measured using net operation profit (i.e., gross operating profits  minus operating expenses) for each unit divided by the number of full time staff at the end of the year  2008.  52     Journal of Organizational Psychology vol. 11(1) 2011 Control Variables  Based on previous evidence indicating that unit-size can affect the relationship between voluntary- turnover and customers’ service quality evaluations (Hausknecht, et al., 2009), we controlled for the size  of  the  regional  offices,  operationalized  as  the  number  of  full-time  staff  working  in  these  offices.  Additionally,  we  gathered  unemployment  data  for  the  year  2006,  reported  for  different  states  and  metropolitan  regions  by  the  Bureau  of  Labor  Statistics  (www.bls.gov),  and  explored  the  relationship  between regional unemployment rates and the other variables in our analyses.    Data Aggregation  All our analyses were conducted at the unit level (i.e., regional office). While turnover rates, financial  performance,  and  the  control  variables  were  a-priori  conceptualized  and  measured  at  the  unit  level  of  analyses, customer satisfaction data were acquired from the responses of individual customers. There is  ample precedent for aggregating customer data at the unit level of analyses (e.g., Schneider, White, &  Paul, 1998; Susskind, Kacmar, & Borchgrevink, 2003; Hausknecht, et al., 2009). Moreover, the THS firm  itself used aggregated data for its service improvement programs. Additionally, we conducted analyses to  ensure  that  customers  for  each  regional  office  evaluated  the  THS  firm  similarly.  We  did  this  by  calculating  the  inter-rater  agreement  of  customers  for  each  unit  using  within-group  correlation  (rwgj  ;  James, Demaree, & Wolf, 1984), and average deviation index (ADI; Burke, Finkelstein, & Dusig, 1999)  values. The rwgj value for customer satisfaction (Mean rwgj = .77; SD = .02) was found to be higher than the  recommended  cut-off  value  of  .70;  and  statistically  significant  at the p (cid:148)  .05  level  (Dunlap,  Burke,  &  Smith-Crowe, 2003). As opposed to rwgj indices, ADI values are assumed to reflect high levels of inter- rater agreement when they are lower than .83 for items utilizing a five-point scale. In our sample, the ADI  values for the customer satisfaction items ranged from .63 to .74. These values were at recommended  levels and also statistically significant at the p (cid:148) .05 level (Dunlap, et al, 2003). After obtaining empirical  support  for  aggregation,  means  of  individual  responses  of  customers  of  each  unit  were  calculated  to  obtain the unit-level customer satisfaction scores.    Data Analysis  All three hypotheses were tested using structural equations modeling (SEM) implemented in AMOS  13.0 (Arbuckle, 2009). Following SEM conventions, we created a latent customer satisfaction variable  with three item indicators, as well as four latent variables for voluntary turnover, involuntary turnover,  NOP/EE, and unit size (the control variable) each fully loading on a manifest variable (i.e., with the factor  loading set at 1.0). Two criteria need to be satisfied a priori in order to test for full mediation using the  SEM approach: (a) the antecedent, X should be correlated with the mediator (M; and (b) M should be  correlated with both X and the consequence Y (James & Brett, 1984; James, Mulaik, & Brett, 2006). An  inspection of table 1 reveals that both these criteria were met in the current data. In addition, unlike tests  for partial mediation (e.g., Barron & Kenney, 1986), a test of full-mediation does not require that X be  correlated  with  Y.  In  other  words,  the  non-significant  relationship  between  turnover  and  financial  performance does not preclude us from testing for full-mediation.    RESULTS    A  review  of  Table  1  reveals  moderate  to  high  correlations  between  voluntary  and  involuntary  turnover rates (r= .47; p = .001), both types of turnover and customer satisfaction (ranging from r= -.40 to  -.47), and customer satisfaction and net operating profits per employee (ranging from r= .44 to .55). Unit- size was found to be significantly correlated with customer satisfaction (ranging from r= -.40 to -.42) and  regional  unemployment  rate  was  found  to  have  non-significant  relationships  with  all  variables  in  the  study.  Therefore,  we  controlled  for  the  effect  of  unit-size  on  customer  satisfaction,  and  dropped  unemployment rate from our analyses.

We  found  that  the  hypothesized  model  ((cid:548)2  [11]  =  9,  p=.62; RMSEA = .01; CFI= .99; NFI = .95; PNFI = .37) demonstrated a significantly better fit ((cid:168)(cid:548)2 [1] =  54     Journal of Organizational Psychology vol. 11(1) 2011 30.9; p=.001) than the unmediated direct effects model ((cid:548)2 [12] = 39.9, p=.001; RMSEA = .23; CFI= .80;  NFI = .76; PNFI = .33). Also, the partial mediation model ((cid:548)2 [9] = 11.9, p=.22; RMSEA = .08; CFI= .98;  NFI = .93; PNFI = .30) demonstrated poorer fit than the mediated model and was discarded in favor of  the  latter.  The  significance  level  of  these  mediation  effects  was  tested  by  utilizing  the  bootstrapping  approach (Shrout & Bolger, 2002), recommended for detecting mediation effects in small and medium- size samples (MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002; Wood, et al., 2008). Following  Cheung and Lau (2008), we drew 500 random (with replacement) bootstrap samples of the observations  in  our  study  and  created  90%  confidence  intervals  for  our  mediation  effects  using  these  samples.  We  report the results of our analyses using the Bias Corrected (BC) percentile method (Mooney & Duval,  1993)  in  Table  2.  We  found  that  the  90%  confidence  intervals  for  the  mediation  effects  for  both,  the  voluntary turnover(cid:198)customer satisfaction(cid:198)NOP/EE (standardized indirect effect = -.21; 90% CI: -.35 to  -.01) and the involuntary turnover(cid:198)customer satisfaction(cid:198)NOP/EE (standardized indirect effect = -.19;  90% CI: -.36 to -.08) relationships did not include zero. These analyses provide support for Hypotheses 3.

This  squared voluntary turnover term failed to add incremental variance in both NOP/EE ((cid:507)R2 = .08; p=.194)  and customer satisfaction ((cid:507)R2 = .001; p=.978). Similarly, a squared involuntary turnover term failed to  predict additional variance over and above involuntary turnover for both NOP/EE ((cid:507)R2 = .02; p=.510)  and customer satisfaction ((cid:507)R2 = .001; p=.899). These results indicate the relationship between turnover  and these outcomes can be considered linear in our sample.    DISCUSSION    The  results  of  our  analyses  suggest  that  both  voluntary  and  involuntary  turnover  rates  have  statistically and practically significant negative effects on customer satisfaction. Specifically, voluntary  and  involuntary  turnover  each  accounted  for  approximately  5%  (sr2  =  .26)  and  6%  (sr2  =  .11)  of  the  variance in customer satisfaction. Examining the unstandardized path coefficients of these relationships, it  is also possible to conclude that a 1 point increase in voluntary turnover is likely to decrease customer  satisfaction by nearly 1 scale point (B=-.96; SE = .36) and a 1 point increase in involuntary turnover is  likely to decrease customer satisfaction by nearly 2 scale points (B=-1.98; SE = .66). Moreover, customer  satisfaction  accounted  for  nearly  27%  (R2  =  .27)  of  the  variance  in  unit  financial  performance—a  relationship that is practically significant such that a 1 point increase in customer satisfaction translates  into an increase of $73,235 in net operating profits per employee (B=73,235; SE = 28,378). In addition to  these direct effects, we also found that both voluntary and involuntary turnover had significant indirect  Journal of Organizational Psychology vol. 11(1) 2011     55 effects on unit-level financial performance. Specifically, a 1 point increase in voluntary turnover is likely  to indirectly predict a decrease of $690 in NOP/EE (B= -69033.55, SE= 39941.64), and a 1 point increase  in involuntary turnover can be linked to a decrease of $119 in NOP/EE (B= -118996.34; SE= 65513.63).  In sum, the practical or financial impact is significant.  Our  study  contributes  to  the  existing  body  of  research  by  providing  evidence  for  the  deleterious  effects  of  both,  voluntary or  involuntary  turnover  levels  on  unit-level  performance in the relationship- based  business  context.  In  addition,  by  demonstrating  that  customer  satisfaction  fully  mediates  the  relationship  between  turnover  and  unit-level  financial  performance,  we  have  taken  an  initial  step  in  clarifying  the  contents  of  the  ‘black  box’  between  turnover  and  its  performance-related  consequences  (Holtom et al., 2008). These findings and the underlying theoretical mechanisms are likely to generalize  to a majority of contexts where customers interact with the same employee more than once, and where an  understanding  of  a  customer’s  idiosyncratic  needs  is  critical  in  order  to  provide  high-quality  service.  These contexts include many personal service settings (e.g., financial services, healthcare, childcare, hair  dressers) as well business-to-business relationships (e.g., industrial suppliers, professional service firms).    Strengths, Limitations and Future Research Directions  One of the key strengths of this study is the use of a longitudinal dataset with time-lagged measures  (Kenny,  1979).  Recently,  Roe  (2008)  found  that  less  than  10%  of  all  studies  published  in  applied  psychology journals incorporated time into their theoretical framework and that fewer than 6% actually  tested the temporal aspects of theorized relationships. This study has additional methodological strengths  including the control of common source variance through the use of multiple data sources (Podsakoff, et  al.,  2003)  and  the  statistical  control  of  extraneous  variables  (e.g.,  unit  size)  that  could  affect  key  relationships (Cook & Campbell, 1979).  However,  it  is  important  to  acknowledge  a  few  limitations  as  well.  First  among  these  is  its  generalizability—a concern in any single-company study. This research was conducted in the THS setting  where employees and customers interacted frequently with each other and the customer had significant  input into the provision of the service—a role that has been termed ‘co-production’ by service researchers  (Bendapudi & Leone, 2003). In situations such as these, turnover is likely to affect customer evaluations  much  more  strongly  than  in  ones  where  employees  and  customers  do  not  interact  often  or  where  the  service  transaction  requires  only  limited  employee  involvement  (e.g.,  convenience-store  purchases).  Future studies are needed in contexts where deep bonds between employees and customers are difficult to  establish. Another limitation of this study is that we did not explore the differential effects of turnover for  customers with varying expectations from the firm. It is possible that customers who require high levels  of involvement with the THS firm (e.g., assistance in developing staffing plans, creating job descriptions,  and serving as the primary staffing source) would be more dissatisfied with the depletion of relational  assets than those who view the firm as an occasional source of contingent workers. Thus, there is a need  to  examine  various  moderators  of  the  turnover-customer  evaluations  relationship  including  customer  expectations and level of involvement with the firm. Further, we do not measure the specific factors that  cause customer satisfaction to decrease (e.g., disrupted communication, delays in execution, time required  to  build  new  relationships)  nor  do  we  measure  whether  the  impact  of  high  customer  satisfaction  influences more increase in revenues or decrease in expenses. Future studies that drill down one more  level would likely prove to be valuable for both researchers and practitioners.  While our findings highlight the importance of voluntary and involuntary turnover as predictors of  unit-level  performance,  future  research  also  should  be  focused  on  incorporating  predictors  of turnover  into  the  model.  Past  research  has  demonstrated  the  role  of  attitudinal  variables  in  predicting  turnover  levels at the individual level of analysis. We believe that unit-level variables such as the level and strength  of  high-commitment  human  resource  management  practices  (Shaw,  Gupta,  &  Delery,  2005;  Trevor  &  Nyberg, 2008) or collective job embeddedness (Felps, Hekman, Mitchell, Lee, Holtom, & Harman, 2009)  would similarly serve as predictors of turnover. Finally, it is possible that aggregate unit-level citizenship  behaviors  might  restrict  voluntary  turnover  levels  as  well  as  buffer  the  influence  of  turnover  on  key  performance outcomes (Erhart & Naumann, 2004).  56     Journal of Organizational Psychology vol. 11(1) 2011 In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the effect of both, voluntary and involuntary turnover rates  on unit-level business outcomes is mediated by the satisfaction levels of the firm’s customers. While the  importance  of  employee-customer  relationships  has  often  been  noted  in  both  applied  psychology  and  marketing literatures, our study highlights the importance of retaining customer-contact staff in order to  preserve the strategic advantage available to firms through the accumulation and use of this key relational  asset.
