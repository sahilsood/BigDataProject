The paper seeks to answer two key questions: (a) how does market demand inﬂuence a ﬁrm’s green product innovation? and (b) how can green product innovation affects ﬁrm performance? This study collected a total of 208 valid questionnaires from four leading foreign motorcycle ﬁrms in Vietnam. The empirical ﬁndings show that market demand is positively correlated to both green product innovation and ﬁrm performance; while green product innovation performance is also positively correlated to ﬁrm performance. In addition, this study also categorizes three types of green product innovation and discusses their effects on market demand and ﬁrm performance. Ó 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction In recent years, an increased debate and interest in green product innovation was clearly observed. Pujari (2006) points out that green product innovation is increasingly being portrayed as an opportunity; while some also considers it as a winewin logic of being ‘green and competitive’ (Porter and Linder, 1995). Examples of success stories are the Body Shop’s range of cosmetic products and Toyota’s hybrid car. However, Hall and Vredenburg (2003) argue that sustainable product innovation in these companies are either public policy induced or is market-driven. Nevertheless, the debate on what is sustainable or what compose a green product is still on-going (Chen, 2001; Berchicci and Bodewes, 2005). Although green product innovation does address environmental issues very explicitly, but it is far from certain whether these products can truly achieves market success (Pujari, 2006). Furthermore, there is little empirical support that clearly demon- strates how green product innovation affects ﬁrm performance. Some of the empirical ﬁndings demonstrated a positive relation- ship between product innovation and ﬁrm performance, whereas a signiﬁcant number of them indicated otherwise (Capon et al., * Corresponding author.

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jclepro.2012.01.001 1990; Koellinger, 2008; Tseng et al., 2008). In addition, Wei and Morgan (2004) also disputed that market demand could be an important factor in inducing green product innovation. Berthon et al. (1999) also added that market demand plays a critical role in ﬁrm’s innovation performance. However, they also pointed out that listening too closely to the voice of customers may impair ﬁrms’ innovation performance. Inkpen and Pien (2006) suggested that ﬁrms collaborating with rivals are more likely to perform better in innovation than they would otherwise and ﬁrms can accelerate their capability development by R&D cooperation which helps them to decrease the time and risk involved in product innovation. The conﬂicting ﬁndings actually illustrated a gap in green product innovation literature. To enhance our knowledge and understanding of green product innovation and to beneﬁt product designers, marketers, and senior managers, more research is needed. Therefore, this research aims to address this gap i.e. lack of empirical research in understanding the relationship of green product innovation, market demand, and ﬁrm performance. More speciﬁcally, the study addresses two important research questions: a) How does market demand inﬂuence a ﬁrm’s green product innovation? and (2) How can green product innovation affect ﬁrm performance? These issues have considerable signiﬁcance for the ﬁeld of sustainable operations and new product introduction. In essence, green pressures may provide a key channel in the 102 R.-J. Lin et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 40 (2013) 101e107 evolution of ﬁrms’ operations and new product introduction (NPI) strategy. An understanding of the strategic implications of market demand, green NPI and ﬁrm performance is therefore an important aspect in the context of operations management. There are a number of compelling reasons why Vietnamese motorcycle industry is the focus of this study. First, Vietnam is the world fourth largest motorcycle market. Thus, no operations or strategic theory can claim to be complete without Vietnam. Second, because Vietnam shares many important common development paths with developing countries like Indonesia, Philippine, and China. Hence, the Vietnamese experience can help shed light on future ﬁrm growth in Asia. Third, motorcycle industry is one of the main sources of pollution in Asia. Finally, Vietnam is an upcoming economic superpower; improved understanding of Vietnamese ﬁrms will have enormous practical implications for Western ﬁrms that have business dealings with them. The paper begins with a discussion on theoretical context and research propositions. Next, the empirical research method is described and the ﬁndings are discussed. Finally, the paper closes with implications for future research and practice. scarcity of resources (Zhu et al., 2007). Moreover, exhaust emis- sions, gasoline consumption, recycle and disposal of wastes, places much pressures on the natural environment. Recent global initia- tives on green and sustainable consumption have awakened Viet- namese consumers i.e. in choosing the most environmental friendly motorcycles. The green move, in a way, has shifted the motorcycle market competitive criteria from price to ‘green’, and created considerable opportunities in the motorcycle industry. A few researchers (Hoffmann, 2007; Zhu et al., 2008; Yung et al., 2011) argue that customers increasing awareness of environmental issues and expectation for gasoline savings have forced motorcycle manufacturers to innovate their products. Especially in incorpo- rating “green” into products and developing environmental friendly production programs. The development of green product innovation is becoming a need and an opportunity for ﬁrms to reduce the negative inﬂuences of production on the environment and gain competitive advantage with competitors (Dangelico and Pontrandolfo, 2010). In other words, green product innovation has become the critical basic for improving a large motorcycle enterprises’ productivity, by maintain their competitive advantage and achieving larger market share. 2. Vietnam motorcycle industry e a background 3. Theoretical context and research propositions Prior to 1990s, almost all motorcycles in Vietnam were imported and the market was rather small. Motorcycle industry gained signif- icant momentum when foreign ﬁrms begun investing in Vietnam after 1990s. In 1992, the ﬁrst motorcycle company established in Vietnam was Vietnam Manufacturing and Export Processing (VMEP), a subsidiary of Sanyang motor industrial Corp. DucTho (2011) points out that Vietnam has a huge motorcycle market potential and is the world fourth largest after China, India, and Indonesia. Recognizing the market potential, Japanese ﬁrms such as Suzuki, Honda and Yamaha have a strong presence in the Vietnam market. the motorcycle industry, Moreover, the government’s friendly localization policy further in encouraged the development of particular with the presence of Chinese motorcycle manufacturers in early 2000 (Jalaluddin, 2002; Tseng, 2011a, b). Thus, Vietnam becomes a ﬁerce competition market for Japanese, Taiwanese, and Chinese motorcycle manufacturers. The emergence of Chinese motorcycle manufacturers created an unprecedented change in the motorcycle market indicates that Chinese motorcycles are basic, but affordable to the general public at low prices. Thus, indirectly helps raise motorcycle ownership in Vietnam (see Fig. 1). landscape. DucTiep (2007) In contrast, there is a price to pay for the increasing motorcycle usage i.e. pollution. There are environmental issues at all stages of a motorcycle’s product life cycle. The need for raw materials led to Number of Vehicles in Vietnam Automobiles Motorcycles 30,000,000 25,000,000 20,000,000 15,000,000 10,000,000 5,000,000 0 5 9 9 1 6 9 9 1 7 9 9 1 8 9 9 1 9 9 9 1 0 0 0 2 1 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 3 0 0 2 4 0 0 2 5 0 0 2 6 0 0 2 7 0 0 2 8 0 0 2 9 0 0 2 Fig. 1. Motorcycle statistic in Vietnam. (source: Anh Nam, 2007; Hong Do, 2010). 3.1. Market demand Market demand is a critical factor in today’s business environ- ment. Fierce competitions in the market force ﬁrms to have ﬂexible strategies for their products and process (Chang and Chiu, 2007). Various studies have emphasized that customer beneﬁt and price are key elements for market demand (Kammerer, 2009; Zhou et al., 2009). Monroe (1990) points out that customers perceive value differently, thus their demands are diversiﬁed and heterogeneous. Zhou et al. (2005) further added that over time, customers will become more sensitive and fussy. Hence, ﬁrms must understand their target customers and anticipate the changing preferences of customers in order to meet market demand promptly and gain competitive advantage (Desarbo et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2009). and integrate environmental Zhou et al. (2009) show that customer preference can be inﬂuenced by price. Thus, customers’ requirements sometimes conﬂict with their price-consciousness. For instance, ‘green’ demand from customers may force manufacturers to introduce sustainable products friendly production processes. Nevertheless, many customers are unwilling to trade off product qualities for a product’s green attributes (Peattie, 2001). Additionally, customers’ requirements about green attributes may not align with their actual purchasing behavior (Wong et al., 1996; Kuckartz, 1998; Prakash, 2002). Hence, how to harmonize these factors in order to meet market demand is a big challenge for all existing manufacturing ﬁrms. Slater and Narver (1998) argue that when ﬁrms’ timely notice a gap between supply and demand in the market, the ﬁrms can carry out a breakthrough to ﬁll this constraint through successful innova- tions. Hence, innovation is becoming a critical mean for manufacturing ﬁrms to survive and improve market position (Bueno and Ordonez, 2004; Alegre and Chiva, 2008). In addition, Monjon and Waelbroeck (2003) found that customer collaboration has an insigniﬁcant impact on product innovation. Wei and Morgan (2004) posit that market orientation is a key criterion in successful new product performance. Triebswetter and Wackerbauer (2008) also argue that market demand is the necessary factor for environmental innovation. Chiou et al. (2011) identify that increasingly customers are more green conscious i.e. looking for products that are fuel efﬁcient, and environment friendly. Hence, innovation, especially green product R.-J. Lin et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 40 (2013) 101e107 103 innovation, is being adopted to meet market demand and gain a competitive advantage (Reinhardt, 1998). These discussions sug- gested that customers’ green value demand drives ﬁrms to innovate so that they can meet and beat the competition. Hence, H1: Market demand is positively associated with green product innovation performance H1a: Market demand is positively associated with environ- mental performance H1b: Market demand is positively associated with products H1c: Market demand is positively associated with economic performance Dangelico and Pontrandolfo (2010) report a signiﬁcant increase in green production innovation in today’s businesses. There are three main aspects of green product innovation on ﬁrm performance, namely a) environmental performance (Chiou et al., 2011; Awasthi et al., 2010); b) products (Li et al., 2010; Triebswetter and Wackerbauer, 2008); and c) economic performance (Zhu and Sarkis, 2004; Tseng et al., 2009). This discussion suggests that green product innovation has an impact on ﬁrm performance. Therefore: H2: Green product innovation performance is positively associated with ﬁrm performance H2a: Environmental performance is positively associated with 3.2. Green product innovation Nowadays product innovation has become a signiﬁcant means of ﬁrms’ survival and a weapon to sustain market competitive advantage (Gronhaug and Kaufmann, 1988). A good product innovation performance can help ﬁrms to improve market position, afﬁrm brand name, leapfrog competition, creates a breakthrough and attract new customers (Chandy and Tellis, 2000; Mu et al., 2009). Wagner (2005) found that focusing on improvements of environmental performance in terms of reducing (undesired) outputs (i.e. emissions) from production is unlikely to bring about a positive inﬂuence on economic performance beyond relatively low levels of environmental performance. However, the debate is still on-going whether the green product design is really improved the economic perfor- mance (Tyteca et al., 2002). Commission of the European Communities (2001) deﬁnes green product innovation as products that reduce the negative impacts and risks to the environment, utilize less resources and prevent waste generation in the product’s disposal phase. In other words, green product innovation not only protects the natural environ- ment, but also provides environmental beneﬁts higher than conventional products (Reinhardt, 1998). impact on the environment Moreover, EEIG (2004) points out that product innovation have the biggest (Hoffmann, 2007; Kammerer, 2009). Poor product design and environmental stan- dards of developing countries (i.e. in the product’s disposal phase) could turn waste issues into serious problems in the future (Puckett and Smith, 2002; Greenpeace, 2005). Hence, many ﬁrms are inte- grating “green” into product innovation in order to achieve differ- entiation from competitors and gain a competitive advantage (Reinhardt, 1998). Thus, green product innovation can serve as a means for ﬁrms to gain sustainable development and achieve their business targets. ﬁrm performance H2b: Green Products performance is positively associated with ﬁrm H2c: Economic performance is positively associated with ﬁrm performance 3.3. Firm performance Reputation and market position are among the most important competitive factors for manufacturing ﬁrms. Tseng et al. (2009) show that many ﬁrms are beginning to realize the importance of sustainable development, as well as the deterioration of the global environment. Nevertheless, applying it to ﬁrm’s business activities is not certain and easy. Consequently, ﬁrms must integrate these issues to ensure survival and development in the market. This is especially true in the motorcycle industry where environmental issues are becoming the main concern (Hoffmann, 2007). However, Berthon et al. (1999) show that there are conﬂicting results between market demand and ﬁrm performance. Market plays a critical role in ﬁrm’s innovation performance but a ﬁrm’s performance does not necessarily depend on it. However, market demand is the key to ﬁrm performance in the market place. Atuahene-Gima et al. (2005) conﬁrmed that working closely with customers, and particularly inﬂuential customers a ﬁrm may uncover latent customer needs. Oltra and Jean (2009) argue that pollution and environmental criteria have a little impact on customers’ preferences. On the contrary, fuel consumption and price are the important criteria to be considered in their purchase behavior (Meyer and Clavel, 2006). Hence, manufacturing ﬁrms that pioneer in their green products will take the “ﬁrst mover advantage” and meet customers green demand. Hence: H3. Market demand is positively performance associated with ﬁrm Fig. 2 shows the relationship among market demand, green product innovation and ﬁrm performance. Fig. 2. Conceptual framework. 104 4. Methodology 4.1. Data collection R.-J. Lin et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 40 (2013) 101e107 Table 1 Questionnaire variables. To test the hypotheses, this study selected the Vietnam motor- cycle industry as the empirical setting. It is not practical to survey all the motorcycle manufacturers in Vietnam. Thus, in this study, two criteria were used to narrow down the potential manufacturers to be targeted in the survey, namely: a) Green e these ﬁrms should have a diversity of ‘green’ motorcycle models; and b) Market e these ﬁrms should be a signiﬁcant player in the Vietnam motor- cycle market. Upon close scrutiny, only four major motorcycle ﬁrms in Vietnam i.e. one local and three foreign ﬁrms were identiﬁed to meet the selection criteria. Prior to data collection, the survey instrument was pre-tested for content validity in two stages. In the ﬁrst stage, six experienced researchers were asked to critique the questionnaire for the ambi- guity, clarity and appropriateness of the items used to operational- ized each construct (Cooper and Schindler, 2001), based on feedback received from these researchers, the instrument was modiﬁed to enhance clarity and appropriateness of the measures purporting to tap the constructs. In the second stage, the survey instrument was mailed to ﬁve management executives afﬁliated with the motorcycle industry. These executives were asked to review the questionnaire for structure, readability, ambiguity and completeness. The data for the empirical investigation obtained through a ﬁeld study. Data were collected from 208 participating ﬁrms and gather information from relative departments, predominantly via face-to- face interviews with executives in charge of the manufacturing function from selected ﬁrms in Vietnam. Since the administrators are widely believed to provide reliable information regarding the basic knowledge of market demand, green product innovation, and ﬁrm performance. The ﬁnal survey instrument incorporated feed- back received from these executives, which enhanced the clarity of the instruments. This process yielded a survey instrument that was judged to exhibit high content validity. The interview took place gradually from January to July 2011. This study utilized a multiple-source approach in identifying the respondent list. Only respondents that have knowledge of market demand, green product innovation, and ﬁrm performance will be targeted. The respondents of the questionnaires included CEOs, Manufacturing Director, Marketing Director, and R&D managers. The respondents were asked to return the completed questionnaires through email. Questionnaire was initially developed in the English version. To ensure conceptual equivalence, it was translated into Vietnamese and then back-translated into English by independent translators. The questionnaire survey items were based on existing literature. Before mailing to the respondents, three experts were asked to pre-test the questionnaire. Feedback from the experts was used to improve the questionnaire. In the second pre-test, the revised questionnaires were e-mailed to eight CEOs or managers of customer care, marketing, manufacturing, and management and research and development (R&D) departments in different motor- cycle ﬁrms. They were asked to ﬁll in the questionnaire and identify any vagueness in the survey items. A ﬁve-point Likert scale with 1 representing “strongly disagree” to 5 representing “strongly agree” was adopted in this study.

It means that if a ﬁrm manages the market demand well, then its green product innovation performance and ﬁrm performance will improve. Hence, investment in environmental performance, prod- ucts and economic performance combining with a better under- standing about customers’ requirements is helpful to businesses. Indeed, manufacturers should understand the market demand and implement green product innovation in order to improve their position as well as reputation. 6. Managerial implications This study is ﬁrst of its kind to investigate the effects of market demand, green product innovation performance and ﬁrm perfor- mance in Vietnamese motorcycle industry. This sector is particu- larly important because Vietnamese motorcycle market is the four largest in the world (DucTho, 2011). Moreover, there are few studies exploring the impact of Vietnamese motorcycle manufacturing industry and sustainability operations, and green product innovation. Although previous studies had paid much attention to explore the relevant issues of market and proposed the concepts of green product innovation in different industries, there was no study that explored the relationship between market demand, green product innovation performance and ﬁrm performance, especially in the motorcycle industry. Hence, this study addresses the argument by proposing a framework integrating market demand, green product Table 6 Results for hypotheses. Hypotheses H1a: Market demand is positively associated with environmental performance H1b: Market demand is positively associated with products H1c: Market demand is positively associated with economic performance H2a: Environmental performance is positively associated with ﬁrm performance H2b: Green products is positively associated with ﬁrm performance H2c: Economic performance is positively associated with ﬁrm performance H3: Market demand is positively associated with ﬁrm performance Support (Yes/No) Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes product innovation in order to improve their organizational performance. The cronbach’s alpha was calculated to test the reliability of the questionnaire (see Table 3). The cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient of “market demand” is 0.84, environmental performance is 0.71, green products is 0.76, “economic performance” is 0.76 and ﬁrm perfor- mance is 0.79. In general, the cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcients of all ﬁve constructs are more than 0.7. Hair et al. (1998) argue that the minimum requirement of cronbach’s alpha coefﬁcient is 0.7. Thus, reliability of the measurement of this study is acceptable and highly consistent. 5.2. Reliability measures and correlation coefﬁcients Table 4 shows the results of the correlation coefﬁcient analysis. It shows that market demand has signiﬁcant positive correlations with environmental performance, green products, economic performance, and ﬁrm performance. Moreover, there were signif- icant positive correlations among environmental performance, products, economic performance with ﬁrm performance. 5.3. Regression analysis Table 5 shows the results of the regression analysis. In Model I, Model II and Model III, the results show that market demand was positively correlated to the three types of green product innovation performance: environmental performance, products and economic performance. Hence, H1a, H1b and H1c were supported in this study. In Model IV, the results show that market demand, envi- ronmental performance, products and economic performance were positively correlated to ﬁrm performance. Accordingly, H2a, H2b, H2c and H3 were supported in this study. In addition, this research also veriﬁed that the three types of green product innovation had partial mediation effects between market demand and ﬁrm performance. This study found that market demand had positive effects on environmental performance, products, economic performance and ﬁrm performance. In general, the results in Table 6 shows green product innovation had positive effect on ﬁrm performance. The empirical ﬁndings Table 4 Correlation coefﬁcient matrix.

Lin et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 40 (2013) 101e107 innovation performance, and ﬁrm performance. Moreover, this study also explores how the three main constructs of green product innovation performance: environmental performance, green products and economic performance and their effects on market demand and ﬁrm performance. The empirical ﬁndings show that market demand has signiﬁcant effects on both green product innovation performance and ﬁrm performance. In addition, the results also show that green product innovation performance had positive correlation with ﬁrm perfor- mance. Hence, hypothesis 1, 2, and 3 were supported in this study. In other words, the more a ﬁrm considers its market demand; the better will be its green product innovation performance and ﬁrm performance. This research also veriﬁed that the three types of green product innovation performance had (positive) partial mediation effects between market demand and ﬁrm performance. This study provides both theoretical and methodological contributions to existing sustainability body of knowledge, espe- cially in the motorcycle industry in Vietnam. In a highly competitive market, obviously, implementing green product innovation is necessary in order to differentiate a ﬁrm product and to achieve competitive advantage. However, the ﬁndings of this study suggest that ﬁrms should ﬁrst understand consumers’ requirements, and then align green product innovation initiatives with consumers’ values. fuel consumption, exhaust emission, price and identity (brand and design) are the key criteria that consumers will consider when purchasing a motor- bike. Fuel (especially gasoline) is scarce and its price is ever increasing. Consumers also wanted products to be produced in the most environmental friendly ways. Thus, the success of a ﬁrm green product innovation is depending on its appreciation of market demand as well as sustainable business operations. In today’s green conscious market, The ﬁndings of this study also indicate that motorcycle ﬁrms should pay attention to their products and economic performance, in addition to environmental performance. Environmental perfor- mance is just an outcome while products and economic perfor- mance are necessary conditions for achieving green product innovation performance. Manufacturers should enhance quality, as well as developing new environmental friendly motorbike tech- nology in order to surpass competitors and establish a leadership position. Design of new motorbikes should be impressive, eye- catching and practical (i.e. its U-box must be large to store one or two helmets). In addition, ﬁrms should reduce unnecessary costs in the production in order to keep the price low and be consistent with consumers’ needs. In other words, this study demonstrated that green product innovation is an important strategy for motor- cycle manufacturing ﬁrms to gain competitive advantage, attract more customers and improve market position, if they were able to understand market demand well. 7. Conclusion The empirical ﬁndings show that market demand had signiﬁ- cant effects on both green product innovation performance and ﬁrm performance. In addition, the results also indicate that green product innovation performance has positive correlation with ﬁrm performance. Hence, all hypotheses in this study were supported. In contrast, market demand dictates green product innovation performance, and hence ﬁrm performance. Achieving environ- mental performance, improving products and economic perfor- mance are also critical to businesses in general, and motorcycle manufacturing industry in particular. For managers, this study underscores the strategic importance of green product innovation decisions and demonstrates that green product innovation and ﬁrm performance should incorporate considerations related to the access of knowledge about market demand characteristics. This result emphasizes that ﬁrms may need to focus market demand in Vietnam in order to understand the complicated and interrelated criteria of market demand, green product innovation and ﬁrm performance and determine demand for green products. When market demand knowledge is specialized to a given R&D direction and hard to transfer to green product innovation in other countries, the beneﬁts of green product inno- vation may lead to ﬁrm performance. Results reported here, which focus on green product launches provide evidence that the later mechanisms is, in fact, occurring: ﬁrms are innovating more to meet the needs of their market. This study contributes to the existing body of literature in two ways. First, the research pioneers the effort in taking market demand perspective in understanding how customer value affects a ﬁrm’s green product innovation orientation and consequently its organization performance. Second, this study considers customer reactions to motorcycle manufacturers’ market offerings (new production introduction). The results indicate that a ﬁrm excels in green innovation can attain higher levels of market performance. In other words, it is vital to meet customers demand in enhancing organization performance. This study is not without its limitation, as the main focus is on the motorcycle manufacturing industry in Vietnam. However, the ﬁndings of this study could be generalized to other motorcycle markets, especially in Asia. Further studies could include other industries in Vietnam (such as automotive) or a comparison study with other country (such as China). The variables of three main constructs were chosen from literature reviews and may not be comprehensive. Future studies may include wider variables to examine the effects of market demand, green product innovation and ﬁrm performance in more depth.
