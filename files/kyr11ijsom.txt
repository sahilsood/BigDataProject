Since GSCM involves transferring green knowledge  and standardising production and delivery processes, the success of joint efforts  among supply chain partners hinges on how tightly the trust relationship with  partners  is  woven.  This  study,  based  on  125  companies  from  South  Korea,  shows  that  GSCM  orientation  positively  influences  firm  performance  via  supply  chain  partners’  trust  and  information  sharing.  This  research  suggests   the significance of solid trust relationship among supply chain partners in the  course of implementing and pursuing GSCM.

Environmental  regulations  have  taken  effects  worldwide  and  stronger  directives are being given consideration for implementation. Global warming seem to be  in effect in global scale and, as a result, more consumers are concerned about business  ethics.  Furthermore,  firms  began  to  view  GSCM  as  an  strategic  choice  to  streamline  manufacturing and distribution processes to increase the bottom line. GSCM focuses on  embedding  efficiency  into  the  supply  chain  through  waste  reduction  and  product  and  service  innovation,  which  necessitates  joint  supply  chain  efforts  with  suppliers,  distributors  and  customers.  Since  GSCM  involves  transferring  green  knowledge  and  standardising production and delivery processes, the success of such joint efforts among  supply chain partners highly hinges on how tightly trust relationship is woven and how  securely  product  and  risk  information  is  shared  among  the  partners.  Although  prior  research  on  sustainability  has  delved  into  the  issues  in  product  design,  producer’s  responsibility and environmental policy, few studies have investigated the role of trust  and information sharing in aligning GSCM orientation in a supply chain. This study aims  at investigating two research questions:   •  Does the implementation of GSCM positively affect firm performance?   •  Do trust and information sharing play a positive role in enhancing firm performance?   The first research question purposes to ascertain whether or not GSCM is associated with  firm performance. The positive influence of green management has been reported mainly  in  Europe  and  North  America  (van  Hock,  1999;  Rao  and  Holt,  2005;  Vachon  and  Klassen, 2006; Markley and Davis, 2007), but there are few studies that show its impact  in  Asia.  The  second  research  question  touches  the  information  sharing  practices  in  GSCM.  Although  prior  research  recognised  information  sharing  as  an  underpinning  enabler of supply chain management (Panteli and Sockalingam, 2005; Li and Lin, 2006;  Cheng et al., 2008; Markley and Davis, 2007; Hansmann and Cludia, 2001; Madu, 1996),  most research dealt with general information sharing. Few studies have differentiated risk                                                                                                                          Green Supply Chain Management orientation  285 information  sharing  from  general  information  sharing  and  investigated  their  differing  roles.  This  research  makes  three  important  contributions.  First,  this  study  provides  a  framework for understanding how green management increases firm performance from  the  trust  and  information  sharing  perspective.  This  paper  defines  green  management  orientation in a supply chain context and examines its impact on firm performance that is  mediated  by  trust  and  information  sharing.  Second,  this  study  takes  a  deeper  look  at  information  sharing.  General  information  sharing  has  drawn  much  attention  in  various  contexts  from  product  design  to  organisational  behaviour.  In  addition  to  general  information  sharing,  this  study  sheds  light  on  the  significance  of  risk  information   sharing and its impact on performance. Third, this research pays close attention to firm  performance.  Firm  performance  was  classified  into  three  sub-constructs:  customer  performance, operational effectiveness, and financial performance. These differentiated  performance measures help to grasp the impact of green management orientation in more  details. We believe that the empirical study from 125 companies from South Korea also  shows a glimpse of green management penetration in Asia.  The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 develops a theoretical  model  and  hypotheses.  Section  3  presents  research  methodology  regarding  the  data  collection  process  and  analysis  method  used  in  this  study.  Section  4  explains   the  outcomes  of  hypotheses  tests,  and  the  final  section  discusses  conclusions,  the  implications, and future research directions.  2  Theory development  2.1  Theoretical background  2.1.1  GSCM orientation  Environmental  issues  have  had  great  impacts  on  industrial  management  systems  and  styles. Since the late 1920s, a managerial paradigm, ‘green management’, has helped to  guide  companies  to  cope  with  environmental  issues.  GSCM  is  defined  as  a  set  of  practices intended to effect, control and support environmental performance by allocating  possible  human  material  resources  and  redefining  organisational  responsibilities  and  procedures. GSCM allows companies to minimise wastes and pollution production and   at the same time helps them to develop an overall ethos of environmental sustainability.   A number of factors have increased pressures for firms to respond to environmental  issues.  Such  factors  international  environmental  conventions, fortified environment-related laws, and consumer-oriented social values that  emphasise the preservation of nature. Consequently, GSCM has received much attention  from both researchers and practitioners.   include  agreements  made  by  GSCM orientation has been defined in various ways. Godfrey (1998) defines it as a  tool  to  improve  the  environmental  performances  of  supply  chains.  Narasimhan  and   Carter  (1998)  term  it  as  cooperation  among  purchasing  departments  to  enhance  the  environmental  friendliness  of  supply  chains  through  solutions  such  as  recycling  and   the  use  of  alternative,  non-hazardous  materials.  Qinghua  and  Joseph  (2004)  view  an  environment-friendly  industrial  structure  as  a  set  of  industries  and  production  systems  that  minimise  the  use  of  resources  and  maximise  recyclable  resources.  The  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development  puts  much  emphasis  on  the  implementation  of                                                                                                                       286    J.H. Kim et al.  eco-efficiency,  accumulating  ‘Clear  Production’  as  an  axis  of  successful  sustainable   development.  Drawing  from  these  previous  researches,  this  study  defines  GSCM  orientation as a set of business philosophy and practices intended to control and support  improvement of environmental results in a supply chain.  2.1.2  GSCM orientation in South Korea  South Korea, one of the top 13 countries in terms of economic scale, has increased its  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) largely from its export to the world (61.3% of GDP in  2007). It was probably Phenol leakage accident in 1991 that evoked people’s awareness  to  the  harms  of  firms’  environmental  mismanagement  and  their  social  responsibilities.   In the past, however, the Korean government and firms had not given serious thought to  environmental  issues  because  green  agendas  were  deemed  secondary  to  economic  growth. With environmental directives such as RoHS, ELV, WEEE, REACH, and EUP  taking  effect  worldwide  (Rao,  2002,  2004;  Zhu  and  Sarkis,  2004;  Zhu  et  al.,  2004;   Rao  and Holt, 2005), South Korea began to perceive green management as a strategic  priority.  Since  the  economy  heavily  relies  on  export  to  the  world,  the  government  recognised that it has to take active actions toward green management movement. This  realisation drove the South Korean government to pay careful attention to environmental  practices for companies.  Korean  government  initiated  to  build  a  supply  chain  environment  management  programme that encourages participating companies from major industries to proactively  address  those  green  issues  together.  Under  this  programme,  the  Korean  government  launched  “green  partnership  building  project”  for  companies  from  July  2003  to  June,  2006. Both large and small-medium companies that took part in this project came to build  and  launch  GSCM  in  their  respective  companies  with  75%  budget  support  from  the  implementation.1  Global  Korean  companies  such  as  Samsung  government  for  Electronics, POSCO, LG Electronics, Hyundai Automotive, and SK have embarked on  GSCM vigorously since.  2.1.3  Partner’s trust  Trust  is  the  belief  that  there  is  no  disadvantage  in  sharing  information.  Dyer  (1997)  defines trust as the mutual belief among business people that they will not take advantage  of  their  partners.  His  study  conducted  an  experiment  to  measure  trust  in  the   supplier-buyer relationship setting. Extending to supply chain level, trust among partner  companies can be defined as the belief that cooperation and collaboration bring positive  effects, not negative ones.  Trust  in  partners  is  the  expectation  that  their  actions  will  be  positive, constructive,  and  not  detrimental  (Sako,  1991).  Gulati  (1995)  differentiates  such  knowledge-based   trust  from  deterrence-based  trust.  While  deterrence-based  trust  is  rooted  in  fear,  knowledge-based trust is rooted in the confidence gained from information, and evolves  over time.  Based on these studies, partner’s trust is defined as the extent to which participants in  supply  chain  are  willing  to  count  on  each  other  for  mutual  interests  and  problem  resolutions (Mentzer et al., 2001; Dyer and Singh, 1998; Kale et al., 2000).                                                                                                                              Green Supply Chain Management orientation  287 2.1.4  Information sharing  In  today’s  highly  competitive,  globalised,  uncertainty-filled  environment,  companies  have  a  particularly  hard  time  making  decisions;  however,  information  sharing  among  companies can help to alleviate such uncertainty (Bensaou, 1997). Information sharing is  one  of  the  important  factors  in  the  supply  chain  and,  accordingly,  many  studies  on  information  sharing  have  been  conducted  (e.g.,  Dyer,  1996;  Marien,  2000;  Hur  et  al.,  2004).  Monczka  and  Morgan  (1998)  define  information  sharing  as  an  official  or  unofficial  sharing  of  valuable  information  among  or  within  companies.  Dyer  (1996)  defines  information  sharing  as  mutual  sharing  among  suppliers,  buyers,  and  others  concerned.  Drawing  on  these  studies,  information  sharing  is  defined  as  the  scope,  frequency and intensity to which critical and proprietary information is communicated to  participating entities (Christine et al., 2003; Zsidisin, 2003; Balsmeier and Voisin, 1996;  Noble, 1997; Mentzer et al., 2001; Youn et al., 2008).  Information  sharing  can  be  further  differentiated  into  risk  and  product  information  sharing.  Risk  information  sharing  involves  making  available  to  supply  chain  partners   the current status of the inventory level, faulty materials, market volatility, transportation  delay,  limitations  in  production  and  purchases,  and  labour  disputes.  In  an  uncertainty  prevailing environment, risk information sharing is crucial to effectively manage supply  chains.  Product  information  sharing  includes  knowledge  about  product  records,  new  product  development,  break-up  of  products,  and  product  quality.  Product  information  sharing reduces uncertainty, clarifies targets, and increases timeliness (Hong et al., 2004).   2.1.5  Performance  Performance  is  a  comprehensive  construct  to  measure,  especially  in  a  supply  chain  setting. Gunasekaran et al. (2004) introduce the multi-facets of supply chain performance  in  six  dimensions:  order  planning,  supplier  management,  production  effectiveness,  product  delivery  performance,  customer  service,  and  return  on  investment.  This  study  focuses  on  three  dimensions  of  performance,  namely,  customer  service,  production  effectiveness,  and  financial  performance.  Customer  service  and  product  effectiveness  reflect  the  impact  of  green  orientation,  and  financial  performance  shows  the  practical  validity of green orientation for firms. Table 1 shows the definitions and literature base of  each construct.

(2008)  Narasimhan and Jayaram (1998),  Hewitt (1999), Gunasekaran et al.  (2001) and Li et al. (2005)  2.2  Hypotheses  Figure 1 portrays a research model, which depicts how GSCM orientation impacts firm  performance.  Risk  and  partner  information  sharing  and  trust  mediate  between  GSCM  orientation and firm performance. The more a trustful relationship is built within a supply  chain, the more information can be shared, which helps supply chain partners to convey  green orientation through the supply chain and increase performance.  Figure 1  Research model    2.2.1  GSCM orientation and partner’s trust  Green  supply  chain  orientation  aims  at  improving  economic  and  environmental  performance concurrently. This purpose drives firms to form a green supply chain where  they purchase environmentally superior products and implement practices in accordance  with ISO 14000 standards that are designed to minimise waste and increase operational  efficiency. To successfully embed such practices into supply chains, it is critical for firms  to help supply chain partners to develop such capabilities for sustainability in the form   of training programmes and by transferring and sharing green knowledge (Cheng et al.,  2008). This process of disseminating green orientation throughout a supply chain cannot  be implemented without the trust that partners will not take advantage of such efforts but  cooperate to produce positive outcomes (Spekman et al., 1998; Zhu and Cote, 2004; Dyer  and Singh, 1998). Therefore,   H1: GSCM orientation is positively related to partner’s trust.                                                                                                                          Green Supply Chain Management orientation  289 2.2.2  GSCM orientation and information sharing  Seamless flow of information in scope, frequency, and intensity plays an essential role in  supply  chain  management  (Youn  et  al.,  2008).  Implementing  green  orientation  often  requires  firms  to  share  process  knowledge  with  supply  chain  partners  and  standardise  manufacturing  and  delivery  practices.  The  more  firms  partake  in  green  orientation,   the  more  information  sharing  will  flow  in  a  supply  chain  including  confidential  information and product information (Cheng et al., 2008; Balsmeier and Voisin, 1996;  Towill, 1997). Therefore,  H2:  GSCM  orientation  is  positively  related  to  the  sharing  of  partners’  (a)  risk  information and (b) product information.   2.2.3  Partner trust and information sharing  Trust  affects  organisational  learning  and  competitive  advantage  (Dodgson,  1993;  Dyer  and Singh, 1998) as well as the extent (Johnson et al., 1996; Inkpen and Beamish, 1997)  and efficiency of knowledge acquisition (Kogut, 1988; Parkhe, 1993). When acquiring  information  from  trustworthy  partners,  little  time  and  effort  is  spent  in  screening  and  verifying the quality of information. Furthermore, Gulati (1995) suggests that in order to  acquire  more  and  better  value  from  available  information,  information  providers  and  information obtainers have to establish high transparency between them, meaning higher  level of partner’s trust. Without reliable inter-organisational relationships based on trust,  commitment, and shared visions, firms will be reluctant to share information with their  supply chain partners, given the fear of information spills and the resultant loss of power  over competitors. Therefore,  H3: Partner’s trust is positively related to the sharing of (a) the risk information and  (b) the product information.   2.2.4  Partner trust and performance  Trust relationship with supply chain partners precedes effective customer service and the  minimisation  of  wastes  in  production  and  delivery  processes;  lack  of  trust  among  suppliers and manufacturers impedes them from forming partnerships (Li and Lin, 2006),  which increases uncertainty and decreases synergic cooperation in a supply chain. Once  established, trust enables supply chain partners to utilise their resources more effectively,  to lessen uncertainty in the communication and material transformation process, and to  cope with abrupt changes and dangers more flexibly. For example, Metze (1997), after  investigating  successful  companies,  suggested  that  trust  between  partners  played  an  essential  role  in  integrating  management  team  with  an  information  system.  Mariotti  (1999) suggested credibility among channel members as a success factor in an effective  supply chain system. Therefore,   H4:  Partner’s  trust  is  positively  related  to  (a)  customer  service  performance,   (b) operational effectiveness, and (c) financial performance.                                                                                                                              290    J.H. Kim et al.  2.2.5  Information sharing and performance  Seamless GSCM depends on how effectively information is shared among supply chain  partners.  Information  sharing  is  one  of  five  building  pillars  that  solidify  supply  chain  relationships,  help  firms  to  understand  customers’  needs,  make  the  supply  chain  more  responsive to market change, and increase operational efficiency (Lalonde, 1998; Stein  and  Sweat,  1998,  Li  et  al.,  2005).  By  sharing  confidential  information  and  product  information such as transportation delay, faulty materials, labour disputes, and limitations  in purchases, firms can have a broader view of the supply chain, making decision-making  processes quicker and more accurate. Thus, information sharing is essential for achieving  a stronger, more competitive supply chain (Christopher et al., 2004). Therefore,  H5:  Risk  information  sharing  with  supply  chain  partners  is  positively  related  to   (a)  customer  service  performance,  (b)  operational  effectiveness,  and  (c)  financial  performance.  H6: Product information sharing with supply chain partners is positively related to  (a)  customer  service  performance,  (b)  operational  effectiveness,  and  (c)  financial  performance.  3  Research methods  3.1  Survey questionnaire  The  survey  questionnaires  for  this  research  were  based  on  the  existing  literature.  Instruments for GSCM orientation were adopted from Qinghua and Joseph (2004) and  Narasimhan and Carter (1998). The partner’s trust questionnaire was from Mentzer et al.  (2001); the risk information sharing questionnaire was from Christine et al. (2003) and  Zsidisin  (2003).  The  product  information  sharing  questionnaire  was  from  Monczka   and  Morgan  (1998).  Supply  chain  performance  measures  take  the  green  supply  chain   into  account  based  on  works  by  Narasimhan  and  Jayaram  (1998),  Hewitt  (1999),  and  Gunasekaran et al. (2001). After translating the original questionnaire into Korean, minor  modifications were made in order to improve the acceptance and understanding of survey  respondents. All questionnaires were based on a seven-point Likert scale.  3.2  Data collection  An important issue in empirical research based on the survey questionnaire is selecting an  appropriate group of respondents for data collection. In this study, the objects of analysis  were manufacturers and distribution companies, which form the core of a supply chain  network. Two conditions were applied when selecting samples: the companies that utilise  SCM and SCM strategies and the companies that participate in the SCM specialty and  expert training courses in various associations. The data collection process began with  conducting  telephone  interviews  with  heads  of  relevant  departments  within  listed  companies and KOSDAQ-listed companies.   For three months, from June to September 2007, we contacted supply chain managers  and  explained  the  purpose  of  the  research,  and  sent  questionnaires  by  fax,  e-mail,   or regular mail to those who expressed interest in this study. Most of the contacts were  managers of purchasing or manufacturing departments.                                                                                                                          Green Supply Chain Management orientation  291 3.3  Sample characteristics  Of  the  400  questionnaires  sent  to  the target sample, 105 questionnaires were returned.   37 questionnaires were collected additionally by visiting companies in person, totalling  142 responses (35.5% of response rate). 17 responses had many missing values, which  were excluded for hypothesis testing. Table 2 presents the sample characteristics.   Most of the companies (64%, 91 companies) were manufacturing companies, and in   the  supply  chains,  most  of  the  companies  were  finished  product  assemblers  (31%,   44 companies). The questionnaire responders were mainly managers or senior personnel  (67.6%), that is, those who understand the company’s overall situation.

Similar  to  covariance-based SEM techniques (e.g., LISREL, EQS), PLS is a structural model tool  that allows for testing causal models with multiple independent, mediating and dependent  variables and with multiple indicators or measures per variable. PLS is particularly suited                                                                                                                      292    J.H. Kim et al.  to small-sample-size studies and exploratory analyses (Wold, 1985). The advantages in  using PLS are its abilities to   a  Handle multiple exogenous and endogenous constructs at the same time.  b  Address multi-collinearity among endogenous constructs.  c  Create latent construct scores directly on the basis of cross-products of multi-item  measures (Hulland, 1999; Mahama, 2006). In addition, PLS does not assume any  distributional assumptions (Chin, 1998).  4  Results for the measurement model  Confirmatory  factor  analysis  was  performed  to  evaluate  the  reliability  and  validity  of  values between measures and constructs (Hair et al., 1995). We evaluated the reliability  using  each  item’s  loading  in  each  construct  (Appendix  2).  All  of  the  measured  values  were over 0.7 on each latent variable at the significance level of 0.001 (one-tailed test).  The composite reliability values of each construct were all above 0.90, which meets the  condition to be an adequate measure according to Nunnally (1978)’s recommendation.   Average Variance Extracted (AVE) assessed the convergent validity of the research  model  (Fornell  and  Larcker,  1981).  If  the  AVE  was  more  than  0.5,  the  convergent  validity was considered to be adequate (Hair et al., 1995). All AVEs is well above 0.5,  with the least one being 0.65. The discriminant validity can be tested by contrasting the  square  root  of  the  AVE  to  the  correction  between  two  constructs.  As  Table  3  shows,   the  diagonal  elements  are  the  square  root  of  the  AVE,  and  the  off-diagonal  elements   are the correlations between the constructs. The discriminant validity was achieved since  all  the  diagonal  values  exceed  the  non-diagonal  values  (Hair  et  al.,  1995;  Fornell  and  Larcker, 1981).

The analysis utilised a bootstrapping procedure with 500 samples with replacement  in accordance with PLS analysis method (Wold, 1985).

Sobel’s test is used when testing the statistical significance of indirect relationship  between an independent construct and a dependent construct through a mediator  (Preacher and Leonardelli, 2001). The test generates t-statistics and p-values   for the indirect path.  We predicted that GSCM orientation would be positively associated with partners’ trust.  The  structural  path  coefficient  between  GSCM  orientation  and  partners’  trust  is  statistically  significant  (completely  standardised  coefficient = 0.49,  t = 5.77),  thus                                                                                                                      294    J.H. Kim et al.  providing  support  for  H1.  GSCM  orientation  also  exhibits  strong  impact  on  risk  information sharing (completely standardised coefficient = 0.54, t = 7.29) and on product  information  sharing  (completely  standardised  coefficient  = 0.44,  t = 4.9).  As  predicted,  these  results  indicate  that  the  successful  implementation  of  GSCM  requires  solid  trust  relationship and information sharing practices.   Hypothesis  3a  and  3b  predicted  a  positive  relationship  between  partner’s  trust  and  risk and product information sharing. The paths between partners’ trust and information  sharing  are  significant  and  in  the  predicted  direction.  This  provides  support  for   prior  research  findings  that  inter-organisational  trust  has  been  recognised  as  an   important enabler in building effective information sharing in supply chain management  (Spekman et al., 1998; Li and Lin, 2006).  The  path  coefficients  between  partner’s  trust  and  performances  are  statistically  significant,  supporting  H4  (H4a,  H4b,  H4c).  These  results  provide  support  for  prior  research  that  inter-organisational  trust  is  related  with  positive  economic  performance  such  as  increased  competitive  advantage,  reduced  transaction  cost,  and  augmented  satisfaction (Barney and Hansen, 1995; Zaheer and Venkatraman, 1994; Geyskens et al.,  1998).  It  also  supports  Hypotheses  H5a,  H5b,  and  H5c,  that  risk  information  sharing   has  a  positive  effect  on  customer  service  performance,  operational  effectiveness,  and  financial performance. Regarding the relationships between product information sharing  and performance, preliminary support was found for Hypotheses H6a and H6b, but its  impact on financial performance (H6c) was not supported. We found the results on the  association between the information sharing and performance to be consistent with prior  research (Huang and Gangopadhyay, 2004).  Moreover,  the  possibility  of  a  relationship  between  partners’  trust  and  the  indirect  effect  of  information  sharing  was  investigated,  and  the  indirect  effect  of  green  management  cooperation,  performance,  and  the  trust  accumulation  of  partners  was  statistically  significant.  However,  regarding  the  indirect  effect  of  information  sharing,  risk  information  sharing  has  statistically  significant  relationship  with  operational  effectiveness  and  financial  performances. Product  information  sharing  among  partners,  however,  has  significant  relationship  only  with  customer  service  performances   (see Panel B, Table 4).  5.2  Additional analysis  GSCM orientation is shown to affect the relations among customer service, operational  effectiveness,  and  financial  performance.  However,  the  marketing  literature  views  information  sharing  as  a  factor  that  helps  firms  to  accumulate  mutual  trust  among  partners.  A  post-hoc  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine  whether  or  not  information  sharing affects partner’s trust in green management context or the other way around.  The analysis shows that the path coefficients for both risk information sharing and  product  information  sharing  are  not  significantly  related  to  raising  the  partners’  trust   (see  Appendix  3,  Panel  C).  It  was  examined  whether  or  not  information  sharing  has  indirect  effects  on  SCM  performances  via  increased  partner’s  trust,  and  the  results  indicate that the indirect effects are statistically insignificant (see Appendix 3, Panel D).  Information sharing helps companies and customers to build their mutual trust. When it  comes to the green management context where top managers make strategic decisions,  however, a trust relationship has to be established first to share confidential and critical  information  with  partners.  Since  green  management  decisions  are  often  strategic  by                                                                                                                          Green Supply Chain Management orientation  295 nature, managers tend to not make core information available to partners unless they have  already accumulated a high level of trust with partners.  6  Discussions  Recent  environmental  regulations  initiated  in  many  parts  of  the  world  and  customers’  interests in green environment have directed firms to approach green supply management  from a strategic perspective. Green management is more than another stringent directive  and it demands the capability to provide manufacturers and consumers with incentives to  minimise wastes and to maximise sustainability. Firms have attempted to curtail wastes  and  pollutants  by  embedding  environment-friendly  design  process  into  product  development phase, which required substantive planning and collaboration far ahead of  product  design  stage.  This  collaborative  and  strategic  partnership  with  upstream  and  downstream  supply  chain  partners  aims  to  improve  economic  and  environmental  performance of a supply chain at the same time (Ansari and Bell, 1997).  This  study  defines  GSCM  orientation  and  verifies  whether  or  not  it  helps  firms  to  improve  financial  and  organisational  performance.  We  posited  that  partner’s  trust  and  information sharing will be mediating the impact of GSCM orientation. Six hypotheses  were developed and analysed using the data from Korean firms. The results stress two  things.  First,  green  management  improves  firm  performance.  Although  green  management reportedly has a positive influence on firm performance, it requires firms to  reshape  organisational  culture  to  be  green-  and  efficiency-friendly.  Furthermore,  implementing  GSCM  demands  firms  to  invest  their  resources  to  minimising  pollutants  and wastes and expanding managerial expansions to recyclability of the products. This  demands  neither  minor  effort  nor  little  commitment.  Such  commitment  makes  firms  reluctant to shift to green management. This research shows that green orientation results  in  positive  influence  on  increasing  firm  performance  including  customer  service,  operational effectiveness, and financial outcomes.   Second, trust and information sharing mediates the influence of GSCM orientation on  firm performance. This study shows that building trust relationship precedes information  sharing among partners. This result contradicts the notion that trust among organisations  can be accumulated when information is actively shared among partners. The additional  analysis  exhibited  that  information  sharing  does  not  help  cultivating  trust  relationship.  When it comes to green management, information sharing is a strategic matter. To ensure  green knowledge transfer, trust relationship should be built up first.   This  study  also  makes  three  contributions  to  the  extant  literature.  First,  this  study  extended  the  scope  of  green  management  study  by  defining  GSCM  orientation  and  examining  its  impact  on  firm  performance.  The  empirical  results  confirmed  that  green  management  increases  firm  performance.  Second,  this  study  showed  the  noticeable  relationships  among  partner  trust,  information  sharing  and  performances.  Cultivating  trust relationship among suppliers, distributors and customers helps firms to deliver and  spread  their  green  management  orientation  throughout  the  supply  chain.  Third,  this  research  enriched  information  sharing  practices  and  firm  performance  in  the  green  management perspective. Information sharing was classified to risk information sharing  and product information sharing, and performance was differentiated to customer service  performance,  operational  effectiveness,  and  financial  performance.  The  interaction                                                                                                                      296    J.H. Kim et al.  among these variables gives detailed understanding on the impact of green management  orientation.  7  Implications and future research  7.1  Implications for Green Supply Chain Management  From the results of this study we can draw several insights in conducing GSCM. First,  the  higher  the  green  management  orientation,  the  higher  the  three  dimensions  of   firm  performance  (i.e.,  customer  service,  operational  effectiveness,  and  financial  performance).  Despite  financial  burdens  of  conducting  GSCM,  firm  performance  increases  when  the  green  orientation  is  effectively  implemented.  Considering  that  this  empirical  study  is  based  on  South  Korean  firms,  this  finding  indicates  that  firms’  awareness on green movement is spreading to Eastern Asia and that firms are actively  reacting  to  the  green  pressure.  Second,  implementing  green  management  requires  important  information  from  partners,  effecting  information  sharing  and,  thereby,  enhancing partner trust. It is not general product information sharing but risk information  sharing  that  improves  firm  performance.  This  result  offers  managers  the  insight  that  corroborating trust relationship among partners paves the way for information sharing,  not the other way around.   7.2  Implications for managers  For managers, this research suggests that solid trust relationship need to be established  and tested among supply chain partners in the course of pursuing GSCM. Strategically  defining  the  nature  of  partner  relationships  helps  firms  to  determine  the  degree  of  collaboration  and  information  sharing.  This  insight  may  help  managers  to  clear  their  concerns  about  making  investments  into  environmental  issues  with  their  partners.   It is desirable for firms to maintain tight partnerships since environmental issues often  occur  sporadically  and  unexpectedly.  Thus,  building  a  green  supply  chain  is  about  changing supply chain culture to long-term collaboration. Indeed, it takes a long time to  build up trust in a supply chain network. By entering trust relationship with supply chain  partners,  firms  can  cultivate  organisational  culture  where  confidential  and  sensitive  information can be securely transferred and shared. In this regard, going green is about  changing a supply chain rather than changing a management tool.   7.3  Future research direction  Past researches on sustainability have studied the issues of product design and producer’s  responsibility.  This research has shed light on the process of increasing environmental  performance from trust and information sharing perspective. As firms broaden common  understanding  on  environmental  issues  and  enrich  trust  relationship  for  information  sharing,  strategic  partners  will  reflect  environmental  concerns  together  and  improve  green  performance  better.  While  environmental  management  researches  have  mainly  dealt  with  environment  policy,  regulation  and  financial  performance,  this  research  has  added another perspective to the literature from the relationship and information sharing  standpoint. Since this study is based on South Korean firms, there is a need to confirm the                                                                                                                          Green Supply Chain Management orientation  297 research framework in a broader region. It will be also interesting to see differences that  various contexts will bring to trust and information sharing. For example, in automobile  industry, a supplier could supply components to more than one manufacturer. In this case,  it  could  be  risky  to  share  confidential  green  knowledge  with  suppliers.  In  this   co-copetition situation, building a trust relationship may not be as easy and information  sharing  practices  may  take  different  forms.  Future  research  may  further  explore  these  various aspects of GSCM.   References  Ansari L.S. and Bell, J.E.
