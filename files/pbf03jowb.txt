Based on a survey of 314 privatized ?rms, the evidence offers little support for the hypotheses. Historically, results refuting theories have been launch pads for scienti?c progress. Our ?ndings, therefore, raise interesting questions about whether the underlying theory is appropriate, whether there are methodological problems, or whether there are institutional factors in Russia’s transition economy that need to be accounted for when we test agency theory in a new setting. We address these questions and discuss their implications for corporate governance theory, practice, and public policy. # 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Introduction  In the last two decades, the worldwide scale and scope of privatization have grown tremendously (Megginson & Netter, 2001). The participation of Russia and other transition economies in this move- ment has truly made it global (Svejnar, 2002). Yet, after the initial euphoria associated with political and ownership transitions is over, how to govern the privatized corporation becomes an immediate concern  * Corresponding author.

More than a decade after large-scale privatization was unleashed throughout transition economies, we now have a cumulative body of empirical knowledge from a vari- ety of countries (reviewed by Megginson & Netter, 2001; Djankov & Murrell, 2002; Estrin, 2002; Havrylyshyn & McGettigan, 2000; Wright, Buck, & Filatotchev, 2002) suggesting the following three pro- positions concerning the privatized ?rm:  1. Privatization to insiders (managers and employees), without external governance pressures, is hardly conducive for needed restructuring (e.g., Buck, Fila- totchev, & Wright, 1998; McCarthy & Puffer, 1995). 2. Outside ownership, preferably concentrated in the hands of blockholders, funds, foreigners, and/or  1090-9516/$ – see front matter # 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Peng et al. / Journal of World Business 38 (2003) 348–360  349  banks, is more likely to facilitate restructuring (e.g., Filatotchev, Hoskisson, Buck, & Wright, 1996; Filatotchev, Buck, & Zhukov, 2000).  3. When incumbent management fails to deliver desirable performance, performance is likely to improve when new managers are brought in (e.g., Barberis, Boycko, Shleifer, & Tsukanova, 1996; Frydman, Gray, Hessel, & Rapaczynski, 1999).  Underlying these three propositions is agency the- ory, which concentrates on the inherent con?ict between principals and agents (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). While private ownership is believed and shown, in general, to be superior to state ownership (Meg- ginson & Netter, 2001), a single round of privatization does not appear to solve agency problems at many ?rms in Russia and other transition economies. In this regard, privatization may be best viewed as a neces- sary but insuf?cient condition for improved perfor- mance. Overall, these three propositions highlight the signi?cant post-privatization challenges in corporate governance.  Extending the literature, we raise a critical question: Do outside owners and new managers actually improve performance in privatized ?rms? This exploratory study addresses this question by testing the second and third propositions above. Grounded in agency theory, we hypothesize the positive impact on ?rm performance made by new owners (represented by outside directors) and new managers, and present evidence from 314 privatized ?rms surveyed in Rus- sia. Our provisional results challenge the validity of these propositions, and raise interesting new questions with regard to how to govern the privatized ?rm in Russia and other transition economies.  2. Privatization: theory and practice  In theory, privatization may help minimize agency problems and lead to greater ef?ciency by improving monitoring systems and providing agents with better incentives to perform (Boycko, Shleifer, & Vishny, 1995, 1996). Upon privatization, effective restructur- ing by the new owners would presumably follow (Boycko et al., 1995: 150). However, in practice, the ?rst phase of privatization in Russia, from 1992 to 1994, only partially solved problems of state-owned  enterprises (SOEs). As shown by a voluminous litera- ture, such privatization, resulting in extensive insider control, does not necessarily lead to restructuring of former SOEs, especially the large ones (Djankov & Murrell, 2002; Estrin, 2002; Wright et al., 2002). Much of what has been reported about the resurgence of new entrepreneurship in Russia applies to smaller privatized ?rms, usually in the retail and service sectors, as well as private start-ups (Barberis et al., 1996; Havrylyshyn & McGettigan, 2000; Peng, 2001; Puffer & McCarthy, 2001). At large former SOEs, the objectives of new inside owners typically have little to do with restructuring for better performance. Rather, nonmanagerial employees (hereafter ‘‘employees’’) are mostly interested in job security. Although they now control substantial shares, employee control may not necessarily be an optimal governance structure, since the heterogeneity among employees increases the costs—and reduces reaching restructuring decisions (Earle & Estrin, 1996). More- over, employees are in ‘‘a particularly vulnerable position’’ as shareholders wishing to in?uence impor- tant decisions and threatening to ‘‘exit’’ (Buck et al., 1998: 96). Many of them rely on the ex-SOE not only for income but also a host of other bene?ts, such as housing, health care, and recreation. The tradition of ‘‘one factory, one town’’ in many parts of Russia leads to few viable, alternative employment opportunities in the local labor market. As a result, employee owner- ship poses few restraints on management’s power. Most bluntly, Boycko and colleagues (1996: 317) argue that employee control may simply be ‘‘bad for restructuring.’’  the speed—of  Having largely become ‘‘agents without princi- pals,’’ managers may be most interested in establish- ing signi?cant control of the newly privatized ?rms. This may have resulted in the self-interested entrench- ment of former SOE managers, who may be unqua- li?ed for their new roles and able to delay restructuring (Filatotchev et al., 1996, 2000). These agency pro- blems are magni?ed in the context of most privatized Russian ?rms, which generally lack other governance mechanisms such as securities markets whereby dif- ferent teams of investors and managers can contest for corporate control. Overall, despite privatization, little restructuring has occurred to improve ef?ciency and performance in many large ?rms controlled by incum- bent managers after the ?rst phase of privatization  350  M.W. Peng et al. / Journal of World Business 38 (2003) 348–360  (1992–1994) (Buck et al., 1998; Filatotchev et al., 1996, 2000). McCarthy and Puffer (1995) argue that these managers are simply ‘‘muddling through’’ responding to the crisis of the day as it occurs while not being interested in deep restructuring. Overall, instead of reaching a ‘‘triumphant completion’’ as claimed by Boycko and colleagues (1995: 8), the challenges to govern and restructure the privatized ?rm in Russia seem to be far from over (Aslund, 1995).  3. The role of outside directors and new managers  3.1. Introducing outside directors  In?uenced by an agency theory proposition that ‘‘the presence of large outside investors is conducive to ef?ciency’’ (Boycko et al., 1996: 318), the Russian government launched a second phase of the privatiza- tion program in 1994 with the objective of attracting more outside investors to restructure former SOEs. In order to make such investment more attractive to outside investors, the government set a limit of 10% share ownership for insiders, rather than the 51% cap allowed during the ?rst phase (McCarthy & Puffer, 1995: 59). Given that outside investors are typically reluctant to provide capital to restructure ?rms whose boards are completely controlled by insiders, it is common practice for outside investors to insist on certain control rights through their representatives on the board. Among these outsiders, ‘‘small’’ outsiders are individual investors, while ‘‘large’’ ones are bloc- kholders, who control more than 5% of the shares, such as strategic investors, investment funds, banks, holding companies, and foreign investors. While shares held by small outside investors have remained relatively stable, large outside investors have substantially increased their share, which may facilitate more restructuring (Barberis et al., 1996; Frydman et al., 1999).  Largely shaped by agency theory, corporate restruc- turing research places an emphasis on the monitoring role of outside board members (Dalton, Daily, Ell- strand, & Johnson, 1998). Outside directors are expected to be more closely aligned with outside investors’ interests, to monitor top management deci- sions more effectively, and thus, to lead the ?rm to better performance. Research in the West suggests that  following poor performance, ?rms typically add out- siders to their boards (Hermalin & Weisbach, 1988). Similarly, in Russia, it is precisely poor ?rm perfor- mance that has led to increased outside investment, and hence, the introduction of outside board members, who may facilitate more restructuring (Filatotchev et al., 2000). Thus:  Hypothesis 1: In privatized Russian ?rms, the pre- sence of outside board members is positively asso- ciated with ?rm performance.  3.2. Introducing new managers  Privatized Russian ?rms not only need new outside board members, but also new managers capable of restructuring and leading ?rm growth (Puffer, 1992, 1994; Peng & Heath, 1996). Jensen (1987: 104) argues that ‘‘[incumbent] managers often have trouble aban- doning strategies they have spent years devising and implementing, even when these strategies no longer contribute to the organization’s survival. It is easier for new top-level managers with no ties to current employees or communities to make changes.’’ In privatized Russian ?rms, a number of studies docu- ment the entrenchment of existing managers, who obtained most of their experience during the socialist era (Blasi, Kroumova, & Kruse, 1997; Filatotchev et al., 1996, 2000; McCarthy & Puffer, 1995; Earle & Estrin, 1996). Such managerial control, ‘‘while far superior to state ownership, . . . gives managers too much control relative to what is needed to speed up ef?cient restructuring’’ (Shleifer & Vasiliev, 1996: 77). Although some incumbent managers may be interested in restructuring, they typically lack the necessary skills and capabilities (Puffer, 1994).  As a result, there is an urgent need to replace the old guards with a new generation of managers. Approxi- mately 10% of the Russian CEOs1 were removed at the ?rst shareholder meeting by coalitions of outside investors and employees (Shleifer & Vasiliev, 1996: 74). Overall, between 1992 and 1996, one-third of the privatized Russian ?rms replaced their CEOs (Blasi et al., 1997: 203). While such a pace of managerial  1 The Russian term for CEOs is ‘‘general directors.’’ In this article, we use the term ‘‘CEOs’’ to avoid confusion with the directors on the board.  M.W. Peng et al. / Journal of World Business 38 (2003) 348–360  351  turnover is very impressive, Russian ?rms may need even faster turnover of old-guard managers (Shleifer & Vasiliev, 1996).  Since the managerial labor market is underdeve- loped in Russia, most new managers are likely to be insiders (Earle & Estrin, 1996). Blasi and colleagues (1997: 203) ?nd that only less than 20% of the new CEOs came from outside. Although new, inside man- agers may continue to pose agency problems asso- ciated with insider control discussed earlier, these new managers may still be better than old ones. This is because new managers are typically younger, more adaptive, and less in?uenced by the old way of SOE management. More importantly, some of them may have acquired skills that would enable them to func- tion better in a more competitive, market-driven econ- omy (Puffer, 1992, 1994; Peng, 2000, 2003). As a result, they may be more likely to undertake aggres- sive restructuring aimed at performance improvement. In this regard, managers’ age may be a good measure to assess the in?uence of the old system and exposure to the new environment (Hambrick & Mason, 1984). Blasi and colleagues (1997: 203) report a steady decline of Russian CEOs’ age over the years. Speci?cally, the average age of CEOs in of?ce before 1992 was 52 years old, and the average age of those in of?ce since 1992 declined to 47. Among the latter group, the average age of those named CEOs in 1995 went down to 45. In addition to the CEO, the average age of other top managers in privatized Russian ?rms also experienced a decline (Blasi et al., 1997). There- fore, it is reasonable to expect that even in the case of continued insider control, the presence of new man- agers may still lead to relatively more restructuring and better performance. Stated formally:  Hypothesis 2: In privatized Russian ?rms, the pre- sence of new top managers (both insiders and out- siders) is positively associated with ?rm performance.  4. Methodology  4.1. Research design  The study was carried out in late 1995 and early 1996, approximately 3 years after the beginning of the ?rst phase of privatization in Russia. Building on  previous surveys in Russia published elsewhere (Buck et al., 1998; Filatotchev et al., 1996, 2000), a ques- tionnaire was ?rst constructed in English, and was then translated into Russian by one of the authors who is a native speaker of Russian and by an of?cial in the Center for Economic Reform in the Russian govern- ment. The Russian version was then back translated into English to ensure accuracy.  The questionnaire was ?rst piloted in face-to-face interviews with two respondents at each of ten priva- tized ?rms in Moscow. Given the sensitive nature of our inquiry, a mail survey would probably have led to a low response rate. Therefore, we relied on trained interviewers to survey managers on site. The selection of this method was also driven by our interest to gather more insightful data from face-to-face interviews. One senior manager, usually the CEO, was interviewed. After covering survey items, respondents were invited to provide additional, open-ended information. The pilot study revealed, with the falling novelty value of Western surveys, the general infeasibility of multiple respondents from a single ?rm in Russia. The method of single-respondent surveys thus became unavoidable and is consistent with almost all other published surveys conducted in Russia (e.g., McCarthy & Puffer, 1995; Barberis et al., 1996; Earle & Estrin, 1996; Filatotchev et al., 1996, 2000; Blasi et al., 1997; Buck et al., 1998).  Besides dif?culties in obtaining multiple responses from a single ?rm, other problems require unique methodological solutions in Russia due to the break- down of the Soviet Union. While the State Commis- sion for Statistics (Goskomstat) was able to supply information on SOEs and their characteristics in the USSR before 1991, privatization in Russia and most of the former Soviet republics tended to be decentralized and regional in character, with no national body collecting detailed statistics. This effectively ruled out quota and strati?ed sampling and left only reliance on the central limit theorem: If samples were ran- domly drawn, then as their sizes increased, sample means tended to be normally distributed around the population mean. Such a sampling methodology cor- responded broadly with the methodology used by the World Bank (Blasi et al., 1997) as well as a host of other surveys. In our case, six independent groups of Russia-based professional surveyors were instructed to collect large samples of manufacturing ?rms of  352  M.W.

The result was a sample of 314 relatively large ?rms (Table 1) in six major industrial regions (Chelyabinsk, Ekaterinburg, Moscow, Nizhny Nov- gorod, Perm, and St. Petersburg). Even intended ran- dom surveys in Russian could result in convenience samples because of surveyors’ local contacts. How- ever, one could expect differing patterns of conveni- ence in six different regions, thus leading to ‘‘quasi- random’’ samples.  On average, sampled ?rms had been privatized 31 months earlier, with a standard deviation of 9 months. Almost a third of them were in machinery, 20% in light manufacturing, and the remainder in a variety of manufacturing industries. The average employment size of our sampled ?rms was 1,632, which was similar to the average size of ?rms reported in other major surveys (e.g., 1,983 in Blasi & Shleifer, 1996 and 1,802 in Blasi et al., 1997).  4.2. Measures  4.2.1. Dependent variables  Previous research suggests that, in the absence of archival data, self-reported performance measures are  acceptable and often equally reliable when care is taken to obtain data from reliable informants (Dess & Robinson, 1984). In this case, most respondents were CEOs, who were in the best position to know their ?rms’ performance.  While in general performance measures can be accounting- or market-based, the underdeveloped ?nancial markets in Russia rendered accounting-based measures to be our only choice. We focused on pre-tax pro?ts and return on investment (ROI) as two key performance measures. These were widely used by managers in making capital decisions. Unfortunately, the Russian economy experienced annual average consumer price hyperin?ation of 1,526% in 1992. During the survey years of 1995 and 1996 it was still at levels of 198 and 48%, respectively (EBRD, 1997: 233). With in?ation at such high levels, obtaining an accurate measure of ?rm performance based on ‘‘con- stant price’’ calculations was almost impossible. Therefore, we used a seven-point Likert scale to measure relative changes in these two measures. Speci?cally, respondents were requested to indicate whether their ?rms’ real pre-tax pro?ts and return on investment, during the past 12 months (a) decreased more than 20%, (b) 10–20%, (c) less than 10%, (d) had no change, or (e) increased less than 10%, (f) 10–20%, or (g) more than 20% (see Appendix A).  Besides hyperin?ation, another problem with man- agers’ perceptions of ?nancial performance was that this measure might be in?uenced by the systematic under-reporting of pro?ts in the face of exorbitant corporate tax rates (Maddy & Ickes, 1998).2 The use of Likert scale rather than ruble measures of pro?t and returns reduced but did not eliminate this problem (we will refer to this problem again in the discussion of ?ndings).  4.2.2. Independent variables  The board structure of privatized Russian ?rms is complex. While the majority of ?rms seem to have a single board comprising executives and outside direc- tors in an approximation to the Anglo-American  2 For example, one enterprise reported that ‘‘it had to pay a basic profit tax of 38%. This is in addition to a municipal tax of 1%, 3% for garbage collection, 2% in property tax, and 10% in ecological tax amounting to a total of 54% of its profits. In other cases, the basic profit tax could be much higher’’ (Aslund, 1995: 204).  M.W. Peng et al. / Journal of World Business 38 (2003) 348–360  353  model, a minority have adopted German-style, two- tier boards, where the shareholders appoint a super- visory board, which in turn appoints managers to an otherwise separate executive board. In practice, how- ever, these distinctions are often blurred. Russian supervisory boards can be manned entirely by inside managers and employees without any outsiders, just as executive boards can include outside directors and a few insiders. Under it was decided to observe the presence of outside directors on the single board and/or supervisory or executive boards, whenever appropriate. In this regard, our method of relying on on-site interviewers was far superior to other methods such as a mail survey, since interviewers could clarify with the respondents about the actual board structure and then guide them through the answers.  these circumstances,  At the time of our survey, 84 of the sampled ?rms were classi?ed as ‘‘closed joint stock companies,’’ which were not legally able to have outside directors. Therefore, only 230 respondents provided information on outside directors on the board. Respondents were asked to indicate whether a particular category of outside investor was represented on the board(s). Among the 230 ?rms whose respondents provided information, 33% had outsiders on a supervisory board, and 27% reported outsiders on an executive board.  With respect to managerial turnover, we asked (a) whether the CEO had been replaced, and (b) whether other top managers had been replaced. Since the construct of ‘‘top managers’’ may entail a relatively large number of people, we limited the measure to those executive directors who were on either a single- tier board or on the lower, executive board in a two-tier board structure. The rationale was that if a manager sat  Table 2 Means, standard deviations, and correlations  on the board as an inside director, he or she would naturally be a top manager. Among sampled ?rms, 24% had new CEOs, and 34% had some new executive directors on the board.  4.2.3. Control variables  Firm size has long been recognized in corporate governance research (Dalton et al., 1998). The size effect may be especially relevant in Russia, in light of anecdotal evidence suggesting that larger privatized ?rms are more entrenched while smaller ones are more entrepreneurial (McCarthy & Puffer, 1995; Barberis et al., 1996). Firm size can be measured by assets or employment. Given Russia’s hyperin?ationary econ- omy, measuring ?rm size according to their asset values would introduce too much noise. Despite the wide ?uctuation of asset values, the employment level at most large Russian ?rms has been relatively stable (Aukutsionek, 1997). Therefore, we used the ?rms’ employment level as a measure for ?rm size, which on average had 1,632 employees and a standard deviation of 2,919.  In terms of hypothesis testing, we deployed the ordered probit regression analysis using LIMDEP statistical package since our dependent variables are not continuous, and the analysis provides a scaled subjective evaluation of the (unobserved) continuos variables (Greene, 1993).  5.
