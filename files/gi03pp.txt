PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  2003,56,383404  THE IMPACT OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT  AND WORK CLIMATE ON ORGANIZATIONAL  PERFORMANCE  GARRY A. GELADE  International Survey Research  MARK IVERY  Lloyds TSB Group Employee Research  This paper examines relationships between human resource manage-  ment  (HRM),  work  climate,  and organizational performance  in the  branch network of a retail bank.  It extends previous research on group-  level climate-performance  and HRM-performance relationships and  examines how climate and HRM function as joint antecedents of busi-  ness  unit  performance.  Significant correlations  are found  between  work climate,  human resource practices,  and business performance.  The results show that  the correlations  between  climate  and perfor-  mance cannot be explained by their common dependence on HRM fac-  tors, and that the data are consistent with a mediation model in which  the effects of  HRM practices  on business performance  are partially  mediated by work climate.  Few organizations can evaluate their performance accurately by av-  eraging the performance of  their employees.  In most cases, the per-  formance of an organization is determined by the productivity and effi-  ciency of  such higher-level organizational entities as departments, retail  outlets, plants, or teams.  In the language of  operations research, these  productive entities are called “decision-making units” (DMUs). DMUs  can be compared to each other when they consume the same type of  resources and produce the same type of  outputs.  Examples of  DMUs  within an organization are branches of a bank, stores in a retail chain, or  assembly lines in a factory. At a higher level, whole organizations in the  same industry can also be treated as DMUs.  Despite the practical importance of  DMU  performance for man-  aging organizations, research on the psychology of  work effectiveness  has historically been focused on performance outcomes at the individ-  ual employee, rather than at the DMU, level.

COPYRIGHT  (B ZW3 PEFSONNELPSYCHOMGY,  INC  383  384  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  Patton  (2001) were  able to locate  1,008 individual-level studies.  Al-  though there can be little doubt that high levels of individual effective-  ness are an essential component of  superior DMU performance,  it is  nevertheless clear that  a description limited to the individual level is  incomplete.  Many types of  organizational behaviour (e.g., social loaf-  ing; Shepperd, 1993) and many indicators of organizational performance  (e.g.,  customer satisfaction) exist only at the group level and have no ob-  vious equivalent at the individual level.  Nor can the antecedents of effective group-level performance be in-  ferred solely from individual-level antecedents.  Consider, for example,  a sales outlet whose customers and whose employees have either Spanish  or English as their native language. Under a bonus scheme that rewards  individual sales performance, an English-speaking salesperson may be  tempted to close a sale with a Spanish-speaking customer to increase  their bonus, instead of passing the customer to a Spanish-speaking col-  league who might have a better chance of  making the sale.  In this ex-  ample, an incentive scheme that may be highly effective for individual  salespeople working on their own serves to depress performance at the  DMU level.  It seems reasonable to suppose that DMU performance is a function  both of individual employee performance and the higher-level context in  which the jobs are done. However, relatively little is known about DMU  performance and its antecedents, and both Ostroff (1992, p. 969),  and  Ryan, Schmit, and Johnson (1996, p. 878) have argued for more research  at this level of analysis. To date, two broad strands of empirical research  have emerged.  First, a number of researchers have found links between psycholog-  ical measures of the work environment (climate, perceptions, attitudes,  satisfaction) and performance at the DMU level.  For example, Ostroff  (1992) demonstrated that school-average levels of  teacher satisfaction,  commitment, adjustment, and stress were correlated with school effec-  tiveness as measured by student achievement, attendance, and drop-out  rates.  Likewise, West, Smith, Feng, and Lawthom (1998) found links  between staff perceptions of climate and the research excellence of uni-  versity departments. Similar relationships have also been found in com-  mercial organizations. For instance, at the level of the whole organiza-  tion, Kotter and Heskett (1992) showed that the perceived strength of  a company’s culture is positively correlated with its long-term economic  performance as measured by net income growth, return on investment,  and increase in stock price over a 10-year period.  One aspect of DMU performance that has attracted particular atten-  tion from organizational researchers is customer satisfaction.  Schnei-  der, for instance, has demonstrated that employees’ perceptions of cli-  GELADE AND IVERY  385  mate correlate with customers’ ratings of  satisfaction in bank branches  (e.g., Schneider & Bowen, 1985; Schneider, Parkington, & Buxton, 1980,  Schneider, White, & Paul, 1998). Other authors reporting similar find-  ings include Johnson (1996), Koys (2001), Rucci, Kirn, and Quinn (1998),  Ryan, Schmit, and Johnson (1996), and Schmit and Allscheid (1995).  Other indicators of  DMU performance have also been linked to em-  ployee attitudes and climate perceptions.  For example, reduced  staff  turnover and superior financial performance are associated with positive  attitudes (Ryan, Schmit, & Johnson, 1996), and sales performance with  service climate (Borucki & Burke, 1999). Finally, Harter, Schmidt, and  Hayes (2002) have shown weak, but meta-analytically generalizable, cor-  relations at the DMU level between customer satisfaction, productivity,  profit, staff turnover and accidents, and a composite index of  employee  satisfaction and engagement.  This body of  research is not without its weaknesses; some studies  have used small numbers of  DMUs (e.g., Koys, 2001, n  = 28; Schnei-  der & Bowen,  1985, n  = 28;  Schneider, Parkington, & Buxton,  1980,  n = 23), and some of the most frequently cited (e.g., Kotter & Heskett,  1992; Rucci, Kirn, & Quinn, 1998; Wiley, 1996) have not appeared in  peer-reviewed journals.  Nevertheless, and despite some negative find-  ings (e.g., Schneider & Snyder, 1975), the evidence to date suggests a rea-  sonably consistent relationship between DMU performance and DMU  aggregate measures of both employee satisfaction and work climate.  In this paper, we shall focus on work climate rather than satisfac-  tion. Although these two constructs are conceptually distinct (James &  James, 1989; Kopelman, Brief, & Guzzo, 1990), from a measurement  perspective they do exhibit considerable overlap; for example, at the in-  dividual level, James and James (1989) report  an average correlation  of .89 between overall job satisfaction and psychological climate.  Over-  all, therefore, prior research points both  directly and indirectly to the  conclusion that DMUs with favorable work climates outperform those  with unfavorable climates.  A second strand of research has investigated HRM (human resource  management) factors as potential antecedents of  DMU performance.  For instance, Arthur (1994) found that steel mills operating commitment-  centered HRM systems have higher productivity, lower scrap rates, and  lower employee turnover than  those with control-centered  HRM sys-  tems.  Furthermore, Huselid (1995) found that HRM practices such as  employee recruitment and selection procedures, compensation and per-  formance management systems, employee involvement, and employee  training have a significant impact on employee turnover and productiv-  ity, and on short and long term corporate financial performance.  Sim-  ilarly, Huselid, Jackson, & Schuler (1997) showed that HRM effective-  386  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  ness is associated with increased financial performance  as indexed by  productivity, cash flow, and market value.  Youndt,  Snell, Dean, and  Lepak (1996) showed that, particularly in the context of  a quality man-  ufacturing strategy, employee productivity is higher in manufacturing  plants where the HRM system is focused on enhancing human capital  and, similarly, Patterson and West (1998) found significant influences  of job design and employee skill development on the productivity and  profitability of  small and medium sized U.K. manufacturing companies.  In summary, the empirical evidence to date points to two distinct  correlates of  enhanced DMU performance-favorable  work climates  and progressive HRM policies and practices.  Given that DMU perfor-  mance is associated both with work climate and HRM factors, we may  envisage two conceptual models.  On the one hand, progressive HRM  practices may  enhance both climate perceptions  and business perfor-  mance. This raises the possibility that the observed associations between  climate and performance are spurious (dependent on a common third  factor) and that climate and performance are not causally connected.  A second possibility, proposed by Kopelman, Brief, and Guzzo (1990),  Huselid (1995), Delaney and Huselid (1996), and Ostroff and Bowen  (2000) among others, is that climate is a mediating link between HRM  and performance.  The conjecture here is that progressive HRM prac-  tices foster a positive work climate, which increases employee well being  and motivation, and this, in turn, leads to enhanced DMU performance.  A conceptual model of this process has been described by Kopelman,  Brief, and Guzzo (1990). In their model of organizational functioning,  these authors argue that HRM practices designed to improve productiv-  ity also influence one or more dimensions of work climate, conceived of  here as “meaningful interpretations of  a work environment by the peo-  ple in it” (p. 290). For example, changes in pay and promotion policies  might be expected to alter employee perceptions of reward orientation  and possibly of equity and fairness; similarly, the introduction of  train-  ing programs, a practice that often improves productivity, is likely also  to have a positive influence on employee perceptions of  task support.  Work climate, in turn, is posited to influence the cognitive and affective  states of employees in the workplace, in particular, work motivation and  job satisfaction; and these psychological states serve to shape individual  behaviours such as job performance and citizenship, which in turn have  an effect on organizational productivity and performance. Patterson and  West (1998) have presented some empirical evidence for such a medi-  ating role of climate, although the sample size for their mediation tests  was rather small (n = 37).  As Becker and  Gerhart  (1996, p.  793) point  out, the influence of  HRM  on DMU  performance  cannot  be  explained without  identifi-  GELADE AND IVERY  387  cation of suitable intervening variables, and understanding the joint and  interacting roles of HRM and climate is therefore a vital element in fur-  thering our understanding of performance at the DMU level of analysis.  Our purpose in this paper is thus to clarify the processes by which HRM  and climate relate to each other and to DMU performance, and in this  way to evaluate the climate-performance relationship within a broader  context of DMU functioning than has hitherto been the case.  The DMUs we shall describe are branch clusters of  a U.K.  retail  bank, and the performance measures are staff retention, clerical accu-  racy, customer satisfaction, and sales performance, all measured at the  DMU level.  As subunits of  a single organization, these DMUs follow a central  HRM strategy and have many HRM procedures in common. However,  there is considerable management discretion at the local level, leading,  for example, to different systems for managing the workload, and differ-  ent emphases on staff development.  It is the outcomes of these opera-  tional decisions that we use as indicators of HRM practice in the DMUs.  The HRM indicators we shall consider are staffing level (as a propor-  tion of  the overall workload), working hours (represented by  the pro-  portion of overtime), and professional development (represented by the  percentage of staff with customer service qualifications). These opera-  tionally defined indicators differ from the indicators of HRM that have  been used in many previous studies of HRM and performance.  Wright et  al. (2001) pointed out that most such studies have used single-respondent  survey measures of strategic HRM practice, and demonstrated that such  measures contain large amounts of  measurement error.  They further  suggested that studies be conducted “at different levels of analysis where  practices are more uniform and performance measures less distal from  the effects of practices.” (p. 899) This study conforms with that recom-  mendation by examining DMUs that operate within the common strate-  gic HRM framework of  a single organization and by using HRM mea-  sures that reflect local decision making within that framework.  The study addresses two questions.  First, can the observed corre-  lations between climate and DMU performance be explained by their  common dependence on HRM decisions?  Second, does climate medi-  ate the relationship between HRM decisions and DMU performance?  Method  DMU Definition  The DMU for this study was the branch director group (BDG). The  BDG is a geographically defined cluster of  bank branches, comprising  388  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  between 3 and 24 branches ( M  = 10.7) and employing between 95 and  305 staff ( M  = 178). A branch director, responsible for the local con-  textualization and implementation of bank policy, manages each BDG,  and business performance is monitored centrally against annually de-  fined targets.  The BDG is focused primarily on sales and service, with  most transaction processing being carried out elsewhere in specialized  centers. The BDG was chosen as the DMU rather than the branch partly  because more performance data were available at this level, but primar-  ily because it is effectively a self-contained business, with profitability  and operational management responsibilities vested in the branch di-  rector. There were 137 BDGs in the sample.  BDG HRM and Performance Measures  The HRM and performance measures described below were pro-  vided by the bank. They were all drawn from the bank’s existing perfor-  mance management systems rather than being gathered for the purpose  of this investigation.  Stajging level. Staffing level (actual staff level minus theoretical staff  establishment), as a percentage of  the theoretical  staff establishment,  averaged over the period May 2000 to March 2001. The theoretical staff  establishment is derived from measures of  work throughput in which  standard effort is associated with standard tasks such as opening a new  account.  The maintenance of  appropriate staffing levels is a core re-  sponsibility of the branch director.  Overtime. The percentage of overtime hours worked per month, av-  eraged over the period  May 2000 to March 2001.  (For the bivariate  and multivariate analyses reported here, a square-root transformation  of  overtime was used to improve normality.)  Overtime is viewed by the  bank as a controllable cost and is a key part of the branch director’s re-  sponsibilities. Local management is encouraged to minimize overtime.  Professional development. The percentage of BDG staff certified as  competent in the provision of  customer service.  For customer-facing  staff, participation in the certification scheme is voluntary and certifi-  cation is obtained through experiential training, which is accredited by  an external provider of  vocational qualifications.  Assessors from the  awarding body examine record books kept by  the candidates, observe  their interactions with customers, and award certification to candidates  judged to be fully competent.  The bank funds this training scheme and  provides the infrastructure, but the development effort is supplied by the  candidates.  Sales against target. Overall personal sector sales in the period Jan-  uary 2001 to April 2001 as a percentage of the target value of sales for  GELADE AND IVERY  389  that period. Each BDG has a series of targets for sales to personal cus-  tomers. These are weighted and aggregated to an overall personal sector  target that takes into account the expected mix of business in the local  area, thus providing a target that is theoretically immune to local market  variations and unique to each BDG. Sales against target is regarded by  senior management and BDG management as the single most important  indicator of success.  Customer satisfaction.  Customer satisfaction as measured by fully  structured telephone survey. The data were gathered during a 3-month  window from January 2001 to March 2001.  In the period in question,  approximately 300 customers were interviewed per BDG. The interview  consisted of  a series of  questions with Likert scale response options.  Responses from customers who have visited their BDG branch in the  past month are given a higher weighting in constructing the customer  satisfaction score.  Staff  retention.  The total number of  staff remaining in post in the  period April 2000 to March 2001 as a percentage of the average number  of  staff in post in the period.  Clerical accuracy. The percentage of a particular information form,  judged by top management to be important, completed correctly in the  period January 2001 to March 2001.  An index formed from the three HRM measures (staffing level, over-  time, and professional development) had a low internal consistency and  so these measures were not combined. However, a composite measure  of  overall BDG performance computed by  averaging the standardized  scores for sales against target, customer satisfaction, staff retention, and  clerical accuracy had a reasonably satisfactory level of reliability (Cron-  bach alpha .64) and this measure was used as an index of overall BDG  performance.  Employee Survey  Measures of  BDG climate were derived from responses to an em-  ployee opinion survey administered in three waves (February 2000, Oc-  tober 2000, and February 2001), each covering approximately one-third  of  the bank and producing returns from respectively 9,215; 7,582; and  8,254 employees, at an overall response rate of 49%. The survey was de-  signed by a commercial survey company to monitor employee opinion,  not for the purposes of this study. Slightly different questionnaires were  used in each wave, but there were 155 items common to all three waves,  most of which had a 5-point Likert response scale.  After eliminating questionnaires from non-BDG staff and those with  more than 20% of  questions unanswered, there were 14,390 employee  390  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  questionnaires  available for  analysis.  The number of  questionnaires  per BDG ranged between 30 and 284 ( M  = 107).  The majority of  re-  spondents (72.6%) were women; 75.1 % of the respondents were clerical  or supervisory staff, 12.5% were managers or assistant managers, 1.3%  were senior managers or above, and the remainder were in other grades  or did not indicate their grade.  Construction of  Climate Scales  Scale construction was conducted  at the individual employee level  and was based on factor analysis of  all retained questionnaires.  After  eliminating items that had low response rates or an inappropriate re-  sponse scale, there were 149 items suitable for factor analysis. Item re-  sponses were scored one to five, higher numbers being associated with  more favorable responses.  One problem we encountered was that the questionnaire contained  a substantial number of consecutive pairs (and some triplets) of similar  items with the same stem.  Items in such pairs and triplets were some-  times highly correlated, suggesting a method effect that would produce  spurious (i.e., method) factors. We therefore conducted a principal com-  ponents analysis on the 149 items using the technique of radial parceling  (Barrett & Kline, 1981; Cattell & Burdsall, 1975) that we have previously  found useful in extracting interpretable factors from this type of  ques-  tionnaire.  In this procedure, the items are first subjected to a parceling  algorithm that identifies pairs of  items with similar loading patterns in  the unrotated component matrix, similarity being assessed by the con-  gruence coefficient. The algorithm proceeds by searching for the pair of  loading patterns with the highest congruence and eliminating this pair  from subsequent searches. Searching stops when there are no more pairs  of items with a congruence coefficient above a specified minimum. The  algorithm then attempts to assign each of the remaining unpaired items  to one of the previously constructed item pairs to form an item triplet.  Triplets are accepted if  the average congruence between pairs of items  in the triplet exceeds the specified minimum. The minimum congruence  coefficient was set at .75, and in this way, 61 two-item parcels and nine  three-item parcels were created, all parcels having a congruence coeffi-  cient of .78 or higher. Next, parcel scores for each case were computed  by  averaging the item scores within each parcel and the parcels were  subjected to principal components analysis.  This procedure recovered  10 components, explaining 65.8% of  the variance of  the parcel corre-  lation matrix.  All the components were readily interpretable following  Oblimin rotation.  GELADE AND IVERY  391  Parcels were assigned to each scale in accordance with the rotated  component structure, but ignoring parcels with low loadings (i.e., not  belonging to any specific component) or complex loadings (i.e.,  belong-  ing to more than one component.)  Seven components were identified  as climate indicators. Scale lengths, scale reliabilities, and sample items  are presented in Table 1.  The climate dimensions recovered here may be located within the  conceptual spaces of  organizational climate described by  James  and  James (1989),  and by  Kopelman,  Brief,  and  Guzzo  (1990).  Coach-  ing, Leadership, and Local Management cover between them much of  the space delineated by James and James’s second-order climate factor  Leader Support and Facilitation.  Goal Clarity would appear to corre-  spond to James and James’ first-order factor role Ambiguity (reversed),  and to be part of Kopelman et al.3 goal emphasis. Rewards clearly falls  within Kopelman et al.’s Reward Orientation, and Job Challenge within  James and James’ second-order factor Job Challenge and Autonomy;  Job Enablers can be clearly located within Kopelman et al.’s Task Sup-  port. However, no dimensions were recovered directly corresponding to  James and James’ Work Group Cooperation, Warmth, and Friendliness,  or to Kopelman et al.’s Means Emphasis or Socioemotional Support.  The average correlation between the scales was .56  and, in addition,  principal components analysis of the seven scale scores recovered a sin-  gle component explaining 64% of the variance of the scale score correla-  tion matrix. This suggests the existence of a higher-order climate factor  underlying employee perceptions. This factor appeared to be conceptu-  ally equivalent to the general psychological climate factor (PCg) identi-  fied by James and James (1989). According to these authors, PCg rep-  resents all emotionally relevant work-related cognitions and reflects the  degree to which the work environment is perceived as personally bene-  ficial or detrimental to one’s well being; evidence for such a hierarchical  factor has also been reported by Parker (1999).  Accordingly we aver-  aged the scores on the seven first-order scales to create a summary scale  that we labeled General Climate (see Table 1).  Aggregation  Although organizational climate is measured through individual per-  ceptions, the appropriate unit of analysis is the organization or organi-  zational subunit.  To  obtain climate scores at the appropriate level of  analysis, it is thus necessary to aggregate individual employee scores to  the group level, and it has been suggested that aggregation is justifiable  only if there is a minimum degree of consensus among the respondents  in the group (James, 1982; Joyce & Slocum, 1984).    3           F 0 z z E   2   4   2     0 0 r s 9       . o d   I     . m a e t   y m f  o   s e v i t c e j b o   y t i l a u q   e h t   t u o b a   d e m r o f n  i y l t n e i c i f f u s   m a   I k r o w   e h t   r o f   l l e w   e m   d e r a p e r p   s a h   d e v i e c e r   e v a  h I   g n i n i a r t   e h T   . s e e y o l p m e f  o   g n i e b   l l e w   e h t   n i   d e t s e r e t n i   s i   t n e m e g a n a m   p o T   . k r o w m a e t   g n i d l i u b f  o   b o j   d o o g   a   s e o d   r e g a n a m   y M   . y l r i a f   d i a p   m a   I   k n i h t   I   , m a e t   y m   n i   e l p o e p   r e h t o   h t i w   d e r a p m o C   . e c n a m r o f r e p   y m   n o   . * s e i t i l i b a   y m   e s u   o t   y t i n u t r o p p o   e l t t i l   s r e f f o   b o j   y M   k c a b d e e f   r a l u g e r   e m   s e v i g   r e g a n a m   y M   . e l b a c i l p p a   t o N     1 9 .   4 9 . 2 9 .   0 9 .   0   5 9 9 . .   .90'  6 8 .   6       3 1 4 1 4 1     1 1 1 1   5   I   t n e m e g a n a m   l a c o L   p i h s r e d a e L   y t i r a l c   l a o G   s r e l b a n e   b o J   e t a m   e g n e l l a h c   b o J   g n i h c a o C i l c   l a r e n e G   s d r a w e R   . s m e t i f  o   r e b m u n   , s e l a c s   r e h t o   l l a   r o  f ; s e r o c s   e l a c s   f o   r e b m u n   , e t a m i l c   l a r e n e g   r o F   . s e r o c s   e l a c s b u s   n e v e s   e h t   n o d e s a B     . d e r o c s   e s r e v e R   1   E L B A T     s m e t I   e l p m a S d n  a s e i t i l i b a i l e R   e l a c S   m e t i   e l p m a S   h c a b n o r   a h p l a C   e l a c S   " h t g n e l   e l a c S GELADE AND IVERY  393  There are several reasons to expect that a degree of consensus might  exist  at the BDG level.  First, employees within a BDG interact with  each other. Staff are often directed, either routinely or exceptionally, to  work at other branches within their BDG to cope with temporary peaks  in workload or sickness.  Furthermore, staff with a common role also  attend regular meetings at BDG level, and key events for employees,  such as the annual pay awards and major social events, are coordinated  at BDG level. It has long been known in the social sciences that people  can and do exert a strong influence on each other’s beliefs, attitudes,  and behaviors (e.g., Allport,  1935; Turner, 1991), and as Sechrist and  Stangor (2001) demonstrated, learning whether one’s beliefs are or are  not shared with others influences attitudes, behaviour, and the strength  of  the attitude-behaviour  relationship.  Interactions  among staff thus  provide a basis for the evolution of commonly held job-related opinions  and beliefs among employees within a BDG.  Secondly, differences in BDG local strategies, such as the priority  accorded to training, the implementation of workload-sharing systems,  and the relative emphasis placed on the sales and service functions, pro-  vide opportunities for distinct BDG characteristics to evolve, and sug-  gest that aggregated BDG climate scores would reflect genuine group  differences.  Glick (1985) has argued that the best statistic for justifying aggrega-  tion is ICC2, the reliability of the mean group score. ICC2 was .88, well  above the accepted minimum criterion of  .7.  In addition, ICC1, the in-  dividual level intraclass correlation, was .07, and a maximum-likelihood  variance components analysis showed that 7.4% of  the variance in cli-  mate scores was attributable to the BDG. Overall, therefore, aggrega-  tion to the BDG level seems justified on both substantive and statistical  grounds and, accordingly, BDG climate scores were calculated by aver-  aging individual climate scores within each BDG.  Results  Univariate Statistics and Bivariate Correlations  Table 2 shows univariate statistics and bivariate correlations between  the study variables.  The correlations reported in Table 2 are largely in accordance with  expectations and with previous research.  First, General Climate cor-  relates  positively with sales against target,  staff retention, clerical ac-  curacy, customer satisfaction, and overall performance.

High levels of  overtime are associated with lower levels  of sales against target, clerical accuracy, staff retention, and overall per-  formance; increased staffing levels are associated with elevated scores  on all performance outcomes except sales against target; and increased  levels of professional development are associated with enhanced perfor-  mance on all business outcomes. In addition, all three HRM indicators  are significantly correlated with General Climate, a finding consistent  with the view that positive HR practices contribute to employees’ sense  of  well being.  Finally, we note that there  are significant correlations  between the business outcomes, and in particular, correlations between  customer satisfaction and sales have also been reported by Rucci, Kirn,  and Quinn (1998), for example.  HRM-Climate-Pe$omance  Relationships  To  test  the possibility that  the observed relationships between cli-  mate and performance are due to the common influence of  HRM de-  cisions, we computed partial correlations between general climate and  each of the performance outcomes while controlling simultaneously for  the three HRM variables: staffing level, overtime, and professional de-  velopment. The partial correlations (df  = 121) were, respectively: sales  against target, T  = .30, p < .001; clerical accuracy, T  = .lo, ns; staff re-  tention, T  = .24, p  < .01; overall performance, T  = .30, p = .001; and  customer satisfaction, T  = .12, ns. Comparing these correlations with  the corresponding zero-order correlations in Table 2, we see that of the  five significant climate-performance correlations in Table 2, three (sales  against target, staff retention, and overall performance) remain signif-  icant, and only the correlations for clerical accuracy and customer sat-  isfaction become nonsignificant when the HRM variables are partialled  out.  This demonstrates that the climate-performance  correlations ob-  served here cannot be explained by a common correlation with the HRM  variables.  Next, we examined the role of  climate as a mediator between each  of  the three HRM variables and the BDG performance outcomes.  In  the procedure advocated by Baron and Kenny (1986), mediation effects  are determined by analysis of separate regression equations. However, a  convenient alternative is to estimate a path model as shown in Figure 1,  where the box labelled HRM represents an HRM decision variable and  the box labelled performance outcome represents a BDG performance  indicator.  In this model, the direct effect of  the HRM variable on per-  formance is represented by path c,  and the indirect (mediation) effect  by  paths a and b.  If a, b,  and c are path coefficients, the strength of the  396  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  H  R  M  -a-  1  1  General  Climate  -b+  BDG  Performance  A  Figure I: Mediation Path Model  mediation effect is a x b, and the percentage mediation (i.e., mediation  effecthotal effect) is given by a x b/(a x b + c). In the analyses described  below, model parameters were derived using the full-information maxi-  mum likelihood estimation procedure of the AMOS modelling program  (Arbuckle, 1999). This estimation method can handle missing data, so  each model was estimated using all 137 BDGs.  To  ensure the model  was identified (solvable), the path coefficients from the error variance  components were set to one as shown in Figure 1.  Fifteen different path models were estimated (one for each combi-  nation of HRM and performance outcome) and the results are shown in  Table 3.  The first three data columns of Table 3 show the path coefficients for  the paths depicted in Figure 1, and the next column shows the percentage  of variance in the performance outcome accounted for by the indepen-  dent variables in the model. This is followed by the percentage media-  tion, with the significance level for the null hypothesis of no mediation,  based on a test of  the joint significance of  a and b, which MacKinnon,  Lockwood, Hoffman, West, and Sheets (2002) recommend as yielding  the best combination of Type I error rate and statistical power.  The results show that sizeable proportions of  the variance in BDG  performance can be accounted for by climate and HRM decisions.

In addition, significant mediating effects of  work climate were ob-  tained for five of the HRM-climate-performance  models using individ-  ual performance outcomes, and all three of the models using overall per-  formance.  Overall, these results provide clear support for the role of  work climate as a partial mediator between HRM practices and DMU  performance.  Limitations  The findings of this study should be interpreted within the context of  its limitations.  First, the observations are of  a single organization and  the extent to which they are representative of organizations in general,  or even of  service organizations in general, can be determined only by  reference to the work of other researchers.  Next, what is presumably a causal system has been examined here  using cross-sectional data. That is, although the performance indicators  postdate the climate and HRM measures, each variable is represented  in the data only at a single point in time.  This does not necessarily in-  validate the conclusions that may be drawn because time-lagged corre-  lations suggest that BDG performance is reasonably stable.  The mean  correlations between consecutive quarters for BDG staffing level, over-  time, and staff retention are respectively .78, .71, and .51 (df = 137);  additionally, the correlation between consecutive 2-month periods for  sales against target is .65 (df = 134), and the correlation between BDG  customer satisfaction for September 2000 and the first quarter of  2001  is .68 (df = 135).  Finally, the mediation model we describe is not the only model that  could have been constructed to fit the observed data; it is well known  that  a causal model can usually be replaced by  one or more  equiva-  lent models with identical fit characteristics (Loehlin, 1992, p.  194) and  the choice of model rests on substantive and theoretical considerations.  The issue of substance here is the directionality of the link between cli-  mate and performance; to simplify, does climate cause performance or  does performance cause climate?  In this case, reversing the direction  of causal flow between climate and performance leads to a theoretically  plausible model in which performance is the mediating variable; that is,  effective HRM decisions enhance performance, which in turn leads to  positive employee attitudes. Cross-sectional data cannot distinguish be-  tween these possibilities; longitudinal data is required.  However, the  GELADE AND IVERY  399  evidence from longitudinal studies is mixed.  Ryan, Schmit, and John-  son (1996) found that customer satisfaction predicted subsequent em-  ployee satisfaction, but that employee satisfaction did not predict subse-  quent customer satisfaction, evidence that performance causes climate  rather than vice-versa.  West et al. (1998) found that research  ratings  predicted subsequent climate in university research departments more  strongly than climate predicted  subsequent research  ratings, conclud-  ing that climate was an outcome of  performance rather than a cause.  On the other hand, Ryan, Schmit, and Johnson (1996) found the direc-  tion of  the link between morale and productivity to be indeterminate,  and more emphatically, Koys (2001) found clear evidence that climate  causes performance; specifically, employee satisfaction predicted sub-  sequent customer satisfaction and organizational citizenship behaviour  predicted subsequent profits (rather than the other way round).  Fur-  thermore, Patterson and West (1998) found that significant relationships  between climate, HRM factors, and performance remained when prior  performance was partialled out.  Thus, although alternative models with reversed directionality can-  not be conclusively ruled out, the model presented here is not incompat-  ible with the weight of current evidence, and is broadly consistent with  previous conceptions of the antecedents of DMU performance, and with  the temporal ordering of the variables that were measured.  Finally, we  note that the mediation  model presented  here almost  certainly represents a considerable simplification of  the complex, and  possibly reciprocal, system of  causal relationships that  characterize a  sophisticated commercial DMU.  For  example, low sales effectiveness  may be a consequence of low customer satisfaction, which itself may be a  consequence of high staff turnover. Furthermore, we might suppose that  high levels of turnover may cause chronically low staffing levels, which  in turn might lead to increased overtime demands and to a depressed  work climate, thus reducing sales effectiveness.  We  have carried  out  exploratory structural modelling showing that such a circular system of  relationships would indeed be compatible with the observed data.  Discussion  Many features of the results described here are consistent with prior  research at the DMU level of  analysis.  However, there are also some  differences between this study and prior research on customer satisfac-  tion.  Some service researchers have proposed that customers are influ-  enced by the attitudes expressed by the service employees they encounter  (e.g., Schneider & Bowen, 1992; Ulrich, Halbrook, Mecker, Stucklik, &  Thorpe, 1991).  This supposes that satisfied employees radiate positive  400  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  affect, producing an emotionally satisfying sales experience for the cus-  tomer.  However, in this study, the correlation between general climate  and customer satisfaction is rather weak, and the strongest correlates of  customer satisfaction are staffing level, staff retention, and professional  development. Transfer of affect does not seem to be a wholly satisfactory  explanation for these results.  Examination  of  individual items in the customer satisfaction tele-  phone survey showed that the correlations of staffing level with ratings  of staff politeness, empathy, and friendliness were between .30 and .32,  (df = 137,p < .OOl),  but the strongest correlate of staffing levelwas ease  of contact (T  = .59, df = 137, p < .OOl).  Thus, although customers of  understaffed outlets do experience less positive affect, their main source  of dissatisfaction seems to be the low levels of responsiveness that such  outlets provide.  Staff retention was the strongest correlate of  customer satisfaction.  One explanation is that in DMUs with high levels of turnover, customers  are more likely to encounter inexperienced employees, who are less able  to provide an efficient service.  Two findings support this view.  First,  there is a positive correlation between staff retention and professional  development, which means that high turnover BDGs have fewer qual-  ified staff.  Secondly, high turnover BDGs have lower levels of clerical  accuracy, an indication of inefficiency. However, the nature of the sales  encounter between the customer and employee may moderate the staff  turnover-customer satisfaction relationship. Consistent with the present  findings, Ryan, Schmit, and Johnson (1996) observed a correlation be-  tween turnover and customer satisfaction in a financial services orga-  nization,  but  no correlation between turnover and customer  satisfac-  tion was observed in either Koys’ (2001) study of  restaurants, or Rucci,  Kirn, and Quinn’s (1998) study of  a department store.  Speculatively,  where the relationship between customer and employee has a confiden-  tial component, or is of an advisory nature, a satisfying commercial en-  counter may depend on being recognized by  a service employee or on  being served by  an employee familiar with the customer’s transaction  history, as well as upon professionalism and efficiency. In DMUs with  high levels of turnover, established customers are less likely to encounter  such employees and may accordingly report reduced levels of  satisfac-  tion.  In summary, although customer satisfaction levels may be partly  determined by affective influences, there are reasons to suppose that in  some circumstances, other factors may be equally, or more, important.  Turning to the joint relationships between HRM, climate, and per-  formance, the finding that significant associations between climate and  performance remain after partialling out the common effects of HRM  supports the conception of a direct relationship between climate and per-  GELADE AND IVERY  401  formance, which is independent of HRM decisions. Secondly, the medi-  ating effect of climate observed here is consistent with the empirical find-  ings of Patterson and West (1998) and with the suggestions of previous  writers that progressive HRM practices influence organizational perfor-  mance partly by enhancing climate. There are also, however, strong di-  rect links between HRM decisions and performance that are indepen-  dent of climate and that are consistent with expectations. For example,  both understaffing and overtime working imply elevated job demand,  which is widely accepted to be a potential source of stress and depressed  individual performance; conversely, encouragement of professional de-  velopment is likely to increase individual effectiveness.  These factors  may  underlie the direct  links between HRM  and DMU performance  found here.  The joint role of climate and employee satisfaction as mediators be-  tween HRM and performance remains to be established empirically. In  the models of Kopelman, Brief, and Guzzo (1990), and by  Ostroff and  Bowen (2000), satisfaction and motivation are conceived as a mediating  link between climate and organizational performance, so that climate is  more distal and employee satisfaction is less distal to organizational per-  formance.  This would seem to be a fruitful avenue for future research  but, for the present, we note that the correlations between climate and  performance obtained here are noticeably larger than the mean absolute  uncorrected value of .13 obtained by Harter, Schmidt, and Hayes (2002)  for the correlations between a composite index of employee satisfaction  and engagement and DMU performance.  Conclusion  This study builds on previous research showing that favorable psy-  chological environments in the work place, and progressive HRM prac-  tices such as management of job demand and support for professional  development, are associated with superior organizational performance.  The model of DMU functioning that we have described incorporates cli-  mate and HRM outcomes as joint and interrelated antecedents of DMU  performance and accounts for proportions of the variance in DMU per-  formance that are significant in both statistical and practical terms.  In addition, we  found that  the relationships between  climate and  DMU performance cannot be explained by their common dependence  on HRM factors.  However, the data were compatible with a model in  which HRM decisions have both a direct and an indirect influence on  performance.  In this model, HRM decisions exert their indirect effect  by enhancing or depressing the work climate, which, in turn, produces  subsequent changes in DMU performance.  402  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  Understanding the impact of HRM decisions on employee attitudes  and behavior, and the potential effects on organizational performance,  has considerable practical importance for local management as well as  for central HR practitioners.  In large  organizations, where  decision  making is partially decentralized, local HRM decisions are often strongly  influenced by considerations of  their associated operating costs.  The  cross-sectional relationships demonstrated in this study provide empiri-  cal evidence that HRM decisions, climate, and DMU performance are  connected, but more research-especially longitudinal research-is  re-  quired to establish the extent of causality in this domain.  Many organizations routinely collect HRM and performance data  and conduct climate or employee attitude surveys, but this information is  often compartmentalized at departmental levels. Academic researchers  who would like access to this data need to offer clear benefits to partici-  pating organizations-for  example identification of best and worst prac-  tice and recommendations for performance improvement-to  compen-  sate for the often considerable effort that is needed to integrate these  various data sources.  We would recommend close collaboration with  psychologists and human resource practitioners working in such organi-  zations who are often well placed to collate such information and have  an interest in using the outcomes of the analysis to inform their decision  making.  If  data can be collected on a longitudinal basis, it might prove  possible to evaluate HRM decisions in terms of their long-range impact  on business performance, rather than just in terms of  their immediate  impact on operating costs.
