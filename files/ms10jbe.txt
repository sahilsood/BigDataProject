Journal of Business Ethics (2010) 95:571–601 DOI 10.1007/s10551-010-0441-1 Does Corporate Social Responsibility Inﬂuence Firm Performance of Indian Companies? Ó Springer 2010 Supriti Mishra Damodar Suar ABSTRACT. This study examines whether corporate social responsibility (CSR) towards primary stakeholders influences the financial and the non-financial perfor- mance (NFP) of Indian firms. Perceptual data on CSR and NFP were collected from 150 senior-level Indian managers including CEOs through questionnaire survey. Hard data on financial performance (FP) of the companies were obtained from secondary sources. A questionnaire for assessing CSR was developed with respect to six investors, stakeholder groups – employees, customers, community, natural environment, and suppliers. A composite measure of CSR was obtained by aggregating the six dimensions. Findings indicate that stock-listed firms show responsible business practices and better FP than the non-stock-listed firms. Controlling confounding effects of stock-listing, ownership, and firm size, a favorable perception of managers towards CSR is found to be associated with increase in FP and NFP of firms. Such findings hold good when CSR is assessed for the six stakeholder groups in aggregate and for each stakeholder group in segregate. Findings that responsible business practices towards primary stakeholders can be profitable and beneficial to Indian firms. suggest KEY WORDS: corporate social responsibility, ﬁnancial performance, non-ﬁnancial performance Introduction The relation between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and ﬁrm performance has evoked much interest among researchers. While some studies reveal a positive relation between the two constructs (Graves and Waddock, 1994; Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997; McGuire et al., 1988; Waddock and Graves, 1997), indicate a negative relation (Bromiley and Marcus, 1989; Wright and Ferris, some others 1997), and still others (Aupperle et al., 1985; Teoh et al., 1999) establish no relation between the two constructs. Though a positive relation between CSR and ﬁrm performance has prevailed in many studies (Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Orlitzky et al., 2003), results still remain inconclusive (Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Vogel, 2005). Such inconclusiveness creates ground for further investigation. Corporate social responsibility is predominantly considered as a western phenomenon due to strong institutions, standards, and appeal systems which are weak in developing countries of Asia (Chapple and Moon, 2005). Such weak standards pose considerable challenge to ﬁrms for practicing CSR in developing countries of Asia including India. Though extensive research on CSR inﬂuencing ﬁrm performance has been carried out in developed countries (Belal, 2001), there is a dearth of such studies in India. Current research on CSR in India is mostly limited to self- reported questionnaire surveys on CSR (Khan and Atkinson, 1987; Krishna, 1992), nature and charac- teristics of CSR in India (Arora and Puranik, 2004; Sood and Arora, 2006), and policies and practices of multi-national corporations (MNCs) towards CSR in India (CREM, 2004) without linking it with ﬁrm performance. This study intends to ﬁll that gap. It replicates and extends the past ﬁndings (Tsang and Kwan, 1999) on CSR and ﬁrm performance of western counties. It is intended to be carried out in a different country, in a different time period, in dif- ferent industries, and using different measures. Such replications are warranted to establish the external validity of results and to rebuild the conﬁdence of researchers and practitioners on earlier ﬁndings. Operationalization of CSR has often been a source of debate. Researchers have used various 572 Supriti Mishra and Damodar Suar proxy measures to assess CSR (Aupperle et al., 1985; Cochran and Wood, 1984; Fomburn and Shanley, 1990; McGuire et al., 1988). After introduction of the stakeholder concept (Freeman, 1984), reconﬁg- uration of CSR from stakeholders’ perspective has given a new direction to the evaluation of CSR (Clarkson, 1995). Single-dimensional measures of CSR have been replaced by multi-dimensional measures of CSR that include various stakeholder issues. However, studies using the stakeholders’ perspective often aggregate the dimensions of CSR towards various stakeholders to one composite index while examining its relation with ﬁrm performance (Cochran and Wood, 1984; Ruf et al., 2001; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Such aggregation has facilitated inter-ﬁrm comparison on the level of CSR displayed by ﬁrms. However, such aggregation has ‘masking individual dimensions’ of CSR related to speciﬁc stakeholder groups (Galbreath, 2006). With aggregation, a ﬁrm’s high level of CSR may be driven by favorable CSR policies and practices towards a few stakeholders leaving the issue of other stakeholders fully or par- tially unattended. Analyzing the inﬂuence of such skewed measures of CSR on ﬁrm performance may not reﬂect a true relation between the two con- structs. This necessitates examining the inﬂuence of individual dimensions of CSR on ﬁrm performance. Only few studies have examined the relation between individual CSR dimensions and ﬁrm per- formance (Berman et al., 1999; Graaﬂand and van de Ven, 2006). This study examines the inﬂuence of individual as well as aggregate CSR dimensions on ﬁrm performance. the risk of Past research has mostly used ﬁnancial perfor- mance (FP) measures to assess ﬁrm performance. However, due to the historical nature and rigidity of most of the ﬁnancial measures, assessment of non- ﬁnancial performance (NFP) along with FP is nee- ded to evaluate ﬁrm performance (Govindarajan and Gupta, 1985; Ittner and Larcker, 1998). Because CSR leads for the company such as corporate reputation and image (Schwaiger, 2004), increased employee motivation (Epstein and Roy, 2001), improved brand image (Heal, 2005) and the like, NFP that assesses intan- gible beneﬁts/assets is likely to be inﬂuenced by CSR. While the inﬂuence of CSR on FP is a widely researched area (Zahra and LaTour, 1987), its to many intangible beneﬁts inﬂuence on NFP is a sparsely investigated topic. This study examines the inﬂuence of CSR on both FP and NFP of Indian companies. Conceptual background and hypotheses development CSR in India Asian ﬁrms often lag behind their Western coun- terparts on CSR practices (KPMG, 2005). However, advent of liberalization and globalization, entry of MNCs in Asian markets, rising consumer expecta- tions towards business, and emergence of pressure groups have made the case of CSR stronger in Asian countries including India. But Indian companies mostly focus their CSR activities on community development (PiC, 2004). Philanthropic orientation of Indian businessmen has its roots in history. In the early nineteenth century India, CSR was mainly found in the form of philanthropic contributions by Gujrati and Parsi merchant communities, who pro- vided funds for building schools, pilgrim rest houses, places of worship like temples, distributing relief items during disasters, and helping the poor. A 20-country public opinion survey ﬁnds that India is the last in the level of CSR demanded from companies in any country (Environics International, 2001). A lack of provable link between CSR and ﬁrm performance often discourages companies from engaging in CSR (British Council et al., 2002). Obstacles to CSR are found to be ad hoc approach by the top management towards CSR, lack of con- sensus on priorities within the ﬁrm, and problems related to measurement and evaluation of CSR activities (Krishna, 1992). Unclear policies, bureau- cracy, poor monitoring, complicated tax systems, and poor infrastructure are a few more hindering factors (CSM, 2001). However, there is a growing feeling among the Indians that business organiza- tions must play a wider role in the society besides providing quality products reasonable rates, making their operations environmentally sound, adhering to high labor standards, and reducing hu- man rights abuses at the work place (Kumar et al., 2001). Consequently, Indian companies have started changing their outlook towards CSR by look- ing beyond passive philanthropy. Companies are at CSR and Firm Performance 573 considering CSR for improved brand image and stronger ties with the local community (British Council et al., 2002; PiC, 2004). CSR from stakeholders’ perspective The approach of business organizations to CSR has transcended from merely displaying social concerns to being sensitive and alert to the constituents in the internal and external business environment. These constituents, known as stakeholders, are potent for- ces to accelerate or decelerate a ﬁrm’s performance. With globalization of national boundaries and information technology revolution, companies are under scrutiny from multiple stakeholders including regulators, investors, customers, pressure groups, and the public at large. Corporate scandals are making big news leading to crumbling of well- settled business empires. Recent sub-prime crisis in the US and the subsequent crashing of stock indices of companies across the globe is a case in point. When stakeholders loose conﬁdence in a ﬁrm’s performance, support structure and customer base (Lee, 2008). Customers stop buying products or go for legal suits, share- holders sell their stocks, employees do not perform, and environmental advocates sue (Wood, 1991), all of which directly affect ﬁrm performance. This warrants pursuing meaningful and long-term rela- tions with stakeholders. the ﬁrm loses tight its critical A ﬁrm’s survival and success depends on the ability of its managers to create sufﬁcient wealth and satis- faction for its primary stakeholders (Clarkson, 1995). Primary stakeholders of a ﬁrm include employees, shareholders, customers, suppliers, communities, and natural environment. If any of the primary stake- holder groups withdraws its support to the ﬁrm, the ﬁrm’s operation is adversely affected (Clarkson, 1995). Firms that establish relationship with primary stakeholders beyond market transactions gain com- petitive advantage (Barney and Hansen, 1994; Fomburn and Shanley, 1990). Effective management of key stakeholders acts as a value driver by leveraging performance stakeholder-inﬂicted costs. Lower employee turnover reduces hiring and training costs, loyal suppliers reduce quality certiﬁ- cation costs, supportive communities reduce legal and public relations overhead, and stable shareholders and reducing reduce stock market volatility (McVea and Freeman, 2005). In order to achieve sustainability in business, ﬁrms must identify key stakeholders affecting the ﬁrm, identify their needs, and design organizational policies and practices to cater to them. Accordingly, we deﬁne CSR towards a particular stakeholder group as a ﬁrm’s policies, processes, and practices towards that stakeholder group. The study recognizes primary stakeholders as key stakeholders and deﬁnes CSR from their perspective. Measurement of CSR Past studies on CSR have often been criticized for using inappropriate measures of CSR. Researchers have used various proxy measures to assess CSR: (a) one-dimensional surrogate measures such as repu- tation ranking of companies on pollution control performance (Chen and Metcalf, 1980; Freedman and Jaggi, 1982), (b) Moskowitz’s social responsi- bility ratings (Cochran and Wood, 1984; Mosko- witz, 1972), and (c) Fortune corporate reputation index (Fomburn and Shanley, 1990; McGuire et al., 1988). These measures have been criticized for their inability to incorporate stakeholders’ issues (Aupperle et al., 1985; Ullman, 1985). To overcome such inadequacies, recent studies (Ruf et al., 2001; Waddock and Graves, 1997) use CSR data devel- oped by various agencies that evaluate CSR from stakeholders’ perspective such as the KLD database of Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co., Inc. (Kinder et al., 2005). compact, Voluntary standards such as ISO 14000, OHSAS 18000, Social Accountability (SA) 8000 (SAI, 2001), United Nations’ global and Global Reporting Initiative guidelines (GRI, 2002) outline a wide range of responsible business practices related to stakeholder issues such as environment, occupa- tional health and safety, labor, human rights, cor- ruption, etc. In recent years, an increasing number of companies are making CSR disclosures as per these standards. Nearly 90% of Fortune 500 ﬁrms make CSR disclosures in their annual reports (Boli and Hartsuiker, 2001). However, Indian companies lag behind their global counterparts in terms of CSR disclosure. A recent survey of 27 companies by KPMG ﬁnds that only 25% of the companies are signatories to GRI guidelines, 8% mention about 574 Supriti Mishra and Damodar Suar (CMIE) their social expenditures, and 25% ﬁle CSR reports (Handique, 2008). There is no systematic CSR database of companies in India. There are two widely used secondary database on Indian compa- nies, Prowess database of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economies (Prowess, 2005) and India Business Insight Database (IBID) of Infor- matics India Limited (2003). The former gives access to corporate governance reports and the latter includes newspaper articles on corporate activities including CSR initiatives. Number of mandatory standards included in the Indian Companies Act, 1956, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) guidelines, various pollution prevention acts, and the like give dispersed ideas about the respon- to different sibilities of Indian companies stake- holders. this study develops a comprehensive measure of CSR towards each pri- mary stakeholder group incorporating corresponding social, ethical, legal, and economic issues derived from local and global standards. In this context, Firm performance Grifﬁn and Mahon (1997) have reviewed 51 studies on CSR–ﬁrm performance relationship and found that as many as 80 different types of FP measures have been used. Firm size, return on assets (ROA), return on equity, asset age, and return on sales are the frequently used FP measures. Particularly, ROA is consistently claimed to be an authentic measure of FP (Berman et al., 1999; McGuire et al., 1988). Unlike other accounting measures such as return on equity or return on sales, ROA is not affected by the differential degree of leverage present in ﬁrms. Be- cause ROA is positively correlated with the stock price, a higher ROA implies higher value creation for shareholders. Moreover, in asset-heavy ﬁrms such as the manufacturing ﬁrms, ROA is a better indicator of ﬁrm performance. Financial performance measures are lag indicators and capture historical performance arising from mostly tangible assets (Ong, 2003). They often fail to properly record performance from intangible assets such as customer relationships, employee satisfaction, innovation, investment in research and development, and the like that have become signiﬁcant sources of factors such as competitive advantage for ﬁrms in recent times (Lev, 2000). In contrast, NFP measures focus on a ﬁrm’s long-term success research and development, customer satisfaction, internal business process efﬁciency, innovation, and employee satis- faction, and capture performance improvements from intangible assets (Kaplan and Norton, 2001). Investments in intangible assets such as research and development are expensed immediately instead of getting capitalized in the traditional accounting sys- tem. Such treatment of intangible assets depresses the proﬁt in the current year though beneﬁts from such investments accrue to the ﬁrm over a long period of time. By accounting for such performance improve- ments, NFP measures provide indirect indicators of ﬁrm performance. Because of their focus on conse- quences rather than causes of performance, NFP measures are considered as ‘lead indicators’ (Ittner and Larcker, 2000). FP measures are objective in nature whereas NFP measures are subjective in nat- ure that includes managers’ perception of ﬁrm per- formance on market share, employee health and safety, investment in research and development, and others. Perceptual data on NFP from senior managers correlate with hard data on FP from secondary sources (Venkatraman and Ramanujam, 1987) sug- gesting their complementarity. Hence, FP measures along with NFP measures are used to assess ﬁrm performance holistically (Govindarajan and Gupta, 1985; Ittner and Larcker, 1998). CSR and ﬁrm performance The relations between CSR and FP are mostly inconclusive, but positive relations between the two have been reported in most of the studies (Margolis and Walsh, 2003) suggesting an instrumental orien- tation of CSR initiatives. An instrumental orienta- tion towards CSR suggests the alignment of the social goal with the business goal where CSR is considered as a strategic tool to promote the eco- nomic objective of the ﬁrm. Managers foresee sig- niﬁcant value additions in ﬁrm performance due to strengthened stakeholder relations. Management theorists argue that by improving CSR towards stakeholders, ﬁrm performance augmented (Waddock and Graves, 1997). is CSR and Firm Performance 575 there is social (Boulding and Kirmani, 1993) The inﬂuence of stakeholder-oriented CSR on ﬁrm performance can be understood with the help of three theories: (a) consumer inference making, (b) signaling theory, and (c) identity theory. ‘Consumer inference making’ theory suggests that if a consumer knows that the manufacturer of the product is a responsible ﬁrm, s/he can infer posi- tively about the product (Brown and Dacin, 1997). Such inferences induce consumer goodwill (Brown and Dacin, 1997; Handelman and Arnold, 1999) that inﬂuences purchase intention (Gildea, 1994; Owen and Scherer, 1993). ‘Signaling’ theory (Boulding and Kirmani, 1993; Kirmani, 1997) suggests that in situ- information asymmetry ations where between buyers and sellers, consumers look for information/signals that distinguish companies per- forming well on attributes of interest compared to companies performing poorly. Signals such as war- ranties indicating reliability and higher quality of products enable consumers to decide between companies. Con- sumers associate higher product quality with proac- tive corporate citizenship (Maignan and Ferrell, 2001) and potential job-seekers value CSR record of companies as a signal for organizational attractiveness (Greening and Turban, 2000; Turban and Greening, 1997). ‘Social identity’ theory emphasizes that one’s self-concept is inﬂuenced by membership in differ- ent social organizations, including the company for which an individual works (Ashforth and Mael, 1989; Dutton et al., 1994). Employees’ self-image is inﬂuenced by the image and reputation of their employers, consumers identify themselves with organizations or brands involved in discretionary citizenship (Aaker, 1994; Belk, 1988), and institu- tional investors like to be associated with socially responsible ﬁrms (Graves and Waddock, 1994; Teoh and Shiu, 1990). Such bonds of identiﬁcation encourage positive evaluations of a ﬁrm’s products, and reap value addition through customer loyalty, advocacy, positive words-of-mouth, and resilience to negative brand information (Hoefﬂer and Keller, 2002; Sen et al., 2006). Alternatively, irresponsible behavior by ﬁrms agitates stakeholders. They often react by boycotting the company (Hayes and Pereira, 1990), reducing consumption of the company’s products (Sen and Bhattacharya, 2001), initiating legal action against the company (Greeno and Robinson, 1992), and/or spreading bad words-of-mouth about irresponsible business practices (Clair et al., 1995). Boycotting of Nike products due to human rights’ abuse and unsafe working conditions at suppliers’ locations in Asia (Herbert, 1996), or sharp reaction from environ- mentalists and consumers to the pesticide content in Pepsi and Coca-Cola beverages in India (Financial Express, 2006) are few such instances. While improved stakeholder relations have the potential to improve a ﬁrm’s reputation and performance, strained relations have the risk of adversely affecting a ﬁrm’s performance. Hence, we propose: H1: The favorable CSR towards stakeholders will positively impact the ﬁrms’ FP and NFP. Because we have considered CSR towards six groups of stakeholders, let us examine the relation- ship between CSR towards each stakeholder group and ﬁrm performance. CSR towards employees and ﬁrm performance Proactive policies and practices towards employees reﬂect a company’s intention to address the interests of its employees and satisfy their needs. Policies and practices towards union relations, employees’ par- ticipation in decision making, remuneration policy, working conditions, and elimination of forced/child labor, portray a ﬁrm’s CSR towards employees. By adhering to such standards, ﬁrms can satisfy employ- ees, enhance their job performance, and improve FP and NFP. The Energy Research Institute’s report mentions that Indian stakeholders including work- ers, company executives, and general public feel that Indian companies should adhere to higher labor standards and reduce human rights abuses at the workplace (Kumar et al., 2001). Working conditions that respect human dignity, equality, and social protection result in a productive workplace (Som- avia, 2000). Social responsibility of a company is a reputation factor and is an attractive force for potential (Turban and Greening, 1997). Ethical reputation contributes to job satisfaction and lower employee turnover by evoking positive reactions from employees’ families and friends (Riordan et al., 1997). Because satisﬁed employees have higher morale and job motivation, they will work more effectively and efﬁciently (Berman et al., 1999) and contribute to higher levels and current employees 576 Supriti Mishra and Damodar Suar of organizational effectiveness (Koys, 2001). Past studies establish that better human resource man- agement practices such as training and development of employees, their participation in problem solving, progressive remuneration policies, and grievance procedures increases their productivity and FP (Huselid, 1995; Youndt et al., 1996). A better CSR towards employees which includes wider issues compared to human resource management issues also improves a ﬁrm’s FP (Berman et al., 1999). Hence, reduce employee turnover, H1.1: The favorable CSR towards employees will positively impact the ﬁrms’ FP and NFP. CSR towards customers and ﬁrm performance Positive customer perception about product quality and safety leads to increased sales or decreased costs associated with stakeholder relationships (Waddock and Graves, 1997). Higher product safety and quality improves the bottom line (Berman et al., 1999). In product retailing, market reactions are found to be negative for socially irresponsible companies (Bromiley and Marcus, 1989; Davidson and Worell, 1988). When customers are dissatisﬁed with a product or its associated services, investors appre- hend that negative customer reactions in the form of decreased patronage, lawsuits, or both, will directly affect the bottom line (Berman et al., 1999). Event studies establish that market value of a company decreases when corporate irresponsibility and illegal behavior is observed (Frooman, 1997). The news of pesticide content in Pepsi and Coca-Cola beverages in India reduced the sales of both companies by 60% (Financial Express, 2006). Continuous deterioration in quality directly affects ﬁrm performance (Landon and Smith, 1997). Hence, companies need to be careful about such as ethical advertising standards, customer health and safety during product use, company-wide quality programs for providing better products at right prices and the like. Company policies and practices to address such issues give a positive signal about a company’s responsible atti- tude towards its customers and can improve ﬁrm performance. Hence, factors H1.2: The favorable CSR towards customers will positively impact the ﬁrms’ FP and NFP. towards insider and information systems, CSR towards investors and ﬁrm performance Firms can strengthen their investor relations by adopting proper governance standards. After the corporate governance debacles in 1990s such as that of Enron in the US, the stock market crisis in India, and falling corporate governance standards across the globe, a lot of importance is being given to governance codes and laws for protecting the interests of shareholders and investors. These codes stress the need for transparency in ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial disclosures, adoption of internation- ally compatible accounting standards, appropriate board processes and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. CSR towards investors examine ﬁrm policies and practices towards such issues including shareholders’ inde- participation in decision making, auditors’ pendence, and policies trading. Evidence suggests that adoption of better corporate governance standards increases ﬁrm performance. Investors show willingness to pay a premium for the stocks of well-governed companies compared to poor-governed companies (Coombes and Watson, 2000). Companies with the highest rankings in good governance practices also have the highest FP (Business Week, 2002). Positive relations are found between corporate governance and stock price performance and ﬁnancial ratios in emerging mar- kets (CLSA, 2000). Companies ranked in the top quarter of corporate governance yield a better average return on capital employed compared to companies ranked in the bottom half (CLSA, 2000). Companies that comply with the Cadbury Com- mittee recommendations in the UK experience better performance as compared to the non- complying ﬁrms (Dahya and McConnell, 2007). Past research on the inﬂuence of corporate gover- nance indicators such as board size on ﬁrm per- formance has yielded both positive (Dalton et al., 1998) and negative outcomes (Alshimmiri, 2004). However, in the Indian context, studies suggest that properly designed mandatory corporate governance reforms increase share prices (Black and Khanna, 2007). Market value of Indian companies such as Infosys that follows stricter governance and disclo- sure standards increased as high as 2000 times while that of poor governed ﬁrms declined as low as 95% during 1995–2000 (Nemkumar, 2000). Hence, CSR and Firm Performance 577 H1.3: The favorable CSR towards investors will positively impact the ﬁrms’ FP and NFP. H1.4: The favorable CSR towards community will positively impact the ﬁrms’ FP and NFP. CSR towards community and ﬁrm performance Typical involvement of business with the commu- nity is seen in areas of education, health, and income generation. CSR towards community is seen in terms of philanthropic giving, public–private part- nerships, community relationships, and participation in social and economic development issues. Of late, companies are pursuing meaningful partnerships with non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to empower the local community. Endeavors by Indian companies such as Kishan Kendras1 by Tata group, e-Choupals and KisanIndia.com by ITC, Shubh Labh2 services by Mahindra, and Kisan Kendra by Ralli empower rural Indian farmers (Singh and Bhagat, 2004). Initiatives by MNCs such as Microsoft’s partnership with an NGO, Pratham, to promote quality primary education in rural India (Brugmann and Prahalad, 2007) or Hewlett Packard’s living lab experiment with women self-help groups in rural Andhra Pradesh (India) to provide them sustainable livelihoods (Dunn and Yamashita, 2003) are few more examples. When ﬁrms social actions on communities in and around their area of operation, they reap the beneﬁts of a socially responsible image among their employees and the local community (Husted, 2003). Partnership of Life Insurance Corporation of India with micro-credit federations in the rural Andhra Pradesh, besides improving its penetration of the rural market and expanding the customer base, has also increased its gross margin by 27% (Brugmann and Prahalad, 2007). Indian Market Research Bureau ﬁnds that after Hindustan Lever Limited, a fast moving con- sumer goods company, launched an initiative called ‘Project Shakti’ rural women in India, the consumption of its products increased in the range 15–20% (Sood and Arora, 2006). Though past evidence suggests a negative relation between CSR towards the community and ﬁrm performance (Berman et al., 1999), it is also observed that investments in community develop- ment activities help a ﬁrm to obtain competitive advantages through tax savings, decreased regulatory burden, and improvements in the quality of local labor (Waddock and Graves, 1997). Hence, for creating livelihood of focus their CSR towards environment and ﬁrm performance Recent years have seen mounting global pressure for enactment and adoption of stricter legislations per- taining to environment protection in and around the globe. Companies are taking proactive initiatives for emission reduction in anticipation of future policy, and societal and competitive developments with respect to environment. With increasing importance of environmental friendly products, processes, and services, ﬁrms are realizing the importance of adopt- ing environmental standards for their sustainability in the long run. This has facilitated development of green resources and capabilities and compliance with international standards such as ISO 14000, OHSAS 18000, and environmental legislations. Environ- mental performance is enhanced by improvements in three aspects – (a) product technologies such as use of recycled raw materials and other resource saving programs, (b) process technologies such as use of efﬁcient production systems and end-of-pipe con- trols, and (c) management systems such as workers’ training programs and environmental audit. Global standards on CSR towards environment endorse these aspects. Research on environmental proactivity has not been conclusive (Christman, 2000). But studies link environmental commitment with en- hanced proﬁtability, particularly in high growth industries (Russo and Fouts, 1997). Evidence suggests proactive environment management enhances ﬁrm’s market value (Klassen and Mc Laughlin, 1996), rep- utation, and FP (Alvarez et al., 2001; Miles and Co- vin, 2000). The impact of ﬁrms’ proactive environmental practices on market share, proﬁtabil- ity, and return on investment is better in environ- mentally conscious companies compared to not-so- conscious companies (Ahmed et al., 1998). Hence, H1.5: The favorable CSR towards environment will positively impact the ﬁrms’ FP and NFP. CSR towards suppliers and ﬁrm performance Inﬂuence of suppliers has become crucial in recent years as companies have started focusing more on their core competencies, outsourcing other 578 Supriti Mishra and Damodar Suar Standards on CSR towards functions to suppliers (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990). Recent years have seen growing importance of suppliers’ issues such as health and safety, environ- mental impact, community involvement, and the payment of living wages to employees at both out- sourced plant locations and home locations of sup- pliers. suppliers incorporate such issues besides including issues such as ethical procurement of raw materials by suppliers, and elimination of child labor and human rights’ violation at suppliers’ locations. By ensuring adher- ence of CSR standards by suppliers, a ﬁrm sends strong signals about its commitment towards CSR, which improves its image and performance. Viola- tion of CSR standards by suppliers adversely affects a ﬁrm’s performance. Banning of Indian carpet-mak- ing ﬁrms by international buyers for their use of child labor in carpet making is a case in point. International buyers prefer Rugmark certiﬁcation which ensures that a ﬁrm has not used child labor. Such preferences improve ﬁrm performance. Hence, H1.6: The favorable CSR towards suppliers will positively impact the ﬁrms’ FP and NFP (Figure 1). Control variable First, ﬁrms that are listed in stock exchanges tend to disclose more CSR related information compared to the non-listed ﬁrms as performance of listed ﬁrms is continuously monitored and evaluated by multiple stakeholders investors, ﬁnancial analysts, such as and higher media, and the like. Positive CSR disclosures have positive inﬂuence on stock prices (Anderson and Frankle, 1980; Shane and Spicer, 1983). Better CSR of a ﬁrm inﬂuences investment decisions of institu- tional investors by improving a ﬁrm’s access to capital (Graves and Waddock, 1994; Pava and Krausz, 1996) and reducing the cost of capital. Thus stock-listing of companies inﬂuences both CSR and ﬁrm perfor- mance. Second, type of ownership of companies, state-owned or private-owned, affects both the CSR and ﬁrm performance. State-owned enterprises (SOEs), which laid the foundation of industrializa- tion in India, coexist with private sector companies in many key sectors. SOEs are generally identiﬁed with characteristics such as larger work force, stronger labor laws, employee-friendly work environment and beneﬁt plans, investment on peripheral development. Private sector companies lag with respect to such characteristics. Proﬁt motive is not the primary focus of SOEs like private enter- prises. This suggests the prevalence of more CSR in SOEs compared to private enterprises. In a review of 54 studies in different countries on SOE versus pri- vate sector performance, 32 show private companies to be more proﬁtable than SOEs (Boardman and Vining, 1989). Similar ﬁndings are concurred in the Indian manufacturing sector (Ganesh, 2001). This suggests that type of ownership affects both CSR and ﬁrm performance. Third, ﬁrm size also inﬂuences CSR (Fomburn and Shanley, 1990) and ﬁrm per- formance (Robins and Wiersema, 1995). Larger ﬁrms are relatively better positioned than smaller ﬁrms to invest more funds for CSR activities. Past research has considered annual sales (Fomburn and Shanley, 1990), total assets, and number of employees (Waddock and Graves, 1997) as indicators of ﬁrm size. Because listing in stock exchanges, type of ownership, and ﬁrm size are likely to inﬂuence CSR and ﬁrm performance, without controlling their confounding effects, the CSR-ﬁrm performance link cannot be gauged appropriately. Method Sample Figure 1. Conceptual model depicting the inﬂuence of CSR on FP and NFP. Data were collected from Indian manufacturing companies included in the Prowess database of CSR and Firm Performance 579 (a) minimum capital CMIE, the largest database of Indian companies. Three criteria were set for inclusion of companies in the sample: investment of 250 million (Indian rupees), (b) a minimum number of 100 employees in the ﬁrm, and (c) a minimum of 5 years of manufacturing operation. Such criteria excluded small ﬁrms and start-up units from the sample. As per the Prowess database (Prowess, 2005), there are 2932 manufacturing companies in India with a minimum capital investment of 250 million (Indian rupees). Out of these, 85 companies are SOEs and the rest are private sector enterprises. Fifteen hundred companies (51% of the total num- ber of companies in Prowess) were randomly selected from the database representing 18 categories of manufacturing industries. Out of the selected companies, 150 companies responded to the ques- tionnaire survey and the response rate was 10%. Out of the 150 respondent companies, 31 were SOEs and 119 were private sector enterprises, and 101 were listed in Indian stock exchanges (Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange), and 49 were not listed in any stock exchange. As CSR decisions are mainly taken by the top management in ﬁrms, CEOs and in their absence senior executives such as vice-presidents, directors, senior general managers, or general managers participated in the survey. Data were collected from industrial belts of eight major cities situated in six states out of 35 states and union territories representing India. A web-enabled version of the questionnaire was developed and sent through e-mail to 900 companies which had e-mail ids. After three reminders over a period of 2 months, only 23 (2.5%) CEOs returned the ﬁlled-in questionnaires through e-mail. Ques- tionnaires were sent to another 600 companies by post which did not have any e-mail id. Though return envelopes along with postage were attached with the questionnaire, only 10 companies returned the ﬁlled-in questionnaires within a period of 4 months. Finally, out of the non-responding com- panies, 400 companies were directly contacted by the researcher at their corporate head ofﬁces in the north, south, and east zones of India. Prior communication was made to companies through e-mail or telephone, and appointments were ﬁxed with the top executives. In the ﬁrst meeting with the senior executives, the researcher left the questionnaire with them after explaining the objective of the survey. Because the questionnaire covered a wide range of issues con- cerning different departments such as the human resource department (employees), marketing depart- ment (customers), purchase department (suppliers), and the like, the executives took time to ﬁll up the data in consultation with the concerned departments. After a period of 2 weeks, respondents were con- tacted to return the ﬁlled-in questionnaires. From the 400 companies, ﬁlled-in questionnaires were pro- cured from 117 companies. All in all, 150 (23 + 10 + 117) questionnaires were obtained. Demographic details of executives were collected as part of the questionnaire survey. Data on age, years of service, education, and monthly salary of CEOs and top-level executives (M age = 49.53, SD = 7.13; M years of service = 13.79, SD = 10.19; M years of formal study = 18.74, SD = 2.22) were obtained through questionnaire surveys. Among the respondents, 92% had at least one pro- fessional qualiﬁcation like engineering or manage- ment degree. Average monthly gross salary of respondents in various industries varied from as low as 35,000 (Indian rupees) to as high as 1,257,261 (Indian rupees). Respondents were male members in 146 of the 150 ﬁrms indicating the low representa- tion of women in the top management. The sam- ple companies had a minimum number of 105 employees and a maximum number of 446,721 employees. The public sector companies had aver- age employee strength of 22,026 within a range 265–446,721. The average employee strength in private sector companies was 2227 within a range 105–40,000. The average employee strength in the 18 categories of industries was within a range 270– 7953. The sample proﬁle of the 18 categories of industries is summarized in Table I. Measures Besides socio-demographic variables of the respon- dents, data on CSR towards different stakeholders along with NFP were procured through question- naire. Respondents were assured complete ano- nymity of their responses. CSR Items for assessing CSR towards six stakeholder groups were developed after examining the issues 580 Supriti Mishra and Damodar Suar TABLE I Sample proﬁle of surveyed industries Type of industry No. of Ownership companies Public Private Average employee (Min–Max) Average monthly gross salary (in Indian rupees) (Min–Max) Automobile Cement Chemicals and fertilizers Coal and lignite Construction Consumer goods and food products Crude oil and natural gas Drugs and pharmaceuticals Electricity Electronics and telecom Machinery Other agricultural products Paper and paper products Plastics and polymers Shipping Steel and aluminum Textiles Tyres and tubes Total 11 5 14 1 3 13 8 12 10 4 24 3 2 5 1 18 13 3 150 1 – 1 1 3 1 5 – 5 – 9 – – – 1 3 – 1 31 10 5 13 – – 12 3 12 5 4 15 3 2 5 – 15 13 2 119 2600 (350–12,089) 1471 (478–5027) 696 (105–1800) 291,515 (31,300–1,228,831) 162,100 (25,500–600,000) 139,036 (35,000–500,000) 446,721 (–) 1633 (849–2550) 7889 (300–36,000) 7953 (200–34,722) 1571 (410–5700) 2965 (131–24,044) 270 (157–500) 4900 (142–43,000) 981 (473–1800) 589 (548–630) 554 (200–1200) 3508 (–) 4682 (150–40,000) 1795 (290–43,600) 901 (280–1462) 6319 (105–446,721) 42,000 (–) 40,454 (38,000–44,361) 865,267 (29,000–9,323,000) 65,609 (32,000–125,000) 1,257,261 (42,000–8,275,000) 59,935 (22,000–120,000) 92,859 (41,435–195,000) 90,596 (35,000–570,000) 86,000 (54,000–130,000) 43,000 (41,000–45,000) 53,500 (34,000–76,000) 35,000 (–) 133,189 (32,000–841,954) 196,548 (30,000–1,483,000) 1,448,056 (28,500–4,235,667) 307,172 (22,000–9,323,000) covered under various global standards such as KLD database (Kinder et al., 2005), GRI guidelines (GRI, 2002), SA 8000 (SAI, 2001), and relevant ISO standards. We also referred to local standards speci- ﬁed in the Indian Companies Act, 1956, the SEBI guidelines, and pollution prevention acts in India with respect to air, water, and noise, and voluntary codes such as the UNDP–CII social code for busi- ness, jointly developed by the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII) and United Nations Devel- opment Program (UNDP). In addition, the 27-item scale developed by Benito and Benito (2005) was adopted for the environmental section of the ques- tionnaire. An initial pool of 70 items was reduced to 61 after pilot testing of the questionnaire in 10 companies. The 61 items were given to three experts working in the area of CSR. They were asked to judge the appropriateness of the items to assess CSR of Indian manufacturing companies the six stake- holders. All these items were agreed to by the three experts and were retained for the ﬁnal survey. In towards addition, the convergent validity of the constructs was tested by conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA). Along with descriptive statistics, unstandardized and standardized regression weights, various ﬁt measures of goodness of ﬁt index (GFI), comparative ﬁt index (CFI), normed ﬁt index (NFI), and root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of the scales were obtained (see Table V in Appendix). Minimum of the model was achieved indicating the ﬁt of each CSR construct to data. Because items were causal indicators and not affect (Bollen and Lenox, 1991), few items had non-signiﬁcant loadings. Despite the non-signiﬁcant loadings, we retained them because they represented distinct issues relevant to the stakeholder groups and each construct had high inter-item consistency (Cronbach alpha ‡0.70). indicators Corporate social responsibility was measured sep- arately for each stakeholder (see Table V in Appendix for item details). Thirteen items assessed CSR towards employees including issues such as equal opportunity action plan, anti-discrimination policies, and provi- sions covering health and safety at work (Cronbach CSR and Firm Performance 581 investors including issues alpha = 0.74). Seven items examined CSR towards customers covering issues such as commitment to provide quality products and services, pricing prod- ucts as per quality, and voluntary codes for advertising (Cronbach alpha = 0.70). Seven items evaluated such as CSR towards rules investor grievance handling policies, to independence, and policies strengthen auditor’s towards prohibiting insider trading (Cronbach alpha = 0.72). CSR towards community was evalu- ated with 12 items comprising issues such as supporting third party social and sustainable devel- opment initiatives, and community partnerships (Cronbach alpha = 0.78). Issues such as systems for measuring environmental performance, end-of-pipe controls, and environmental training for managers were included in the 17 items assessing CSR towards natural environment (Cronbach alpha = 0.91). CSR towards suppliers was evaluated on ﬁve items (Cronbach alpha = 0.76) including issues such as safety and environmental aspects, and policies on the restrictions of sweat shop/human rights’ violation at suppliers’ locations. Each respondent was asked to endorse the degree of compliance of the ﬁrm with respect to the issues mentioned in the questionnaire. Response descriptions against each item were given on a ﬁve-point scale – ’it is not in the company code’ (=1), ‘it is in the company code but not implemented’ (=2), ‘it is in the company code but partially imple- mented’ (=3), ‘it is in the company code and sub- stantially implemented’ (=4), and ‘it is in the company code and fully implemented’ (=5). The summative score on all items of CSR towards a particular stakeholder group was divided by the number of items to keep that value within the range of the scale. Aggregation of CSR in the past research has been (Moore, done by (a) adding various dimensions to the various 2001), and (b) assigning weights dimensions on the basis of expert panel ratings (Waddock and Graves, 1997). In order to assess whether all the dimensions of CSR could be added to one aggregate variable, CFA was carried out on the scores of six dimensions of CSR. The relative chi-square value (v2/df = 3.54) of the one-factor model was not below the recommended cut-off criterion of 3. However, the other ﬁt measures – GFI (=0.92), CFI (=0.96), and NFI (=0.94) – were above the recommended cut-off criterion of 0.90 (Bollen, 1989) the model. suggesting the ﬁt of Moreover, the response descriptions against each item of CSR measures were on a uniform ﬁve-point scale. Therefore, the scores on six segregated mea- sures of CSR were averaged to specify the aggregate CSR. The inter-item alpha reliability of all the 61 items was high (Cronbach alpha = 0.88). Firm performance FP. In order to control industry inﬂuences, FP was assessed using industry-adjusted ROA. Industry- adjusted ROA was obtained by subtracting average industry ROA of each industry category from the ROA of each ﬁrm in the corresponding industry category (Agle et al., 1999; Fowler and Schmidt, 1988). Data on ROA for each of 150 ﬁrms and each of 18 categories of industries were collected from the CMIE-Prowess database for 3 years from 2003– 2004 to 2005–2006. ROA of companies, whose data were not available in the database, was calculated from the balance sheets of companies available in annual reports for the above 3 years as the ratio of operating income to total assets [ROA = {Net operating income 9 (1 - tax rate)}/Average operat- ing assets] (Copeland et al., 2000). A 3-year average of ﬁrm-level and industry-level ROAs was obtained to eliminate possible biases that may result from a single-year ﬁgure. NFP. A 12-item scale developed by Govindarajan (1984) and modiﬁed by Hoque (2004) was considered to assess the NFP. The 12 items in the modiﬁed ver- sion are: (1) sales growth rate, (2) market share, (3) operating proﬁts, (4) workplace relations, (5) cash ﬂow from operations, (6) return on investment, (7) new product development, (8) market development, (9) research and development, (10) cost reduction programs, (11) personnel development, and (12) employee health and safety. Senior managers were requested to indicate the relative position of their companies with respect to the industry average on each item. Response descriptions against each item were given on a ﬁve-point scale – ‘well below average’ (=1), ‘below average’ (=2), ‘average’ (=3), ‘above average’ (=4), ‘well above average’ (=5). NFP on all items were obtained for 3 years from 2003–2004 to 2005–2006. The annual average value of NFP [(NFP2003–2004 + NFP2004–2005 + NFP2005–2006)/3] for each of the 12 items was calculated. On such average, items had high inter-item consistency 582 Supriti Mishra and Damodar Suar (Cronbach alpha = 0.89). The annual average value of NFP on 12 items was further averaged by dividing it with the number of items to keep the value within the range of the scale. High average score indexed high NFP. Control variable Listing in stock exchanges, type of ownership, and ﬁrm size were the control variables. Data on stock- listing status, ownership type, and annual sales were obtained from the CMIE-Prowess database. Data on number of employees were obtained from the respondents. Stock-listing status and ownership type were coded as dummy variables (non-listed = 0, listed = 1; public = 0, private = 1). Two indicators of ﬁrm size were considered for the study, (a) number of employees (as on 31 March, 2006) and (b) average sales (average of 3 years’ net sales from 2003–2004 to 2005–2006), which were continuous variables. From the data of annual sales for 3 years, the average annual sales ﬁgure was considered for analysis. Results Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation among the studied variables are presented (Table II). Posi- tive correlations were found between stock-listing status and aggregate CSR indicating that listed companies showed a higher CSR. Positive correla- tions between stock-listing status and FP implied that listed companies performed better than non- listed companies. However, stock-listing status did not relate to NFP. Similarly, the other two control variables, type of ownership, and the ﬁrm size did not relate to FP and NFP. Correlation results showed that FP and NFP of the companies were related indicating a higher FP also implied a higher NFP. The correlation between CSR and ﬁrm per- formance indicated that a more favorable aggregate CSR towards all the six stakeholders – employees, customers, investors, community, environment, and suppliers – resulted in a higher industry-adjusted ROA and NFP of the ﬁrms. A favorable CSR towards each of the six stakeholders also enhanced the FP and NFP of ﬁrms. The correlation between two variables incorpo- rates bidirectional relations that are unreserved in regression analysis. To examine the inﬂuence of control variables, aggregate CSR, and segregate CSR on FP and NFP of ﬁrms, hierarchical regres- sion analyses were carried out. In the regression analysis for FP, three control variables were entered in the ﬁrst step (Table III). In congruence with the correlation results, of the three control variables, only stock-listing status of com- panies positively inﬂuenced FP suggesting that the listed ﬁrms were ﬁnancially better of than the non- listed ﬁrms. In the second step of the regression analysis, partialing out the inﬂuence of control variables, an increase in aggregate and segregate CSR enhanced the FP of ﬁrms. In the hierarchical regression analysis for NFP, similar to the results of correlation analysis, none of the control variables inﬂuenced NFP in the ﬁrst step (Table IV). But in the second step of the regression analysis, both aggregate and segregate CSR posi- tively inﬂuenced the NFP. Results supported the main hypothesis (H1) and (H1.1–H1.6). Both aggregate and its components segregate CSR predicting FP and NFP were sig- niﬁcant the socially responsible business yielded higher performance of manufac- turing ﬁrms. suggesting that Controlling the confounding effects, aggregate CSR predicted 12% variance of industry-adjusted ROA (Table III) and 20% variance of NFP (Table IV). The segregate measures of CSR, incor- porating the CSR towards six stakeholder groups, explained from as low as 3% to as high as 14% var- iance of the industry-adjusted ROA and from as low as 7% to as high as 19% variance of NFP. First, such ﬁndings suggested that listed ﬁrms had better CSR and FP than non-listed ones. Second, controlling the confounding effects, both the aggregate and segre- gate measures of CSR predicted FP and NFP of ﬁrms but CSR inﬂuenced the NFP of ﬁrms more potently compared to FP of ﬁrms. Third, the non- explained variance of FP and NFP suggested that there were other potent explanatory variables be- yond the aggregate and segregate measures of CSR and the relations between the explanatory variables and the criterion were not linearly robust. CSR and Firm Performance 583 0 0 . 1 2 6 . 3 7 6 . 0 * * * 2 3 . 0 * * * 3 4 . 0 * * * 8 3 . 0 * * * 4 4 . 0 * * * 2 3 . 0 * * * 7 2 . 0 * * * 1 3 . 0 * * * 6 4 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * * 5 4 . 0 * * * 0 3 . 0 * * * 9 3 . 0 * * 5 2 . 0 * * * 6 2 . 0 * * * 6 2 . 0 * * * 1 4 . 0 1 0 . 0 - 2 0 . 0 - 0 0 . 1 * * * 3 6 . 0 * * * 9 5 . 0 * * * 2 6 . 0 * * * 2 3 . 0 * * * 0 6 . 0 * * * 2 8 . 0 3 0 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * * 4 6 . 0 * * * 3 6 . 0 * * * 8 3 . 0 * * * 0 6 . 0 * * * 3 8 . 0 1 0 . 0 - 0 0 . 1 * * * 1 7 . 0 * * * 9 3 . 0 * * * 4 6 . 0 * * * 8 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * * 6 3 . 0 * * * 4 8 . 0 * * * 7 8 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * * 2 3 . 0 * * * 6 5 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * * 3 8 . 0 0 0 . 1 0 0 . 1 5 0 . 0 0 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 1 1 . 0 5 0 . 0 0 0 . 1 0 0 . 0 5 0 . 0 9 0 . 0 5 0 . 0 6 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 2 0 . 0 2 0 . 0 3 0 . 0 3 1 . 0 8 1 . 0 2 1 . 0 0 8 . 2 8 0 . 1 0 7 . 3 0 9 . 0 1 4 . 3 5 7 . 0 1 8 . 3 7 8 . 0 4 7 . 3 4 7 . 0 7 3 . 3 8 6 . 0 7 4 . 3 6 6 . 0 8 9 . 2 8 6 6 1 2 . 9 1 3 6 9 3 . 8 2 4 8 2 1 2 . 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 . 1 * * 2 2 . 0 - 4 0 . 0 - 3 0 . 0 - 5 0 . 0 - 5 0 . 0 6 0 . 0 - 2 0 . 0 - 5 0 . 0 - 0 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 6 0 . 0 - 9 7 . 0 1 4 . 0 * * 1 2 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * 9 1 . 0 * 7 1 . 0 - 9 0 . 0 - 9 0 . 0 6 1 . 0 9 0 . 0 2 1 . 0 * * 4 2 . 0 * 7 1 . 0 R S C e t a g e r g g A l e e y o p m e R S C r e m o t s u c R S C r o t s e v n i R S C y t i n u m m o c R S C p i h s r e n w O s e e y o p m E l d e t s i L s e l a S . 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 . 6 . 7 . 8 . 9 t n e m n o r i v n e R S C . 0 1 r e i l p p u s R S C . 1 1 * * * 2 3 . 0 A O R d e t s u d a - y r t s u d n I j . 2 1 5 0 . 0 7 6 . 0 7 4 . 0 P F N . 3 1 M D S . 1 0 0 . 0 < p * * * ; 1 0 . 0 < p * * ; 5 0 . 0 < p * I I E L B A T P F N d n a , A O R d e t s u j d a - y r t s u d n i , R S C , e z i s m r ﬁ , p i h s r e n w o , g n i t s i l - k c o t s r o f s n o i t a l e r r o c d n a s c i t s i t a t s e v i t p i r c s e D 3 1 2 1 1 1 0 1 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 s e l b a i r a V 584 Supriti Mishra and Damodar Suar Regression analysis of CSR predicting industry-adjusted ROA TABLE III DV Step IV Industry-adjusted ROA 1 2 Industry-adjusted ROA 1 2 Industry-adjusted ROA 1 2 Industry-adjusted ROA 1 2 Industry-adjusted ROA 1 2 Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales Aggregate CSR Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales CSR-employee Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales CSR-customer Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales CSR-investor Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales CSR-community B 0.08 -0.03 0.00 0.00 0.05 -0.02 0.00 0.00 0.09 0.08 -0.03 0.00 0.00 0.07 -0.03 0.00 0.00 0.06 0.08 -0.03 0.00 0.00 0.07 -0.03 0.00 0.00 0.03 0.08 -0.03 0.00 0.00 0.07 -0.03 0.00 0.00 0.04 0.08 -0.03 0.00 0.00 0.06 -0.02 0.00 0.00 0.08 SEB 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.02 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.02 B R2 DR2 F 0.23** 0.05 2.07 -0.08 0.03 0.01 0.16* -0.06 0.02 -0.02 0.35*** 0.23** -0.08 0.03 0.01 0.20** -0.07 0.01 -0.02 0.26*** 0.23** -0.08 0.03 0.01 0.21** -0.08 0.02 0.01 0.16* 0.23** -0.08 0.03 0.01 0.20** -0.06 0.02 -0.02 0.24** 0.23** -0.08 0.03 0.01 0.18* -0.06 0.04 -0.01 0.37*** 0.17 0.12 5.96*** 0.05 2.07 0.12 0.07 3.91** 0.05 2.07 0.08 0.03 2.42* 0.05 2.07 0.11 0.06 3.47** 0.05 2.07 0.19 0.14 6.80*** CSR and Firm Performance 585 TABLE III continued DV Step IV Industry-adjusted ROA 1 2 Industry-adjusted ROA 1 2 Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales CSR-environment Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales CSR-supplier B 0.08 -0.03 0.00 0.00 0.06 -0.02 0.00 0.00 0.06 0.08 -0.03 0.00 0.00 0.05 -0.03 0.00 0.00 0.05 SEB 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.01 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.03 0.03 0.00 0.00 0.01 B R2 DR2 F 0.23** 0.05 2.07 -0.08 0.03 0.01 0.18* -0.05 0.03 0.01 0.31*** 0.23** -0.08 0.03 0.01 0.16* -0.07 0.02 -0.01 0.31*** 0.15 0.10 4.89*** 0.05 2.07 0.14 0.09 4.81*** DV dependent variable, IV independent variable, B beta, SEB standard error of beta, b standardized beta, R2 coefﬁcient of determination. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Discussion Analyzing the data from 150 Indian companies, the study examines the inﬂuence of CSR on ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial ﬁrm performance. CSR was assessed with respect to six primary stakeholders as well as with respect to the aggregation of all stake- holders. Results show that ﬁrms that are listed in stock exchanges have better CSR and FP, but nei- ther the ownership pattern nor ﬁrm size has inﬂu- enced CSR, FP, and NFP. Controlling the confounding effects of stock-listing status, ownership pattern, and ﬁrm size, an increase in the aggregate measure of CSR has increased the FP and NFP of ﬁrms. Also, more favorable CSR towards each of the stakeholders has increased ﬁrm performance. Stock-listing, ownership, ﬁrm size, and CSR A favorable inﬂuence of stock-listing status on CSR establishes that listed ﬁrms whose performance is monitored regularly by multiple stakeholders display a higher level of CSR compared to the non-listed ﬁrms. Due to such monitoring and exposure to multiple stakeholders, listed ﬁrms perform ﬁnancially better than the non-listed ones. Performance of the listed ﬁrms is shown in the balance sheets through the measures of FP. Hence, stock-listing inﬂuences FP of ﬁrms. However, it does not inﬂuence NFP which is a subjective measure and is not captured in balance sheets for evaluation by multiple stakeholders. Lack of inﬂuence of ownership and ﬁrm size on CSR and ﬁrm performance establishes that there is no differ- ence between the SOEs and private sector companies in India with respect to the level of CSR displayed by them. Private sector companies such as Tata Steel and Apollo Tyres are as responsible as the SOEs such as Rastriya Ispat Nigam Limited and Gas Authority of India Limited. Furthermore, larger ﬁrms do not always display a high level of CSR compared to the smaller ﬁrms (Wu, 2006). Smaller ﬁrms like Orissa Milk Federation are as sensitive to stakeholders as larger ﬁrms in the same category like AMUL. 586 Supriti Mishra and Damodar Suar TABLE IV Regression analysis of CSR predicting NFP DV Step IV NFP NFP NFP NFP NFP 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales Aggregate CSR Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales CSR-employee Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales CSR-customer Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales CSR-investor Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales CSR-community B 0.09 -0.08 0.00 0.00 -0.05 -0.04 0.00 0.00 0.47 0.09 -0.08 0.00 0.00 0.04 -0.06 0.00 0.00 0.30 0.09 -0.08 0.00 0.00 0.03 -0.10 0.00 0.00 0.24 0.09 -0.08 0.00 0.00 0.04 -0.05 0.00 0.00 0.24 0.09 -0.08 0.00 0.00 0.01 -0.05 0.00 0.00 0.40 SEB 0.12 0.14 0.00 0.00 0.11 0.13 0.00 0.00 0.08 0.12 0.14 0.00 0.00 0.12 0.14 0.00 0.00 0.08 0.12 0.14 0.00 0.00 0.12 0.14 0.00 0.00 0.07 0.12 0.14 0.00 0.00 0.12 0.14 0.00 0.00 0.06 0.12 0.14 0.00 0.00 0.11 0.13 0.00 0.00 0.07 b 0.07 -0.05 0.13 -0.01 -0.03 -0.02 0.10 -0.05 0.46*** 0.07 -0.05 0.13 -0.01 0.03 -0.03 0.10 -0.04 0.30*** 0.07 -0.05 0.13 -0.01 0.02 -0.06 0.11 -0.01 0.27*** 0.07 -0.05 0.13 -0.01 0.03 -0.03 0.11 -0.05 0.31*** 0.07 -0.05 0.13 -0.01 0.00 -0.03 0.13 -0.04 0.44*** DR2 R2 0.02 F 0.84 0.22 0.20 8.35*** 0.02 0.84 0.11 0.09 3.59** 0.02 0.84 0.09 0.07 2.89* 0.02 0.84 0.12 0.10 3.83** 0.02 0.84 0.21 0.19 7.74*** CSR and Firm Performance 587 DV Step IV NFP NFP 1 2 1 2 Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales CSR-environment Listed Ownership Employees Sales Listed Ownership Employees Sales CSR-supplier TABLE IV continued B 0.09 -0.08 0.00 0.00 -0.01 -0.03 0.00 0.00 0.28 0.09 -0.08 0.00 0.00 -0.07 -0.05 0.00 0.00 0.28 SEB 0.12 0.14 0.00 0.00 0.12 0.13 0.00 0.00 0.06 0.12 0.14 0.00 0.00 0.11 0.13 0.00 0.00 0.05 b 0.07 -0.05 0.13 -0.01 0.00 -0.02 0.12 -0.01 0.37*** 0.07 -0.05 0.13 -0.01 -0.05 -0.03 0.11 -0.04 0.44*** R2 0.02 DR2 F 0.84 0.16 0.14 5.39*** 0.02 0.84 0.21 0.19 7.55*** DV dependent variable, IV independent variable, B beta, SEB standard error of beta, b standardized beta, R2 coefﬁcient of determination. *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001. Aggregate CSR and ﬁrm performance An increase in the aggregate CSR boosts ﬁrm per- formance. CSR-related beneﬁts may arise due to two reasons. First, the CSR-induced revenue can increase from enhanced sales and prices/margins. Second, the CSR-induced cost decrease can result from tax concessions, reductions of duties by the government to promote CSR activities, efﬁciency gains from environment-friendly technologies, and reduced cost of capital. A stakeholder-oriented ﬁrm while generating value for stakeholders also generates value for its shareholders. A favorable aggregate CSR towards all the primary stakeholders creates a ﬂeet of satisﬁed stakeholders who bring in efﬁciency gains and cost advantages through various means that ultimately improve ﬁrm performance. Satisﬁed employees reward the ﬁrm through pro- ductivity gains and reduced hiring and training costs, satisﬁed customers improve product sales through repeat purchase behavior, satisﬁed investors lend more capital at a cheaper rate decreasing cost of its satisﬁed communities capital, reduce the public relations cost, environmental stewardship leads to reputational advantages, and better suppliers reduce quality certiﬁcation costs. Findings establish that effective management of key stakeholders improves FP (Berman et al., 1999; Waddock and Graves, 1997). By being responsive to stakeholders, a ﬁrm also ensures superior performance compared to its competitors (Turban and Greening, 1997). When ﬁrms enhance CSR towards stakeholders, consumers not only like, respect, or admire the ﬁrms but also identify with it. Such identiﬁcation becomes so strong and enduring (Sen and Bhattacharya, 2001) that consumers become brand ambassadors of the ﬁrms (Springer, 2006) with long-lasting loyalty (Gillentine, 2006). their CSR towards employees and ﬁrm performance Past research establishes the importance of primary stakeholders as value drivers of a ﬁrm’s performance 588 Supriti Mishra and Damodar Suar (Barney and Hansen, 1994; Clarkson, 1995; Fom- burn and Shanley, 1990). A direct link between CSR towards employees and ﬁrm performance substantiates previous ﬁndings (Berman et al., 1999). Higher CSR towards employees in terms of employee-sensitive policies and practices by ﬁrms en- hances employee productivity, reduces absenteeism, and facilitates recruitment and retention of better quality employees (Turban and Greening, 1997). Attention on progressive human resource manage- ment practices, including training and development of employees, their participation in problem solving, progressive remuneration policies, and grievance handling reduces the attrition rate, increases employee productivity and FP (Huselid, 1995; Youndt et al., 1996). Lower attrition rates lead to lesser personnel hiring costs that ultimately improve ﬁrm performance. Corroborating past ﬁndings (Leff, 2004), the study ﬁnds that concern for employees is a part of core activities of Indian companies that improves ﬁrm performance. Indian companies have successfully integrated various CSR issues related to employees such as workplace safety and beneﬁt plans into the companies’ functions that ultimately reward them by enhancing their proﬁtability and competitive position. Better corporate consciousness on these issues and positive inﬂuence of CSR towards employees on ﬁrm performance may be attributed to the presence of empowered trade unions and strong labor laws in India, particularly in case of manufacturing companies. CSR towards customers and ﬁrm performance A favorable CSR towards customers enhances ﬁrm proﬁtability and NFP. This is congruent with previ- ous ﬁndings that ﬁrms gain by adding socially responsible elements to products (Berman et al., 1999; Bromiley and Marcus, 1989; Davidson and Worell, 1988). Ceteris paribus, customers are more likely to buy from companies that engage in CSR activities that they ﬁnd appropriate and personally relevant (Brown and Dacin, 1997; Sen et al., 2006). Cus- tomers reward companies that produce reliable and better quality products, and adhere to safety standards which improve FP (Berman et al., 1999; Graaﬂand and van de Ven, 2006). Company policies and prac- tices towards issues such as ethical advertising and pricing or providing products to the economic dis- advantaged induce a ‘feel good factor’ among the customers. They feel happy and proud to be identiﬁed with such companies. Such identiﬁcation (Sen and Bhattacharya, 2001) elicits repeat purchase behavior and ushers in competitive advantage for the ﬁrm. Alternatively, customers boycott companies who mislead them. An independent survey by GMI Poll (2005) ﬁnds that Nestle´ is one of the most widely boycotted companies in the world for its unethical promotion of baby foods and infant formulas. Com- panies such as Nestle´ India, Johnson and Johnson, and Wockhardt that sell baby foods are being prosecuted in India for giving misleading and scientiﬁcally feeding in their incorrect advertisements and promotion materials (Gupta, 2005). Boycotting of a company’s products and agi- tations and legal actions against the company jeopar- dize its image and adversely affect ﬁrm performance (Berman et al., 1999; Financial Express, 2006). information on infant CSR towards investors and ﬁrm performance Past research has established that better governance standards of companies lead to enhanced proﬁtability (Black and Khanna, 2007; Business Week, 2002). Better corporate governance practices by ﬁrms have favorable impact on FP indicators such as economic value added and market value added (Coles et al., 2001). Commitment of the management towards strong controls emphasizing ethical and social respon- sible behavior improves proﬁtability (Verschoor, 1998) and acts as a source of competitive advantage for ﬁrms. Stakeholders have increased conﬁdence on such ﬁrms. Investors pay a premium to buy the stocks of well-governed ﬁrms (Coombes and Watson, 2000). They even become willing to provide further capital to such ﬁrms at a lower rate of interest which reduces the cost of capital. Such factors enhance ﬁrm value and performance. Indian companies have to comply with various mandatory governance stan- dards laid down in the Clause 49 of the Listing Agreements, 2005 which is implemented by SEBI. Companies that fail to comply with the standards have the risk of getting delisted from Indian stock exchanges. This has made many Indian companies proactive in adopting corporate governance stan- dards. Moreover, success of companies such as Infosys due to adoption of better corporate governance CSR and Firm Performance 589 standards has motivated many other Indian ﬁrms to display similar practices and reap beneﬁts of good governance (CLSA, 2000). CSR towards community and ﬁrm performance Qualitative research on CSR using case studies establishes a favorable relation between community initiatives of ﬁrms and improved ﬁrm performance (Brugmann and Prahalad, 2007; Rockefeller, 2003) though empirical research (Berman et al., 1999) does not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relation between the two constructs. Findings of this study corroborate the ﬁndings of the qualitative research. A recent survey on business–community relations in India shows that 85% of the surveyed ﬁrms agree that they have a responsibility to the surrounding community and are committed towards their cause (Mahajan, 2004). A socially responsible image of companies among the local community improves the brand and loyalty of consumers. Consumers reward good corporate citi- zens through greater and sustained patronage (Luo and Bhattacharya, 2006). Positive CSR of compa- nies enhances overall product evaluation by con- sumers (Brown and Dacin, 1997). Consumers pay attention to the CSR records of the companies, encompassing mainly their community initiatives, while purchasing (Gildea, 1994; Owen and Scherer, 1993). Good corporate citizens can also reduce costs through indirect beneﬁts such as tax advantages, improved quality of local labor, and fewer lawsuits from employees and environmentalists (Ullman, 1985; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Section 80G of the Income Tax Act in India grants tax beneﬁts to Indian companies that invest on community devel- opment projects. Investment in such projects in association with the local government and NGOs improves image while reducing its expenses on tax payments. The ﬁrm faces less resis- tance from the local community and the govern- ment while pursuing its activities. The Tata group, which is well known as the most respected corporate citizen in India, provides the cheapest car in the world to the burgeoning cash-starving middle- income Indian families through its ‘Nano’ project. This project has received support from local gov- ernments and community in many Indian states due to the company’s reputation of corporate citizenship. the ﬁrm’s CSR towards environment and ﬁrm performance systems Investment A favorable CSR towards environment increasing FP and NFP of ﬁrms supports past ﬁndings (Ahmed et al., 1998; Alvarez et al., 2001). Environmentally compatible products, processes and management systems enhance proﬁtability either through revenue gains or through cost savings. Revenues increase as consumers prefer products of environmen- tally proactive companies (Owen and Scherer, 1993; Rosewicz, 1990). in environmental reduces costs arising from management environmental crisis, wastages of raw materials, and inefﬁcient production processes (Allen, 1992; Schmidheiny, 1992). Market values of ﬁrms signif- icantly increase when they adopt environmentally proactive stands or receive environmental awards (Klassen and Mc Laughlin, 1996). Adoption of superior environmental standards not only prepares ﬁrms to handle stricter regulations in the future but also positions them ahead of competitors (Barrett, 1992). Mainly four factors can be attributed to the environmental proactivity of Indian companies. First, there is a separate ministry under the Indian government, the ministry of environment and for- est, which monitors and enforces environmental quality standards through pollution control boards. Companies are required to adhere to mandatory standards speciﬁed in over 180 enactments related to environmental and industrial pollution such as the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1981, the Air (Preven- tion and Control of Pollution) Act, 1986, and the Environment (Prevention) Act, 1986. Second, since 1994, environmental management plans have been made mandatory for setting up new business units, and expansion or modernization of existing units. Third, past industrial disasters like the ‘Bhopal Gas tragedy’ in 1984 have raised environmental con- sciousness of Indian companies. Fourth, adoption of voluntary environmental standards has become a prerequisite to compete in the global market. Such factors have prompted Indian companies to include environmental management practices as a part of their core activities (Leff, 2004). Among the 150 studied ﬁrms, 92% have clearance from pollution control boards, which is mandatory. In addition, 43% have adopted ISO 14000 and 15% have adopted OHSAS 18000. Such proactivity enhances ﬁrm performance. 590 Supriti Mishra and Damodar Suar CSR towards suppliers and ﬁrm performance The demand for social audit by international buyers and multi-national business associates from devel- oped countries has made it necessary for companies in emerging markets like India to ensure responsible and ethical practices at locations. By ensuring ethical practices at locations, companies increase their competitiveness and image in the global market that improves ﬁrm performance. The ﬁndings of the study concur that favorable CSR towards suppliers can be a deﬁnite source of com- petitive advantage and bring higher returns. suppliers’ suppliers’ Limitations Issues There are certain limitations of the study that must be acknowledged. First, the data on CSR and NFP are perceptual in nature. Respondents might have overemphasized the positive aspects of CSR as well as NFP of their ﬁrms and understated corresponding negative aspects. Notwithstanding the limitations, a priori model is assumed for the items measuring each construct of CSR and ascertained applying CFA that arrests the common method variance sta- tistically. Moreover, because the data on FP and sources, CSR are collected from two different common method variance in the results is also arrested procedurally (Podsakoff et al., 2003). Sec- ond, the data are collected from 18 categories of industries. faced by each category being unique and different from one another, an aggregate analysis across multiple categories of industries might have missed industry-speciﬁc issues (Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997). However, CSR issues included in the study are generic in nature. For example, product quality and price, safety standards in the work place, community partnership, or stronger governance standards represent responsible business practices across industries. Third, the proposed CSR measure may be a narrow conceptualization of CSR as it assesses a ﬁrm’s social policies and practices towards primary stakeholders. The measure can be strengthened by incorporating actionable outcomes. For example, items like policies and practices to- wards ‘training and development of women and minorities’ or ‘sexual harassment prohibition’ can be matched with corresponding actionable outcomes about the actual number of training programs pro- vided to women and minorities or the redressal of actual number of sexual harassment cases. Lastly, because data are collected from only 18 categories of manufacturing industries in India, caution must be exercised in generalizing the ﬁndings. Implications and future research direction research adds a ‘stakeholder-sense’ Corporate social responsibility (policy, program, or process) is ‘strategic’ when it yields substantial busi- ness-related beneﬁts to the ﬁrm (Burke and Logsdon, 1996). This approach towards CSR has been criti- cized by researchers for a lack of intrinsic and moral grounding (Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Vogel, 2005). They argue that such an approach reduces CSR to a marketing instrument (Maignan and Ferrell, 2001) and turns stakeholders as ‘means’ to the ‘ends’ of maximizing shareholder wealth (Goodpaster, 1998). This to the ‘business-sense’ of CSR. By designing stakeholder- sensitive policies, ﬁrms cater to a wide range of issues relevant to stakeholders. Many issues included in the proposed CSR framework do not have a direct link with proﬁtability. For example, indicators such as ethical advertising, diversity, policies towards insider trading, or policies to eliminate human rights’ abuses at the work place and supplier locations do not have any direct ﬁnancial implications. Rather these factors bring ethical issues into the CSR discussion. In this sense, this study addresses the concern about lack of ethical dimensions in CSR research. By bringing stakeholder-sensitive and ethical issues into the CSR framework, it advocates such an approach can be beneﬁcial for both the ﬁrm and its stakeholders, and lead to a win-win situation for both. This study contributes to the empirical literature of CSR in three ways. First, when the study was carried out in 2005, no systematic database on CSR was available for evaluating Indian companies from the stakeholders’ perspective. Though there are few recent attempts to rate CSR activities of Indian companies, like the Karmayog CSR rating (India- PRwire.com, 2007), an objective assessment of CSR like that done by KLD in the US is still not found in India. We have developed and validated an instru- ment to assess CSR from the stakeholders’ per- spective in the Indian context that can be used in CSR and Firm Performance 591 future investigations. Second, past studies (Cochran and Wood, 1984; Ruf et al., 2001; Waddock and Graves, 1997) have used aggregate CSR measures from secondary sources due to the availability of such data. This study has considered a segregated form of CSR in addition to the aggregated form in the analysis by collecting primary data on individual CSR dimensions of ﬁrms. A segregated analysis of CSR points out critical issues embedded in speciﬁc stakeholders and the inﬂuence of such issues on ﬁrm performance, which cannot be captured by carrying out an aggregated analysis alone. Capturing such issues are important because, inﬂuenced by a higher level of aggregate CSR, companies may overlook speciﬁc stakeholder issues which might have critical bearing on ﬁrm performance. Third, few studies have reported the positive impact of environmental proactivity on NFP (Ahmed et al., 1998; Benito and Benito, 2005) but not in the context of other stakeholders. This study reveals the direct inﬂuence of CSR towards six primary stakeholder groups including environment on NFP as well as on FP. Convergence of results from the two analyses, one using FP and the other using NFP, strengthens the link (Bouchard, 1976) between CSR and ﬁrm per- formance. Contrary to negative relationships found in few past studies (Davidson and Worell, 1988; Davidson et al., 1987), this study establishes positive relationships between the aggregate and segregate dimensions of CSR and ﬁrm performance. The negative results of past studies are mostly attributed to the use of volatile market-based measures such as stock returns (Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997). Because this study has used a more consistent accounting measure of ROA, the results concur with past positive evidences on CSR inﬂuencing ﬁrm per- formance (Graves and Waddock, 1994; Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997; McGuire et al., 1988). Furthermore, it is important to account for the contribution of CSR towards the creation of intangible assets such as corporate reputation and image which are reﬂected in a ﬁrm’s NFP. This study reports CSR as a better predictor of NFP compared to FP. The aggregate and segregate dimensions of CSR are found to be the more potent contributors to creation of intan- gible assets such as employee satisfaction, customer relationships, and internal business process efﬁ- ciency, compared to the tangible ﬁnancial gains. that suggests stakeholder responsible business behaviors During the survey, it was found that many Indian executives had misconceptions about CSR. Many companies initially declined to participate in the survey on the ground that they did not have a CSR department or did not undertake any CSR activity. Like a recent survey which ﬁnds that CSR activities of many Indian companies are mainly handled by public relations or human resources department ra- ther than a CSR department (Sagar and Singla, 2004), our survey also ﬁnds that 90% of the surveyed companies have neither an exclusive department nor a speciﬁc budget for CSR. Moreover, surveyed managers equated CSR with philanthropic activities such as conducting health awareness programs, plantation activities, and donating for charity or socio-cultural activities. They participated in the survey when it was explained that a proper assess- ment of CSR goes beyond philanthropy and includes towards though Indian stakeholders. This companies adopt sensitive policies and practices, they are not aware that such activities could be called CSR. This study can be an eye- for broadening opener their understanding of CSR that the stakeholder map. Moreover, this study addresses the concern of Indian businessmen who do not adopt a long-term CSR policy due to its lack of provable link with proﬁtability (British Council et al., 2002). The present ﬁndings may translate into higher number of Indian companies engaging in mean- ingful CSR activities emphasizing stakeholder relations. The study is conducted in the manufac- turing sector. Future study may be carried out for speciﬁc industry categories even within the manu- facturing industry such as automobile, chemical, and the like to bring out industry speciﬁc issues. Future research may also deal with CSR issues in the service sector and the small and medium enterprises which are growing at a faster rate in India. This study has not considered the inﬂuence of price on CSR strategy. Studying consumers’ reactions when CSR costs are added to the price of a product can be a potential area of research in the context of the price sensitive Indian consumers. Inﬂuence of Indian values and leadership style on the managerial approach towards CSR can also be investigated. for Indian executives includes 592 Notes 1 Kisan Kendra is the Hindi name for ‘farmer centre’. 2 English meaning of Subh Labh is ‘auspicious proﬁt’, a word often used by Indian business men.
