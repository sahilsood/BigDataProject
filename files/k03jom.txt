Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 The relationship between total quality management practices and their effects on ﬁrm performance ∗ Hale Kaynak Department of Management, Marketing, and International Business, College of Business Administration, The University of Texas—Pan American, 1201 West University Drive, Edinburg, TX 78539-2999, USA Received 6 June 2000; accepted 10 November 2002 Abstract Recent research on total quality management (TQM) has examined the relationships between the practices of quality management and various levels of organizational performance. These studies have produced mixed results, probably because of the nature of the research designs used such as measuring TQM or performance as a single construct. Based on a comprehensive literature review, this study identiﬁes the relationships among TQM practices and examines the direct and indirect effects of these practices on various performance levels. A proposed research model and hypotheses are tested by using cross-sectional mail survey data collected from ﬁrms operating in the US. The test of the structural model supports the proposed hypotheses. The implications of the ﬁndings for researchers and practitioners are discussed and further research directions are offered. © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

He crowed every morning, putting forth all his energy, ﬂapped his wings. The sun came up. The connex- ion was clear: His crowing caused the sun to come up. There was no question about his importance. There came a snag. He forgot one morning to crow. The sun came up anyhow. Crestfallen, he saw his theory in need of revision. (Deming, 1993, p. 105) In the late 1970s and early 1980s, previously un- challenged American industries lost substantial mar- ket share in both US and world markets.

Kaynak). the competitive edge, companies began to adopt pro- ductivity improvement programs which had proven themselves particularly successful in Japan. One of these “improvement programs” was the total quality management (TQM) system. In last two decades, both the popular press and academic journals have pub- lished a plethora of accounts describing both success- ful and unsuccessful efforts at implementing TQM. Like Chanticleer’s theory, theories of quality manage- ment have been under revision ever since. The early stages of empirical research in TQM have been almost exclusively limited to attempts at constructing instruments capable of measuring TQM practices as, for example, Saraph et al. (1989) have done, and with studies such as Garvin’s (1983) that compare TQM practices in Japanese and US ﬁrms. More recently, scholars like Mohrman et al. (1995) have channeled their research efforts into analyzing 0272-6963/03/$ – see front matter © 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/S0272-6963(03)00004-4 406 H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 the relationship between practices of quality manage- ment and organizational performance on various lev- els. Recent studies such as the one conducted by Das et al. (2000) have started investigating both the rela- tionships among techniques of quality management systems and the effects they have on performance. These studies have produced mixed results. This failure to obtain consistent results could be due to three signiﬁcant differences among studies in terms of research design issues. First, in some studies such as the one conducted by Douglas and Judge (2001), TQM is operationalized as a single construct to ana- lyze the relationship between TQM and ﬁrms’ perfor- mance, while others, Samson and Terziovski (1999) for instance, operationalize TQM as a multidimen- sional construct. Second, the levels of performance measured vary among the studies. Some studies op- erationalize performance only at operating levels as Samson and Terziovski (1999) do, while others like Douglas and Judge (2001) measure only ﬁnancial performance; and still others as do Das et al. (2000), measure performance at multiple levels. Third, the analytical framework used to investigate the relation between TQM and performance also differs among the studies. In other words, when the data analyses are based on a series of multiple regressions (Adam et al., 1997; Mohrman et al., 1995; Samson and Terziovski, 1999) or correlations (Powell, 1995), the studies fall short of investigating which TQM prac- tices have direct and/or indirect effects on various levels of performance. In short, comprehensive stud- ies trying to identify the direct and indirect effects of TQM practices on performance at multiple levels are rather limited and fail to respond conclusively to the following research questions: • What are the relationships among TQM practices? • Which TQM practices are directly related to oper- • Which TQM practices are indirectly related to op- ating, market and ﬁnancial performance? erating, market and ﬁnancial performance? This study investigates these research questions by using the data from Kaynak’s (1997) study. This re- search contributes to the development of TQM theory by investigating the relationships between seven qual- ity management practices and their effects on oper- ating, ﬁnancial, and market performance. While this study does replicate some earlier research, it is unique in that the dimensions of the quality management prac- tices investigated are extensive and ﬁrms’ performance is measured at multiple levels. Replication research fa- cilitates the goal of science, which is empirical gener- alization or knowledge development (Hubbard et al., 1998), and it is recommended in cases such as this “where different studies produced inconsistent results” (Amundson, 1998, p. 355). This research is relevant to practitioners because the ﬁndings may reveal patterns in the implementation of TQM practices, which may provide signiﬁcant information managers can use to solve implementation challenges and perhaps to im- prove performance. Moreover, the results of this study may provide support for continued implementation of TQM. The unsuccessful attempts have prompted crit- icisms of TQM in the popular press and caused some managers who might otherwise have had an interest in implementing TQM to question the wisdom of uti- lizing this management approach. But this, to quote an old but still relevant cliché, is throwing out the baby with the bath water. The remainder of this pa- per is organized as follows. A research model and re- lated hypotheses are offered based on the review of the literature in the next section. Section 3 describes the research methodology, including the construction of the instrument and measures, the survey procedure, the sample, and the tests for reliability and validity. Section 4 presents the results of testing the structural model. The implications of the results for researchers and practitioners are discussed and validity of ﬁndings is reevaluated in Section 5. The paper concludes with further research implications of this study. 2. Theoretical background TQM can be deﬁned as a holistic management phi- losophy that strives for continuous improvement in all functions of an organization, and it can be achieved only if the total quality concept is utilized from the acquisition of resources to customer service after the sale. TQM practices have been documented exten- sively in measurement studies as well as in the studies that have investigated the relation of TQM practices to various dependent variables. The TQM practices iden- tiﬁed in measurement studies by Saraph et al. (1989) and those who have followed their example are sum- marized in Table 1. Table 1 TQM Practices identiﬁed in measurement studies on TQM Saraph et al. (1989) Description by Saraph et al.

Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 409 A close examination of Table 1 shows that each instrument has some limitations and some strengths. As a part of her research, Kaynak (1997) used Saraph et al.’s (1989) survey instrument for most of the items to assess the implementation of TQM in 382 man- ufacturing and service ﬁrms operating in the United States because the nature of her study was closer to that of Saraph et al. (1989) than it was to the other TQM measurement studies available. The re- sults of reliability tests and factor analysis showed the same pattern Saraph et al. (1989) found in their study. (The instrument will be discussed further in Section 3.) Because the data from Kaynak’s (1997) study are used in this study, the seven TQM techniques investigated here are the same as in Saraph et al.’s (1989) study: management leadership, training, em- ployee relations, quality data and reporting, supplier quality management, product/service design, and pro- cess management. These techniques are described in Table 1. The scale of Role of the Quality Department is not included in this study because 105 organiza- tions of the 382 did not have a quality department. The summary of studies on the relationship between TQM techniques and ﬁrms’ performance is presented in Table 2. A review of TQM techniques investigated in these studies shows that the seven techniques of TQM used in this study represent a wide domain of TQM. Based on the strategic management, market- ing, and operations management literature, Kaynak (1997) identiﬁed and validated three dimensions of ﬁrms’ performance relevant to TQM. Financial and market performance indicators include return on investment (ROI), sales growth, proﬁt growth, market share, and market share growth. The indi- cators for quality performance are product/service quality, productivity, cost of scrap and rework, de- livery lead-time of purchased materials, and delivery lead-time of ﬁnished products/services to customers. Two indicators of inventory management perfor- mance are purchased material turnover and total inventory turnover. The same three dimensions of ﬁrms’ performance Kaynak (1997) used in her pre- vious study are used in this study, and these are consistent with the measurement of performance in the other studies on the relationship between quality management and ﬁrm performance, as presented in Table 2. 2.1. The research model and proposed hypotheses Because of the inconsistent results, the main ﬁnd- ings of the studies summarized in Table 2 do not really provide a plausible research model for identifying the direct and indirect effects of TQM practices on the di- mensions of performance, though, as Mohrman et al. (1995) remind us, “Most of the TQM practices are re- lated to one form of performance improvement or the other” (p. 39). However, the ﬁndings of the studies in which TQM has been operationalized as a multidi- mensional construct and in which indirect and direct effects of TQM practices on performance are investi- gated (e.g. Das et al., 2000; Flynn et al., 1995; Ho et al., 2001) indicate that the infrastructural TQM practices such as top management leadership, training, and em- ployee relations affect performance through core TQM practices such as quality data and reporting, supplier quality management, product/service design, and pro- cess management. Given the limited amount of literature on the re- search questions investigated in this study, the hy- potheses pertaining to the relationships suggested in the research model (see Fig. 1) are drawn from studies in the literature on organizational change and opera- tions management in addition to quality management literature. Each path in Fig. 1 is labeled with the asso- ciated hypothesis, and all are discussed in the follow- ing sections. 2.1.1. Management leadership As documented by quality gurus (e.g. Deming, 1986; Juran, 1986), and the studies summarized in Tables 1 and 2, management leadership is an important factor in TQM implementation because it improves performance by inﬂuencing other TQM practices (Ahire and O’Shaughnessy, 1998; Anderson et al., 1995; Flynn et al., 1995; Wilson and Collier, 2000). Successful implementation of TQM requires effective change in an organization’s culture, and it is almost impossible to change an organization without a con- centrated effort by management aimed at continuous improvement, open communication, and cooperation throughout the value chain (Abraham et al., 1999; Adebanjo and Kehoe, 1999; Bell and Burnham, 1989; Choi, 1995; Daft, 1998; Ettkin et al., 1990; Goodstein and Burke, 1991; Hamlin et al., 1997; Handﬁeld and Ghosh, 1994; Ho et al., 1999; Zeitz et al., 1997). Table 2 Summary of studies on the relationship between total quality management (TQM) and ﬁrms’ performance Study Operationalization of TQM Sources of performance data and measurement level Operational deﬁnition of performance Secondary perceived performance (subjective) Operating performance Customer satisfaction Perceived relative performance (subjective) and primary objective data Operating performance Secondary data sources, perceived performance (subjective) Financial performance Market performance Operating performance Quality market outcomes, percent-passed ﬁnal inspection with no rework, competitive advantage (unit cost, fast delivery, volume ﬂexibility, inventory turnover, cycle time) ROE, ROI, ROS, ROA, perceived proﬁtability and competitiveness Market share Cost of manufacturing, inventory turnover, perceived productivity, customer satisfaction, quality and speed Anderson et al.

(1995) Path analysis Questionnaire Multiple regression analyses, hierarchical regression analyses Main ﬁndings Employee fulﬁllment has a signiﬁcant direct effect on customer satisfaction. No signiﬁcant relationship exists between continuous improvement and customer satisfaction. Statistical control/feedback and the product design process have positive effects on perceived quality market outcomes while the process ﬂow management and statistical control/feedback are signiﬁcantly related to internal measure of the percent that passed ﬁnal inspection without requiring rework. Both perceived quality market outcomes and percent-passed ﬁnal inspection with no rework have signiﬁcant effects on competitive advantage. There is a signiﬁcant and positive relation between the extent of TQM adoption and efﬁciency of employee and capital utilization. The relationship of TQM to manufacturing costs and inventory turnover is not signiﬁcant. Although core TQM practices and market share are signiﬁcantly related for manufacturing ﬁrms, no signiﬁcant relationships are found between TQM adoption and ﬁnancial performance. 4 1 0 H .

A zero-defects mentality and closeness to suppliers correlate signiﬁcantly with TQM performance, but with total performance only marginally.

Employee knowledge about quality improvement, what quality customers receive and perceive, employee compensation and recognition and management involvement are signiﬁcantly and inversely correlated with total cost of quality and average per cent of items defective. Financial performance is positively correlated with senior management involvement and employee compensation and recognition. The relation between TQM and performance is stronger when manufacturing performance measures are used as a part of managerial evaluation. H .

Customer focus has a signiﬁcant effect on product/service quality. Employee fulﬁllment, cooperation and customer focus positively impact customer satisfaction. TQM practices have a stronger effect on customer satisfaction than they do on plant performance. The plant performance has no signiﬁcant effect on customer satisfaction. Firms with high top management commitment produce higher quality products than those with low top management commitment. Customer focus, supplier quality management and empowerment emerge as signiﬁcant predictors of product quality. For the ﬁrms adopting TQM, ﬁnancial performance has increased. 4 1 2 H .

Theoretical model of the relationship between TQM practices and performance measures. Management has a complex leadership role when implementing TQM. It is impossible to improve any organization’s operations without a well-trained work- force. It is management that provides the resources necessary for training employees in the use of new principles and tools, and creates a work environment conducive to employee involvement in the process of change (Ahire and O’Shaughnessy, 1998; Anderson et al., 1995; Bell and Burnham, 1989; Burack et al., 1994; Daft, 1998; Flynn et al., 1995; Hamlin et al., 1997; Handﬁeld et al., 1998; Ho et al., 1999; Schroeder et al., 1989; Wilson and Collier, 2000). And top man- agement must ensure that the necessary resources for quality-related training are available (Ahire and O’Shaughnessy, 1998; Anderson et al., 1995; Flynn et al., 1995; Handﬁeld et al., 1998; Ho et al., 1999). But it takes more than training to guarantee efﬁcient and successful change. Employees must be involved in the process of change, a crucial factor according to Adebanjo and Kehoe (1999), and this involvement is effected by creating a work environment that en- courages and facilitates open communication. In such an environment, workers are apt to work harder and contribute ideas that both facilitate and enhance the change process (Anderson et al., 1995; Burack et al., 1994; Das et al., 2000; Flynn et al., 1995; Handﬁeld et al., 1998; Spector and Beer, 1994). Involving em- ployees requires communicating a clear strategy for improving quality to them, and this function can be enhanced by instituting quality-based incentive and compensation procedures (Bonito, 1990; Flynn et al., 1995). Thus, the literature discussed above leads to the following hypotheses: H1a. Management leadership is positively related to training. H1b. Management leadership is positively related to employee relations. H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 415 Effective leadership is also critical to effecting organizational changes—especially in purchasing— that improve interactions with supply chain members (Cooper and Ellram, 1993). To promote mutually beneﬁcial relations with suppliers, management can, and probably should, privilege quality and delivery performance over price when selecting suppliers and certifying suppliers for material quality (Flynn et al., 1995; Trent and Monczka, 1999). Managing supplier relationships strategically is essential to the success of organization–supplier relationships because these partnerships require both a high level of commitment and an exchange of proprietary and competitive infor- mation (Ellram, 1991). Consequently, the following hypothesis is proposed: H1c. Management leadership is positively related to supplier quality management. Last, but not the least, management must be re- sponsible for focusing product design on market and consumer needs (Deming, 1986; Flynn et al., 1995; Garvin, 1987; Shetty, 1988). This sharp focus is crucial to developing products that are manufacturable and meet the needs of the customers (Flynn et al., 1995; Hackman and Wageman, 1995; Juran, 1981; Leonard and Sasser, 1982). Thus, we are led to the following hypothesis: H1d. Management leadership is positively related to product design. 2.1.2. Training In the literature (e.g. Bell and Burnham, 1989; Choi, 1995; Daft, 1998; Ettkin et al., 1990), employee training is clearly identiﬁed as a critical component of workforce management when implementing signiﬁ- cant changes in an organization. If it is to be effective, i.e. transform employees into creative problem solvers, training in quality-related issues should emphasize problem solving in small groups, effective commu- nication, and statistical process control (Flynn et al., 1994). Workforce training in the techniques necessary for improving processes must be continuous if the improvement effort is to be sustained, for an ongoing training program will help employees discover inno- vative ways to improve the organization (Choi, 1995) and shoulder more of the responsibility for effecting improvements (Adebanjo and Kehoe, 1999; Ho et al., 1999). The authors of several studies (Bonito, 1990; Daft, 1998; Easton and Jarrell, 1998; Forza and Flippini, 1998; Hackman and Wageman, 1995; Holpp, 1994) argue forcefully that the number of skills em- ployees need to be productive workers is correlated positively with the level of engagement employees have with their jobs. It would seem reasonable, then, to expect that an increase in training will produce a corresponding increase in employee involvement with their jobs and in increased awareness of quality-related issues. Thus, we have the following hypothesis: H2a. Training is positively related to employee rela- tions. To manage quality, employees must effectively measure and make use of quality data in a timely manner, and to do this they need to be trained in the use of quality improvement tools (Ahire and Dreyfus, 2000; Ho et al., 1999). Training and employee rela- tions (the latter is discussed in the following section) has a positive effect on quality, which is mediated through quality data and reporting (Ho et al., 2001). Collecting and using quality data are impossible with- out training, but training alone will not sustain an improvement effort: employees must receive quality data in a timely manner and use it effectively. Thus, the following hypothesis is suggested: H2b. Training is positively related to quality data and reporting. 2.1.3. Employee relations The employee relations investigated in this study en- compass a variety of organizational development (OD) techniques to facilitate changes such as employee participation in decisions (Bell and Burnham, 1989; Burack et al., 1994; Choi, 1995; Daft, 1998; Ford and Fottler, 1995; Holpp, 1994), employee recognition (Daft, 1998; Ford and Fottler, 1995), teamwork (Bell and Burnham, 1989; Daft, 1998; Ford and Fottler, 1995; Holpp, 1994), and the use of effective com- munications to create an awareness of organizational goals (Bell and Burnham, 1989; Daft, 1998; Ford and Fottler, 1995). These OD techniques, generally considered the most relevant human resource prac- tices in organizations that make effective use of TQM 416 H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 techniques, are identiﬁed by the studies summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Empirical results also support the assertion that em- ployee relations are directly related to quality data and reporting (Flynn et al., 1995; Ho et al., 1999, 2001). This result is not surprising because effective mea- surement, availability, and use of quality data require continuous awareness of quality-related issues in em- ployees who have a signiﬁcant role in quality deci- sions. Generally speaking, these decisions contribute to improvement only when they are based on accurate quality data (Ho et al., 1999). Thus, we can suggest the following hypothesis: H3. Employee relations is positively related to quality data and reporting. 2.1.4. Quality data and reporting Quality data and reporting involve using costs of poor quality such as rework, scrap and warranty costs, and control charts to identify quality problems and provide information on areas of possible improvement (Choi, 1995; Ho et al., 1999; Lockamy, 1998). The positive effect of quality data and reporting on ﬁrm performance is through three other TQM techniques: supplier quality management, product/service design, and process management. Managing supplier quality entails monitoring and assessing the performance of suppliers through the creation of a supplier performance measurement database, a tool crucial to enhancing material quality, reducing development costs, purchase prices, and im- proving supplier responsiveness (Krause et al., 1998). With this database companies can accurately track such quality measures as parts-per-million defective, reliability, process capability ratios, and percent parts rejected (Forza and Flippini, 1998; Krause et al., 1998; Trent and Monczka, 1999) as well as on-time delivery performance and percent of incoming ma- terials acceptable (Tan et al., 1998). In conjunction with supplier performance databases, availability, costs of quality, and control charts help employees and managers identify and solve problems stemming from supplied materials and parts. Suppliers can be provided the information they need to improve their performance (Adebanjo and Kehoe, 1999). Thus, we can propose the following hypothesis: H4a. Quality data and reporting is positively related to supplier quality management. Companies implementing TQM emphasize building quality into the product rather than inspecting quality into the ﬁnished product and removing defective prod- ucts (Ahire and O’Shaughnessy, 1998; Flynn et al., 1995; Handﬁeld et al., 1999; Tan, 2001). Because product design requires such a wide range of informa- tion, design teams are comprised of people from pur- chasing, design, production, suppliers and customers (Flynn et al., 1995; Lockamy, 1998). Design manage- ment tools—design for manufacturability, concurrent engineering, quality function deployment, and design for experiments (Ahire and Dreyfus, 2000; Easton and Jarrell, 1998; Handﬁeld et al., 1999; Ho et al., 1999)— can be used effectively only if quality data are col- lected and disseminated throughout the organization in a timely manner. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed: H4b. Quality data and reporting is positively related to product/service design. Quality data directly affect process management by informing workers about changes in processes immediately so they can take corrective actions be- fore defective products are produced and then check the results of their improvement efforts (Flynn et al., 1995; Ho et al., 1999). The effectiveness of using sta- tistical process control charts and process capability studies in process improvement is well established in the literature (Ahire and O’Shaughnessy, 1998; Flynn et al., 1995; Handﬁeld et al., 1999). Therefore, we can propose the following hypothesis: H4c. Quality data and reporting is positively related to process management. 2.1.5. Supplier quality management Effective supplier quality management is facilitated by long-term, cooperative relationships with as few suppliers as possible to obtain quality materials and/or services. Maintaining a small number of suppliers im- proves product quality and productivity of buyers by encouraging enhanced supplier commitment to prod- uct design and quality (Ansari and Modarress, 1990; Burt, 1989; Trent and Monczka, 1999). Additionally, H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 417 dealing with a small number of suppliers facilitates the solution of quality and delivery problems because buyers can pay close attention to each supplier (Burt, 1989; Cooper and Ellram, 1993). Successful relation- ships encourage suppliers to become involved in the buying ﬁrm’s design of products/services, and gives them a chance to offer suggestions regarding product and/or component simpliﬁcation. They can also help purchasers procure the materials and parts that can be used most efﬁciently (Burt, 1989; Flynn et al., 1995; Forza and Flippini, 1998; Shin et al., 2000; Tan, 2001; Trent and Monczka, 1999). Thus, we can offer the fol- lowing hypothesis: H5a. Supplier quality management is positively re- lated to product/service design. A number of researchers have found that improved supplier relations enhance the performance of both suppliers and buyers, and this is especially true when quality and delivery are buyer priorities (Flynn et al., 1995; Ho et al., 1999; Shin et al., 2000). The produc- tion of quality products is necessarily dependent on the timely delivery of quality materials, so it is essen- tial that materials supplied meet the buyer’s speciﬁ- cations and standards for quality (Flynn et al., 1995; Forza and Flippini, 1998; Grieco and Gozzo, 1985; Trent and Monczka, 1999). Improving the quality of purchased materials and parts, a main source of pro- cess variability, will have a positive effect on process management (Flynn et al., 1995) by eliminating vari- ance in materials and parts, which makes it possible to utilize internal controls over such other variables as machinery and the workforce (Forza and Flippini, 1998). Thus, we are led to the following hypothesis: that successful customer/supplier cooperation can result in inventory reduction beneﬁts for both parties. H5c. Supplier quality management is positively re- lated to inventory management performance. 2.1.6. Product/service design Under TQM systems, product/service design efforts have two objectives: designing manufacturable prod- ucts and designing quality into the products (Flynn et al., 1995; Handﬁeld et al., 1999). Designing to sim- plify manufacturing utilizes cross-functional teams to reduce the number of parts per product and standard- ize the parts (Chase et al., 2001), which results in more efﬁcient process management by reducing process complexity and process variance (Ahire and Dreyfus, 2000; Flynn et al., 1995). The same cross-functional team that designed the product can also focus on im- proving manufacturing processes (Ahire and Dreyfus, 2000). Thus, we offer the following hypothesis: H6a. Product design is positively related to process management. Using as few parts as possible and standardizing as many of these parts per product as is feasible speeds up the learning curve effect on employees, thereby en- hancing quality and reducing costs due to decreased variety and increased volume (Tan, 2001). As the num- ber of components decreases, the failure rate of a prod- uct also decreases and its reliability increases (Ahire and Dreyfus, 2000; Flynn et al., 1995). Quality prob- lems can be further reduced by including customers’ requirements in new product/service design reviews prior to production (Forza and Flippini, 1998). Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed: H5b. Supplier quality management is positively re- lated to process management. H6b. Product design is positively related to quality performance. A direct contribution effective supplier manage- ment makes to ﬁrm performance is inventory reduc- tion (Easton and Jarrell, 1998; Engelkemeyer, 1990; Levandoski, 1993; United States General Accounting Ofﬁce, 1991), which enables ﬁrms to sustain efforts to reduce waste, eliminate safety stocks, and create a leaner operation (Choi, 1995; Krajewski and Ritzman, 2001). A study by Chapman and Carter (1990) shows 2.1.7. Process management Process management entails taking a preventive approach to quality improvement such as designing processes that are fool-proof and that provide stable production schedules and work distribution (Flynn et al., 1995; Saraph et al., 1989) to reduce process variation (Flynn et al., 1995) by building quality into the product during the production stage (Handﬁeld 418 H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 et al., 1999). Reducing process variation should re- sult in increased output uniformity as well as reduced rework and waste (Anderson et al., 1994; Forza and Flippini, 1998) because quality problems are identi- ﬁed and corrected immediately (Ahire and Dreyfus, 2000). Regular preventive equipment maintenance positively contributes to product quality by improv- ing machine reliability and reducing interruptions in production (Ho et al., 1999). Flynn et al. (1995) found that effective process management results in an increased percent-passed ﬁnal inspection with no rework. This increased production quality leads to improved product quality and, in turn, other improve- ments in competitive priorities such as reduced costs and fast delivery. Additionally, the empirical ﬁndings by Ahire and Dreyfus (2000) and Forza and Flippini (1998) show that process management directly and positively affects product quality. Thus, the following hypothesis is offered: H7. Process management quality performance. is positively related to 2.1.8. Firm performance Companies implementing TQM experience high inventory turnover, a situation which enables the identiﬁcation of scheduling and production problems (Krajewski and Ritzman, 2001; Tan, 2001) and en- courages continuous improvement of processes and product quality (Adam et al., 1997). These improve- ments should result in lower scrap and rework costs as well as enhanced productivity and lead-time per- formance. Thus, we can expect that better inventory management will lead to increased quality perfor- mance. H8a. Inventory management performance is posi- tively related to quality performance. Quality performance improves ﬁnancial and market performance, and the literature offers several expla- nations for these effects. First, as a ﬁrm acquires a reputation for delivering high quality products and services, the elasticity of demand can decrease, which, in turn, can enable the ﬁrm to charge higher prices and earn higher proﬁts (Shetty, 1988). Second, improving product quality by reducing waste and improving ef- ﬁciency will increase the return on assets (Handﬁeld et al., 1998), which will increase proﬁtability. Third, reduced rework, less scrap, and improved productivity will lower the cost structure of a ﬁrm, which enables the ﬁrm to offer lower prices—if it is motivated to do so—for products and services without denting the proﬁt margin. Low prices can increase market share and sales (Deming, 1986; Maani et al., 1994; Reed et al., 1996). Last, improvements in quality will re- sult in more satisﬁed customers with greater loyalty, increased sales (Ahire and Dreyfus, 2000; Choi and Eboch, 1998; Handﬁeld et al., 1998; Hendricks and Singhal, 1997), and an enhanced competitive position (Aaker and Jacobson, 1994; Fornell et al., 1996). The beneﬁcial effect of product/service quality on mar- ket share (Buzzell et al., 1975; Craig and Douglas, 1982; Jacobson and Aaker, 1987; Phillips et al., 1983; Zeithaml and Fry, 1981) and proﬁt when measured as return on investment (Craig and Douglas, 1982; Jacobson and Aaker, 1987; MacMillan et al., 1982; Phillips et al., 1983; Zeithaml and Fry, 1981) is a consistent ﬁnding of research published in market- ing literature. Based on the reviewed literature, the following hypothesis is suggested: H8b. Quality performance is positively related to ﬁnancial and market performance. 3. Research methodology The data for this research were drawn from a cross-sectional mail study conducted to investigate TQM, just-in-time purchasing (JITP) and the perfor- mance of ﬁrms operating in the 48 contiguous states of the US that have implemented TQM and JITP tech- niques. Using data collected through cross-sectional mail survey methodology is appropriate because the research questions posed in this study lend themselves to investigating the relationships between multiple variables. A large sample size is required to obtain reliable and valid research results. Moreover, it is relatively inexpensive and has the greatest potential for reaching a large number of respondents widely dispersed (Alreck and Settle, 1985). Issues pertaining to the construction of the instrument and measures, the survey procedure, the sample, and the tests for reliability and exploratory factor analysis are brieﬂy reviewed in the following sections. The discussion of H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 419 tests for reliability and validity also includes the re- sults of the conﬁrmatory factor analysis performed in the current study in order to reﬁne the resulting scales in exploratory factor analysis and to establish unidi- mensionality, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the measures used in this study. 3.1. Construction of the instrument and measures Churchill’s (1979) work provided the basis for the construction of the instrument and measures utilized in this study. The domains of constructs were identiﬁed via a thorough review of the literature. For most of the items of the TQM construct, Saraph et al.’s (1989) sur- vey instrument was useful. Saraph et al. (1989) mea- sured the factors of supplier cooperation and materials quality as one factor: supplier quality management. The measurement of these factors in this study, how- ever, required a more in-depth examination. Therefore, to measure supplier cooperation and materials quality, the items pertaining to these two factors from Saraph et al.’s questionnaire were grouped based on content analysis. In addition, one item was adapted from Ettlie and Reza (1992) and the others were originated in the literature review. The list of scales, items, and their sources are presented in Appendix A. Saraph et al.’s (1989) instrument uses a discrete, Likert-type scale. This study favored the use of a continuous scale because, as research shows, as the number of scaling points decreases, the amount of information lost increases (Martin, 1978; McClelland and Judd, 1993; Russell and Bobko, 1992). There- fore, a continuous scale 100 mm long was utilized. The polar points pertaining to TQM practices were none = 0 and very high = 100. The use of continu- ous scales for research (e.g. Taylor et al., 1992) has become acceptable in the social sciences. The word- ing of some borrowed items was changed to adapt them to a continuous scale format. The items relating to performance variables were based on a review of the literature on strategic man- agement, marketing, and operations management (see Appendix A). Three levels of performance measures were identiﬁed: ﬁnancial, market, and operating. These performance measures are consistent with the performance measurement in the studies presented in Table 2. The values of the end poles measuring relative perceived performance are adapted from Venkatraman and Ramanujam (1987). We asked respondents to rate performance measures of their ﬁrms from “worse than competition” to “better than competition” on a continuous scale (worse than competition = 0, better than competition = 100) for the last ﬁscal year. The relative perceived performance is measured for 1 year because it is the common period for ﬁrms which have been using TQM practices. This study was pilot tested at a joint dinner meeting of the American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) and the Institute for Supply Man- agement (ISM, formerly the National Association of Purchasing Management). We tested the study there because the test sample was similar to our actual sam- ple. Statistical analyses were performed on the data obtained from 11 respondents, but our statistical tests were restricted to Cronbach’s alpha (α) and a few cor- relations because the sample was small. The values of Cronbach’s α obtained for each factor were sat- isfactory, exceeding, as they did, the threshold value of 0.70 suggested by Nunnally and Bernstein (1994). Additional interviews with the ISM board members who participated in the pilot study showed that the questionnaire needed only a few minor changes in wording to clarify two questions that were to be used in the actual study. 3.2. Target population and survey procedure The pilot study and power analysis determined a target sample of 1884 business units. The industries most likely to implement TQM and JITP were iden- tiﬁed through a literature review. The SIC codes of the industries from which target respondents would be selected were submitted to the American Society for Quality (ASQ) and the ISM, which supplied ad- dresses for chosen respondents. In addition to indus- try speciﬁcations, other criteria were relevant to the selection of target respondents. We preferred that re- spondents hold a high rank in their companies. An- other concerned ﬁnding respondents who were likely to be familiar with the implementation of TQM and JITP in their companies and knowledgeable about their ﬁrm’s performance. Job titles provided by ASQ and ISM such as quality manager, continuous improve- ment manager, and supplier and quality manager indi- cated that those organizations had implemented TQM techniques in some form. 420 H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 Following the Total Design Methodology sug- gested by Dillman (1978), we mailed questionnaires; cover letters; and postage-paid, self-addressed re- turn envelopes to the 1884 subjects. We followed his four-step procedure, although our response rate was sufﬁciently high after the second and third steps that the fourth step was not pursued. We received 383 replies. One was unusable, so we had 382 usable surveys, a 20.3% response rate, which is in line with that of other studies (e.g. Choi and Eboch, 1998; Das et al., 2000; Madu et al., 1995). By testing the difference of the interest variables between early and late respondents, an estimate of non-response bias was calculated (Armstrong and Overton, 1977). To test the non-response bias, two sample t-test procedures were conducted for TQM, JITP, and three perceived performance factors. None of the t-test results indicated a signiﬁcant differ- ence between the two response waves on the means of these variables. The second test of non-response bias concerned the ﬁrms’ demographics: number of employees, annual sales and ownership of the organization. χ2tests were run to ﬁnd out whether there was a signiﬁcant difference in the three demo- graphic variables between early and late respondents. Results indicated that no signiﬁcant differences on demographics existed between the two waves of re- sponses. Fifty-nine respondents either returned the blank questionnaire in the provided envelope or con- tacted the researcher by phone to explain why they chose not to participate in the study. The results of statistical tests and qualitative data indicate that non-respondents did not differ signiﬁcantly from respondents. 3.3. Sample demographics Missing values were neither calculated nor substi- tuted for the performance measures, so the ﬁnal sam- ple used to test the research model was reduced to 214. Replies came from 42 states, although the tar- get sample included ﬁrms from all 48 states. No ﬁrms in Delaware, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, Nevada and Wyoming answered the questionnaire. Moreover, the ﬁnal sample also lacked responses from Missis- sippi, Oregon, Vermont, and West Virginia. Thus, the non-responses were not clustered geographically. The 38 states that comprised the sample did, however, provide a fair, representative coverage of geographical differences in the US. The majority of respondents ﬁlled positions with titles such as president, vice president, director, man- ager, and coordinator. Additionally, the respondents’ functions were concerned with quality practices, gen- eral management, engineering, and purchasing, thus, they were likely to pay careful attention to perfor- mance measures (Germain and Dröge, 1997). We concluded that the survey’s respondents did pos- sess the knowledge required to answer the questions appropriately. Although the organizations that make up the sam- ple represent various manufacturing industries (SIC codes 20–39) and service industries (e.g. transporta- tion, wholesale, ﬁnancial, and health care), the sam- ple is skewed toward manufacturing ﬁrms. Fifteen percent of the sample is comprised of service ﬁrms. The most well-represented industries in the manufac- turing sector are rubber and miscellaneous products (8.5%); fabricated metal (8.9%); machinery and com- puter (7.9%); electrical and electronic (11.2%); and measuring, analyzing and controlling instruments (9.8%). Our cross-industry sample is appropriate, as Pannirselvam and Ferguson (2001) suggest, because distinctions between manufacturing and service have become blurred as manufacturers have become more responsive to customers and service organizations more concerned about quality process and output. Approximately 30.4% of the ﬁrms had 100 or fewer employees, 23.4% of the ﬁrms employed between 101 and 250 workers, 12.6% of the ﬁrms had 251–500 on the payroll, and 33.6% of the ﬁrms had more than 500 employees. About 28.5% of the ﬁrms reported annual sales of US$ 12.5 million or less, and 25% of the ﬁrms had annual sales between US$ 12.5 million and 50 mil- lion. The ﬁrms that had annual sales between US$ 51 million and 100 million comprised about 8% of the ﬁ- nal sample. Companies with annual sales between US$ 101 million and 500 million accounted for 25.2% of the ﬁnal sample, and approximately another 8% of the ﬁrms had annual sales of more than US$ 500 million. 3.4. Tests for reliability and validity This section reports the results of tests for relia- bility and three components of construct validity— unidimensionality, convergent validity and discrimi- H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 421 nant validity. First, reliability of each scale of TQM and performance constructs was estimated by calculat- ing Cronbach’s α (Cronbach, 1951). Several items in the TQM factors that did not contribute to the α values of the scales were dropped (see Appendix A). None of the items in the performance construct was elimi- nated. All TQM and perceived performance scales had acceptable reliability levels, values of α equal to 0.70 or higher (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994). To establish the unidimensionality of factors, an exploratory factor analysis using principal component extraction with a varimax rotation was separately performed for TQM and perceived performance con- structs. Because a signiﬁcant number of the organiza- tions did not have quality departments, the questions relating to a quality department were eliminated from the exploratory factor analysis of TQM. The examination of eigenvalues and screen test results re- vealed eight factors of TQM. What were proposed as separate scales—supplier cooperation and materials quality—actually formed a single factor; hence, the name of the factor “supplier quality management” in the study by Saraph et al. (1989) is retained. Process management emerged as two factors, showing the same pattern Saraph et al. (1989) found in their study. This study conﬁrms the existence of two separate scales, which I have called “inspection” and “process management.” The other items formed the expected factors. As a result of examining the loadings and communalities, several items were also dropped in this step (see Appendix A). The inspection scale was not included in the additional data analyses discussed in the following sections because it was deemed to add little value to the content of quality management. In the case of the perceived performance construct, three factors emerged. They were not, however, the same as the proposed scales: ﬁnancial and market performance, quality performance, and inventory management performance. The indicators of these performance factors are listed in Appendix A and described in Section 2. (For more details about the research method and the tests for reliability and factor analyses, see Kaynak, 1997.) Cronbach’s α for each ﬁnal scale pertaining to TQM and performance was recalculated, and the reliability values for each factor exceeded the threshold value. Prior to evaluating the structural equation model (SEM), the validity of the measurement models was tested (Byrne, 1998; Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1993a). In other words, the resulting scales in exploratory fac- tor analysis were evaluated and reﬁned by a conﬁr- matory factor analysis (CFA) before testing the full latent variable model (Gerbing and Anderson, 1988). The measurement model for each factor was estimated separately, then, after combining the factors into pairs, each pair was estimated separately. After estimating the measurement model for all factors without con- straining the covariance matrix of the factors, the SEM for the factors together with the measurement mod- els was estimated. At each step, whether or not the model ﬁts the data was assessed. This assessment of the model was done by examining the standard errors, t-values, standardized residuals, modiﬁcation indices, and a number of goodness-of-ﬁt statistics (Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1993a). LISREL 8.14 software (Jöreskog and Sörbom, 1993b) was employed to test the measurement models and the research model. The ﬁt indices used in this study to estimate measurement models are the ratio of χ2 to degree of freedom, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), a consistent version of the Akaike’s Information Criterion (CAIC), the Parsi- mony Goodness-of-Fit Index (PGFI), the Parsimony Normed Fit Index (PNFI), and the Comparative Fit Index (CFI). These ﬁt indices, with the exception of RMSEA, were chosen because of their abilities to adjust for model complexity and degrees of freedom. Although RMSEA is sensitive to model complexity, it is one of the most informative criteria as to an abso- lute ﬁt (see Byrne, 1998 for details). Recommended values of these ﬁt indices for satisfactory ﬁt of a model to data are presented in Table 3. The assumptions of multivariate analysis—norma- lity, linearity, and homoscedasticity—were tested for the variables used in the measurement models. Anal- yses for the assumptions of the multivariate model indicated no statistically signiﬁcant violations. During the estimation of the measurement mod- els for TQM and perceived performance constructs, an examination of the modiﬁcation indices and stan- dardized residuals revealed redundant items in some scales. These redundant items were eliminated, which resulted in better-ﬁtted models (Byrne, 1998). A com- parison of goodness-of-ﬁt statistics relating to each measurement model to the recommended values of these ﬁt indices (see Table 3) reveals satisfactory ﬁt of Table 3 Test results of the measurement models and structural model Goodness-of-ﬁt statistics χ2/df Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) Akaike’s Information Criterion (CAIC) CAIC for Saturated Model CAIC for Independent Model Parsimony Goodness-of-Fit Index (PGFI) Parsimony Normed Fit Index (PNFI) Comparative Fit Index (CFI) Measurement model for TQM 657.16/383 = 1.72 0.058 1179.17 2960.18 5383.51 0.69 0.77 0.94 Measurement model for ﬁrm performance 52.03/24 = 2.17 0.074 185.72 286.47 1146.98 0.51 0.63 0.97 Structural model 1167.46/683 = 1.71 0.058 1784.96 4965.46 6992.04 0.69 0.76 0.92 Recommended values for satisfactory ﬁt of a model to data <3.0a <0.08b <Saturated model and independence modelc >0.50d >0.50d >0.90b a Bollen (1989), Carmines and McIver (1981), Hair et al.

(See the ﬁrst value in parenthesis next to remaining each item.) The mean values, standard de- viations, bivariate correlations, and Cronbach’s α for reﬁned scales are presented in Table 4. The resulting values of Cronbach’s α and factor loadings establish the reliability and unidimensionality of the measures used in this study. The extent to which multiple attempts to measure the same constructs are in agreement is the issue in convergent validity (Bagozzi et al., 1991; Hoskisson et al., 1993). An instrument has convergent validity if the correlations between measures of the same con- struct using different methods are high (Crocker and Algina, 1986). In measurement studies, each item in the scale can be considered a different method for mea- suring the construct (Ahire et al., 1996). A test of each item’s coefﬁcient was used to assess convergent valid- ity. If each item’s coefﬁcient is greater than twice its standard error (t-value), then measures indicate high convergent validity (cf. Krause, 1999). The t-value of each retained item is presented in Appendix A. All t-values are signiﬁcant, indicating high convergence validity. The concern with discriminant validity is the de- gree to which measures of different factors are discrete (Bagozzi et al., 1991; Hoskisson et al., 1993). An in- strument has discriminant validity if the correlations between measures of different factors using the same method of measurement are lower than the reliability coefﬁcients (Crocker and Algina, 1986). The bivariate correlations between seven TQM and three perceived performance factors are presented in Table 4. Signiﬁ- cant correlations are expected because of the theoret- ical relation between them and the large size of the sample. Nevertheless, the correlation coefﬁcients were lower than the reliability coefﬁcients, suggesting that measures have discriminant validity. Fig. 2.

Discussion 5.1. Discussion of results The primary purposes of this study were to in- vestigate the relationships among TQM practices and to identify the direct and indirect effects of TQM practices on the various dimensions of performance. Through testing the hypothesized structural model, which was developed based on a comprehensive liter- ature review, these purposes were accomplished. The signiﬁcant implications of the results of the structural model testing for researchers and practitioners, respec- tively, are discussed in the rest of this section. The ﬁndings as a whole suggest that a positive rela- tionship exists between the extent to which companies implement TQM and ﬁrm performance. This overall result corroborates the studies (Douglas and Judge, 2001; Easton and Jarrell, 1998; Hendricks and Singhal, 1996, 1997) in which TQM is operationalized as a single construct. This validation is important because, to investigate the relationship between TQM and per- formance, Easton and Jarrell (1998) and Hendricks and Singhal (1996, 1997) employed different research methodologies from that utilized in this study (see Table 2). As Palich et al. (2000) point out, it is impor- tant to obtain consistent research results among mul- tiple studies using a variety of research methods to make strong statements “about the strength and gen- erality of the ﬁndings” (p. 161). Dow et al. (1999) argue that a fundamental weak- ness in the quality management literature is the assumption, without any empirical testing, of the in- terdependence of quality management practices. (It should be noted that the empirical ﬁndings supporting the interdependence of quality management practices were published by Anderson et al., 1995 and Flynn et al., 1995.) Thus, another signiﬁcant ﬁnding of this study is the validation of the interdependence of TQM practices, which supports both the results of studies (e.g. Das et al., 2000; Flynn et al., 1995; Ho et al., 2001) referred to earlier in this research and the theory of TQM suggested by quality gurus (e.g. Deming, 1993). The ﬁndings also show that assessment of manage- ment leadership is necessary when the effectiveness of TQM implementation is investigated. Management leadership is directly related to training, employee relations, supplier quality management, and prod- uct design, and indirectly related to quality data and reporting, and process management. Effective lead- ership by management also indirectly affects ﬁrm performance through the mediating effects of the other six practices of TQM. The results also demon- strate the importance of two other infrastructural practices—training and employee relations—to the assessment of TQM implementation. Training and employee relations are directly related to quality data and reporting, and they are indirectly related to sup- plier quality management, product/service design, and process management through quality data and report- ing. As with management leadership, they indirectly affect ﬁrm performance. Quality data and reporting, one of the core TQM practices, does not have any direct effects on any of the three performance dimensions; however, the scale of quality data and reporting has indirect inﬂuences on them through supplier quality management, prod- uct/service design, and process management. The con- ﬁrmed indirect effect of training and direct effect of quality data and reporting on process management in this study explain the lack of signiﬁcant relationships found between task-related training and process man- agement in the studies by Anderson et al. (1995), Forza and Flippini (1998), and Rungtusanatham et al. (1998). Thus, future studies should evaluate availability and 426 H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 use of timely quality data when researchers investigate the relationships between TQM practices and assess the success of TQM implementation. Supplier quality management emerges as an impor- tant component of TQM, directly and positively affect- ing product/service design, process management, and inventory management performance. Supplier quality management has an indirect effect on improved qual- ity performance through product/service design and process management. It is important that when inves- tigating the role of supplier quality management in the effectiveness of TQM implementation, researchers deﬁne inventory management performance as a rele- vant performance measure. It is also important that they recognize the indirect positive effects of supplier quality management on quality performance, and ﬁ- nancial and market performance. The ﬁndings regard- ing the effects of supplier quality management also point to some limitations of the conclusions reached in several studies that investigated the relation between TQM and performance. One of the ﬁndings, among others, by Powell (1995), for example, is that close- ness to suppliers only marginally correlates with ﬁnan- cial performance. He concludes that the most critical factors of successful TQM implementation are exec- utive commitment, open organization, and employee empowerment, but he overlooks a possible indirect ef- fect of closeness to suppliers on ﬁnancial performance. In another study, Mohrman et al. (1995) found that no signiﬁcant relation existed between TQM (TQM is operationalized as two dimensions: core TQM prac- tices and production-oriented practices) and inventory turnover. As the ﬁnding of this study shows, supplier quality management is the only TQM practice that has a direct effect on inventory turnover. Thus, in their study, the non-signiﬁcant ﬁnding may have been due to the information lost by combining TQM practices. Flynn et al. (1995) pointed out the missing link between product design process and process ﬂow management scales and called for its future inves- tigation. Thus, another notable result in this study is the signiﬁcant direct effect of product/service de- sign on process management. Product/service design positively contributes to quality performance directly as well as indirectly through process management. Process management is another core TQM practice that is directly and positively related to quality per- formance. This result conﬁrms the ﬁndings in studies (Ahire and Dreyfus, 2000; Flynn et al., 1995; Forza and Flippini, 1998) that investigated the relation of process management to quality performance. The direct relation of inventory management per- formance to quality performance shows that improve- ments in quality, productivity, and on-time delivery are partly due to reduced inventories. Both the indirect effect of inventory management and the direct effect of quality performance on ﬁnancial and market per- formance validate the notion that the improvements in operating performance result in increased sales and market share, thereby providing a competitive edge to companies. In summary, then, the three TQM practices which have direct effects on operating performance (inven- tory management and quality performance) are sup- plier quality management, product/service design, and process management. Management leadership, train- ing, employee relations, and quality data and reporting affect operating performance through supplier qual- ity management, product/service design, and process management. The positive effect of TQM practices on ﬁnancial and market performance is mediated through operating performance. This ﬁnding is consistent with the results in the study by Grandzol and Gershon (1997). it is apparent Given the discussion above, that scholars who engage in TQM research should pay attention to several research design issues if they wish to reach theoretically sound conclusions. First, the multidimensionality of the TQM construct should be recognized. Second, a broad set of performance variables—including operating, market, and ﬁnan- cial measures—relevant to TQM practices should be measured. Third, researchers must be aware that the positive effect of each TQM practice on various lev- els of performance is different. Finally, data analyses more sophisticated than a series of multiple regres- sion or correlations should be performed because it is important to be able to identify the direct and indirect effects of TQM practices. As the results of this study show, the relationships among TQM practices and the effects of these practices on ﬁrm performance are too complex to be identiﬁed by performing regression analysis or correlations. The conﬁrmed positive effects of TQM practices on ﬁrm performance in this study is encouraging for practitioners. The initiative in implementing TQM H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 427 may originate at different levels of an organization. In companies that operate in highly global competi- tive environments and in quality-focused markets, the parent company may push divisions and/or strategic business units to adopt TQM practices (Handﬁeld and Ghosh, 1994). In some instances, as expressed by some of this study’s respondents, functional man- agers at local levels may recognize the need for TQM implementation to respond to competitive challenges. The empirically validated positive relation of TQM to ﬁrms’ performance such as that documented in this study, can be very useful for the leaders who take the initiative in quality improvement to promote and ob- tain the resources needed for TQM implementation. TQM has, as this study shows, much to offer ﬁrms that wish to improve their performance. The accounts of speciﬁc and individual less-than-successful efforts to implement TQM should not be disheartening, for the problems might lie in the implementation of TQM rather than in TQM practices themselves. This study’s ﬁnding of the interdependent nature of TQM practices helps explain why TQM has not pro- duced maximum beneﬁts for every company that has implemented it. Management leadership clearly has a signiﬁcant role to ﬁll in a successful implementation of TQM practices. The more aggressive top man- agement is in the implementation of TQM, the more training employees at all levels get. Moreover, man- agement commitment to TQM empowers employees and makes them more conscious of the organization’s goals. Management leadership is also important in forging strategic partnerships with suppliers and in creating products that are consumer focused and man- ufacturable. Too often, however, a serious commit- ment on the part of top management to TQM is weak or missing. Several respondents complained about management’s lack of support, its resistance to change, and the failure of the organization’s structure to change when TQM practices were implemented. Problems like these make it difﬁcult to cultivate and take advan- tage of opportunities for TQM’s potential beneﬁts. It that is apparent the practitioners as well as researchers cannot simply pick and choose a few techniques to implement. The structural model pro- posed and tested in this study may offer a ﬂow chart to practitioners for effective TQM implementation. Companies ﬁrst should secure a complete top man- agement commitment to TQM implementation, and this commitment should motivate management to provide their employees quality-related training, in- stitute teamwork, and employee involvement to lay the foundation for other practices of TQM. Actually, it should do more. Establishing an effec- tive system for collecting and disseminating quality data throughout the organization in a timely manner is necessary to realize improvements in supplier qual- ity management, product/service design, and process management. Then, ﬁrms can focus on developing co- operative relationships with their suppliers to improve the quality of incoming materials and to involve them in the buyer ﬁrms’ product/service design and process management activities. Coordination and cooperation among employees who participate in product/service design and process management are essential to im- proving quality performance of ﬁrms. All in all, a ﬁrm cannot simply select some of the TQM practices dis- cussed above and expect to realize full beneﬁts from implementing partial TQM. 5.2. Limitations of ﬁndings Every effort was made at the design stage of this study to obtain reliable and valid ﬁndings as presented in Section 3. Nevertheless, several limitations of this study should be discussed in this section. Because it uses the same data for both exploratory and conﬁr- matory factor analysis, this study has a major limi- tation. As the literature makes clear (Anderson and Gerbing, 1988; Kelloway, 1995), using the same data for both analyses is frequently done, probably because it streamlines research activities (Huber and Power, 1985). Research like that done for this study requires substantial investments of time and money, more so than in ﬁelds that allow researchers to collect data from one organization by studying the responses from a large sample comprised of respondents within it (Huber and Power, 1985). Because a cross-sectional survey method was utilized here, causal inferences were derived from existing theory and research only. This is, admittedly, a controversial approach, but Cook and Campbell (1979) say that it is acceptable to clarify theory and assess speciﬁc causal effects from correla- tional research data with structural and path analyses. As far as construct validity is concerned, the use of self-reported data constitutes a major limitation, primarily because common method variance (CMV) 428 H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 is an acknowledged threat to studies that rely on self-reports for their data. A post hoc analysis of CMV—an evaluation of key informants, Harman’s one-factor test, and multiple methods and sources— was performed in an earlier study by Kaynak (1997). The size of this study’s sample, given the time and resource limitations that constrained it, made it im- possible to use another method to gather data or corroborate what respondents reported about the ex- tent to which their ﬁrms had implemented TQM. Likewise, the major problem when investigating per- formance at the business-unit level is the difﬁculty of obtaining objective performance measures. It is widely reported in the literature that managers are reluctant to share objective data with researchers (e.g. Choi and Liker, 1995; Swamidass and Newell, 1987). The same problem was also observed in this study. Furthermore, because archival data are reported at the corporate rather than the business-unit level and so are unavailable for small and private businesses, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd secondary data on ﬁnancial perfor- mance. It was because of these difﬁculties that Choi and Eboch (1998) and Stanley and Wisner (2001) opted to use perceptual data to obtain a large sample. An attempt was made for this study to collect sec- ondary objective data on the number of employees and the annual sales of ﬁrms from other sources. The high convergence between self-reported and archival data on number of employees (r = 0.91) and annual sales of ﬁrms (r = 0.87) indicates a high level of response consistency. Although analyses of key informants— Harman’s one-factor and secondary data sources—do not completely eliminate the possibility of same source, self-report biases, the results indicated non-signiﬁcant common method variance. Overall, validity and reliability in this study seem adequate. test, 6. Conclusion and further research This study contributes to the TQM literature by val- idating the direct and indirect relations among TQM practices and the effects of these practices on ﬁrm per- formance. With the exception of Flynn et al. (1995), the TQM practices investigated in this study repre- sent a wider domain of TQM than the other studies in which direct and indirect effects of TQM practices on performance are identiﬁed. In addition, measurement of performance at three levels in this research reveals more insights than the other studies do into the relation of TQM practices to ﬁrms’ performance. It also sheds more light than they do on the relationships among three levels of performance: inventory management, quality, and ﬁnancial and market performance. A by-product of this study is a reﬁned version of the questionnaire constructed by Saraph et al. (1989) that can be used to measure TQM implementation without making excessive demands on the time of both respondents and researchers. The ﬁnal TQM measurement model includes 30 items, as indicated in Appendix A. In addition, a scale on customer re- lations can be added in future studies as one of the techniques of TQM. Evaluating customer relations as a technique of TQM is becoming more viable because TQM organizations are customer focused. Measure- ment studies on TQM discussed in this paper, as a part of the literature review, provide measurement items for the scale of customer focus. As pointed out by Amundson (1998), researchers should broaden their focus to include more complex issues regarding TQM implementation rather than simply replicating studies that identify TQM practices. Given that the response rate and the length of a questionnaire are inversely related, the shortened version of the ques- tionnaire presented in this study allows researchers to investigate the relation of TQM to other variables of interest without seriously hurting response rate. The ﬁndings of this study, as well as some of those reported in the literature reviewed in this paper, sup- port the positive effects of TQM practices on ﬁrms’ performance. A lack of top management commitment to the implementation of TQM has emerged as a pos- sible reason for the failure of TQM systems in some organizations. Nevertheless, further empirical research should be conducted to assess the degree of effective organizational functioning under TQM systems to re- ﬁne and sharpen our insights into the relationship be- tween TQM practices and ﬁrms’ performance. Having identiﬁed a number of gaps between TQM processes and outcomes in their conceptual study, Hackman and Wageman (1995) support the contention that the effec- tiveness of TQM should be measured in order to de- termine whether TQM changes the way people work together to meet customer requirements. Effectiveness criteria such as organizational learn- ing, employee satisfaction, decentralized structure, H. Kaynak / Journal of Operations Management 21 (2003) 405–435 429 and resource acquisition should be assessed in the companies implementing TQM. Although TQM is learning-oriented, many learning failures in organiza- tions that have implemented TQM have been reported (Hackman and Wageman, 1995). The effectiveness of the organizations that implement TQM depends on their ability to satisfy their employees, a neces- sary goal for companies that wish to realize beneﬁts from employee involvement. Furthermore, employee participation in monitoring, detecting, and correct- ing quality problems requires decentralization and delegation in organizations implementing TQM. De- centralization, suggest Germain and Spears (1999), not only increases the number of minds searching for imaginative solutions to a ﬁrm’s quality management problems, it also increases the number of internal groups that will support creative solutions once they are found. Finally, the effectiveness of TQM or- ganizations should be measured by their degree of integration with their supplier bases because supplier quality management is a critical component of TQM.

Measurement scales, items and their sources The items marked with the symbol (†) were retained after testing the measurement models. The ﬁrst value in parenthesis for each retained item indicates the stan- dardized factor loadings. The second value represents the t-value resulting from testing each item’s coefﬁ- cient. (The ﬁrst item in each scale does not have an associated t-value because it has a ﬁxed parameter in LISREL.)
