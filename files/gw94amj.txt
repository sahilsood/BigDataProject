WADDOCK  Boston College  In this study, we hypothesize that institutions invest more heavily in  companies with strong corporate social performance. Analysis indi-  cated a significant, positive relationship between social performance  and the number of institutions holding the shares of a company and a  positive but insignificant relationship between social performance and  the percentage of shares held by institutions. We conclude that improv-  ing a company's corporate social performance invokes no penalty in  institutional ownership.  In recent years, the growth in the stock holdings of institutional owners,  such as pension funds and mutual funds, has been substantial. In the com-  puter industry, institutional ownership grew from 16 percent of common  equity in 1976 to almost 50 percent in 1984. In the chemical industry, it grew  from 15 to 52 percent in the same period (Graves & Waddock, 1990). For  some firms, the level of institutional ownership is much higher. In mid-  1991, institutions held 73 percent of the shares of Federal Express, 74 per-  cent of Motorola, 76 percent of Lotus Development, and 79 percent of Aetna  Life & Casualty (Standard & Poor's, 1991). From these data it is clear that  corporate managers must take into account the concerns of institutional  owners if their company's stock is to be attractive to a large and growing  segment of the financial market.  This study was designed to examine the relationship between institu-  tional ownership and corporate social performance (CSP) in firms. Specifi-  cally, we asked, Does a high level of CSP lead to an increase in institutional  ownership? We constructed a new index that aggregates eight different at-  tributes of CSP and then determined whether high values on this index  tended to be linked to high levels of institutional ownership. This is the first  study to use such a comprehensive index of corporate social performance.  We wish to thank Steven D. Lydenberg of Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co., Inc., for his  assistance with the data and the anonymous referees of this journal for many helpful sugges-  tions.  1034 This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:48:24 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1994  Graves and Waddock  1035  Theory  BACKGROUND  According to myopic institutions theory (Hansen & Hill, 1991), institu-  tional owners tend to be more shortsighted than individual investors. This  shortsightedness occurs, ex hypothesi, because institutional money manag-  ers must compete for accounts and are reviewed and rewarded on the basis  of annual or even quarterly performance. Accordingly, it is assumed that  their investment decisions will be based on the same short time horizons  (Woolridge, 1988). The theory is relevant to our study because investments  in corporate social performance tend to be long-term (Mahapatra, 1984), and  so there may be an incompatibility between an institutional owner's time  horizon and the time needed to realize the benefits from a commitment to  CSP.  Another theoretical question is the relationship between corporate so-  cial performance and investment risk. Spicer (1978), for example, argued  that institutional investors consider low-CSP firms to be riskier investments,  and his results supported this thesis. This risk arises, inter alia, from the  possibility of costly sanctions resulting from adverse legislative or regulatory  actions, judicial decisions, or consumer retaliation. The likelihood of such  actions then leads investors to revise their perceptions of the probability  distribution of future costs and revenues (Shane & Spicer, 1983). Spicer cited  survey data that showed "a seemingly widespread view within the invest-  ment community that a moderate to strong association does exist" (1978: 96)  between the risk of a corporation and its attention to issues of social respon-  sibility and noted that, in terms of the theory of finance, an investment in a  company that is socially irresponsible could be inefficient. By choosing a  similar but socially responsible company, an investor might achieve the  same return with less risk. Investors are assumed to consider both risk and  the return, and high social responsibility may reduce risk, thus providing an  incentive for company managers to invest in positive CSP measures.  According to efficient market theory (Fama, 1970), institutional inves-  tors consider both of the above arguments when determining the appropriate  risk-adjusted discount rate to use in discounting future cash flows.1 Myopic  institutional behavior is related to the discount rate, and interpretation of  CSP as a risk-reducing measure is related to risk adjustment. Efficient market  theory suggests that investors consider the effect of publicly available infor-  mation on both future cash flow and investment risk simultaneously. If a  firm makes a major social performance investment-in, say, pollution con-  trol-that reduces cash flow but does not reduce risk, the present value of all  future cash flows will be reduced and the stock may be sold in accordance  with the predictions of myopic institutions theory. If, on the other hand, a  1 An investor's discount rate is the rate at which future benefits are discounted because of  the investor's preference for current over future income.

On balance, then, to predict the effect of a CSP-  enhancing commitment by a firm, an investigator needs to know the effects  of the measure on both cash flow and risk. To the extent that the performance  of firms is comparable, however, institutional investors will tend to choose  less risky stocks from firms with strong social performance.  Empirical Work  Several empirical studies have examined predictions based on myopic  institutions theory (Baysinger, Kosnik, & Turk, 1991; Graves, 1988, 1990;  Hansen & Hill, 1991). Only Graves (1988) found support for the theory; the  findings of the others contradicted it. The last two works, both large-scale,  multiple-industry studies, are especially compelling, and so the main body  of empirical work seems to refute the myopic institutions hypothesis. The  theory may have proved unsupportable because of changes in the scale of  institutional shareholdings since the mid-1980s. Institutional holdings have  increased to the point that institutions can no longer move quickly out of a  stock that has lost favor; thus, these investors have become longer-term  holders by necessity, and many have become actively involved in the gov-  ernance of companies that they own. From these results we concluded that  the argument for a short time horizon among institutional investors is no  longer supported and therefore did not use this theory as a basis for our  hypothesis.  Teoh and Shiu (1990) examined the attitudes of institutional owners  toward corporate social performance and sources of information about it.  They found that institutional investors did not normally alter their invest-  ment decisions on the basis of company assertions about CSP contained in  conventional financial information, such as annual reports. However, insti-  tutional investors took CSP information into account if it was quantified,  focused on specific issues, and obtained from disinterested parties. Further,  the work of Heiner (1983) suggested that institutional investors were more  able than individual investors to assimilate and act upon information about  socially responsible corporate practices.  Coffey and Fryxell (1991), in the only published study specifically ad-  dressing the relationship between institutional ownership and corporate so-  cial performance, found, to their surprise, a negative association between  compliance with the Sullivan Principles2 and institutional ownership. They  found no significant relationship between corporate charitable giving and  institutional ownership but discovered a significant, positive relationship  2 This is a set of guidelines that encouraged corporations to work against racial oppression  in South Africa.

Their mixed findings may be explained by the structure of their  study, which did not control for profit, company size, or industry; any of  these variables could have confounded the estimations. And since the study  was purely cross-sectional in design, no inference could be made about the  direction of causation. Thus, although this study, as the first of its kind, is a  valuable contribution to the literature, it is not definitive and seems to leave  unresolved the true relationship between corporate social performance and  institutional ownership.  Little empirical work has been done on the question of institutional risk  aversion. Chaganti and Damanpour (1991) found a negative association be-  tween stock ownership by institutional investors and firms' debt-to-capital  ratios, supporting the proposition that institutional investors are risk-averse.  We generalized from that traditional financial risk aversion, interpreting  increased CSP as a risk-reducing measure and assuming that, ceteris paribus,  institutional investors will view high social performance favorably.  Hypothesis  Our view of CSP as a risk-reducing measure, together with the predic-  tions of efficient market theory that a rational investor, choosing between  two companies with the same expected return, will select the one with less  risk, led to the following:  Hypothesis 1: Improvements in a company's corporate  social performance will increase institutional ownership.  The model we used to examine this hypothesis was IOt = f(CSPt_1, control  variablest-i), where IO is a measure of institutional ownership, CSP is a  measure of corporate social performance, and t is time.  Data  METHODS  This study is based on a group of companies from the Standard & Poor's  500. Missing or unusable institutional ownership or CSP data reduced the  data set from 500 to 453 firms. Missing financial data further reduced it to  430 firms.  Dependent Variables  The primary focus of this research was the behavior of institutional  owners with respect to corporate social performance. Institutional owner-  ship was measured in two ways: (1) as the number of institutions that held  shares in each company and (2) as the percentage of each company's out-  standing shares owned by institutions. Institutional ownership data were  taken from Standard & Poor's Stock Guides for mid-1991.

We used 1990 data for each of these variables, providing a one-  year lag between the measurement of the independent and dependent vari-  ables.  Corporate social performance. Corporate social performance is notori-  ously difficult to measure consistently (Aupperle, 1991; Aupperle, Carroll, &  Hatfield, 1985; Gephart, 1991; Miles, 1987; Wolfe & Aupperle, 1991; Wood,  1991). Previous researchers have attempted to measure CSP in a variety of  ways, including using forced-choice surveys (Aupperle, 1991; Aupperle et  al., 1985), the Fortune reputational and social responsibility index  (McGuire, Sundgren, & Schneeweis, 1988), content analysis of documents  (Wolfe, 1991), behavioral and perceptual measures (Wokutch & McKinney,  1991), and case study methodologies (Clarkson, 1991).  Each of these techniques has limitations. Survey methods have prob-  lems relating to return rates and consistency among raters. The Fortune  ratings have been criticized as being as much a measure of overall corporate  financial performance as of corporate social performance. Document analy-  sis depends upon the comprehensiveness of and the purposes for which the  documents were originally created. Behavioral and perceptual measures po-  tentially suffer from respondent bias and inconsistency. Case study methods  also suffer from both inconsistency and lack of generalizability.  To overcome these problems, corporate social performance should be  uniformly measured across a wide range of companies and for a consistent  range of important social issues. The independent variable used in this study  was an index of CSP that we considered to satisfy these requirements. We  generated this index, which gives a single numerical CSP value for each  company in an analysis, from data developed by Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini  & Co., Inc. (KLD), a financial advisory firm specializing in the assessment of  CSP.  KLD assesses companies on eight attributes of CSP, providing a multi-  dimensional appraisal of their social behavior. These eight attributes con-  cern community relations, employee relations, environment, product, treat-  ment of women and minorities, military contracts, nuclear power, and South  Africa. For each of the first five attributes, KLD rates a company using a  five-step scale ranging from "major strength" to "major weakness." We con-  verted these ratings to numerical values, with +2 representing a major  strength and - 2 representing a major weakness. For the last three attributes,  KLD assesses only weaknesses. Thus, after our conversions, these three at-  tributes had values of -2, -1, or 0. Kinder, Lydenberg, and Domini rates  each company on each of the eight attributes by referring to a consistent,  largely objective, set of screening criteria (Kinder, Lydenberg, & Domini,  1990).  The assessment scheme used by KLD offers several benefits over rating This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:48:24 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1994  Graves and Waddock  1039  mechanisms used in previous studies: (1) It rates each company on multiple  attributes considered important to social performance. (2) Because one  group is doing the ratings, using an objective set of screening criteria, the  ratings are applied consistently across all companies and are replicable. (3)  Because KLD operates a service that supplies information to the investment  community at large, it rates all of the Standard & Poor's 500 firms. (4) The  group doing the rating consists of knowledgeable individuals not affiliated  with any of the rated companies or with researchers performing studies.  Thus, this firm's scaling process provides unique access to a wide range of  consistently rated firms across a number of important social performance  attributes.  One limitation of the KLD data is that all attributes are essentially given  equal importance, whereas most observers of corporate social performance  consider some areas more important than others. To deal with this issue, we  used weights developed by Ruf, Muralidhar, and Paul (1993) to compute a  weighted average across the eight attribute ratings for each company in the  study. This process resulted in a single-value CSP index for each company  ranging from -2.0, for companies rated lowest on all eight attributes, to  + 1.66, for those rated highest on all eight.  Control variables and analysis. Some differences in institutional own-  ership may result from firm profitability, size, debt level, and industry. We  therefore controlled for each of these variables to isolate the unique contri-  bution of CSP to investment decisions.  Firm profitability was measured by return on assets and return on eq-  uity. Size was measured by total assets and total sales. Debt level was mea-  sured as the ratio of total long-term debt to total assets. All financial data  were taken from COMPUSTAT tapes for 1990. Industries were broken down  by four-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes and represented  in our model by dummy variables.  We used regression analyses to test our hypotheses, employing the two  measures of institutional ownership as the dependent variable and control-  ling for profit, size, debt level, and industry.  Descriptive Statistics and Correlation Analysis  RESULTS  Table 1 shows that, on average, institutions owned about 56 percent of  the equity in the studied firms. There is considerable variance in this figure,  however, from a low of 7.8 percent to a high of 90.7 percent. The average  number of institutions holding shares in the companies was about 345, with  a minimum of 26 and a maximum of 1,429.  Average sales for the companies in our data set were about $6.9 billion,  with average assets about $12 billion. Average return on equity (ROE) was  about 13 percent for the group, return on assets (ROA) about 5 percent, and  the ratio of debt to total assets, about 20 percent.  The debt-to-asset ratio is significantly correlated with both assets and This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:48:24 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  Descriptive Statistics and Pearson Product-Moment Correlations  TABLE 1  Variables N Means s.d.

This multicollinearity caused the estimated  regression coefficient of the debt-to-asset ratio to be insignificant when en-  tered as an explanatory variable in the presence of the other two variables.  There was also a low correlation between the two measures of institutional  ownership, indicating that an increase in the number of institutions holding  a firm's stock does not necessarily lead to an increase in the number of shares  held by institutions.  Regression Analysis  All the regression models calculated used institutional ownership as the  dependent variable. In the first three models, number of institutions holding  shares in a company was the proxy for institutional ownership; in the second  three models, the percentage of a company's shares owned by institutions  represented institutional ownership. In all models, the corporate social per-  formance index was the principal independent variable. In all equations,  size, financial performance, debt-to-asset ratio, and industry (omitted from  the table for space reasons) were control variables. We also included the  squares of sales and assets because, controlling for other variables, we found  that the number of institutions owning a company's stock showed a qua-  dratic relationship with company size.  In the first model, ROE is the proxy for financial performance, and assets  the proxy for size. As the results in Table 2 show, in this model there is a  significant and positive relationship (p < .001) between corporate social  performance and institutional ownership when other factors are held con-  stant. For model 1, the multiple coefficient of determination (R2) is .46. The  R2 for the industry dummy variables alone was .11.  Results for the second and third models were similar. These differ from  the first only in the profitability and size proxies used. In model 2, sales  replace assets. Corporate social performance is still significantly related to  institutional ownership (p < .001), and the explanatory power of the model  increases somewhat. In model 3, where we used ROA to control for financial  performance and assets to control for size, the relationship between CSP and  institutional ownership is still significant (p < .01), although somewhat less  so. The results from all three of these models provide strong support for our  hypothesis, which postulated that high CSP values would result in high  levels of institutional ownership. All three models explain at least 46 per-  cent of the variance in institutional ownership.  The results obtained with use of our control variables are plausible and  reasonable. A significant and positive relationship between firm financial  performance and institutional ownership emerged from our analyses, sug-  gesting that, as we expected, strong financial performance leads to increases  in institutional ownership, with other variables held constant. There was a  negative relationship between the debt-to-asset ratio and institutional own-  ership. This relationship is significant in all but the third model, where  multicollinearity (noted above regarding the correlation table) reduces its  significance. From this pattern of results, we concluded that, ceteris paribus, This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:48:24 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1042  Academy of Management Journal  August  Results of Regression Analyses for Institutions Holding Sharesa  TABLE 2  Variables Model 1 Model 2 Model 3  Dependent  Number of institutions owning shares  Independent  Control  Corporate social performance .15*** .13*** .11**  ROE .11** .11***  ROA .30***  Assets 1.21*** 1.31***  Assets squared - .69*** -.75***  Sales 1.19***  Sales squared -.66***  Debt-to-asset ratio -.15*** -.17 *** - .05  R2 .46 .57 .51  R2 for industry dummy variables alone .11 .11 .11  F 20.32*** 32.68*** 24.88***  a N = 430 for all models.

With respect to firm size, the quadratic relation-  ship we observed suggested that, other things being equal, institutional in-  vestors prefer large firms, but that, when firms pass some size threshold,  those investors view them less favorably.  The results of the models that used the percentage of shares institution-  ally owned as the dependent variable (models 4, 5, and 6, Table 3) were  largely insignificant. These models show a positive relationship between  corporate social performance and the percentage of shares owned by insti-  tutions, but it is not significant in any of the three. Firm financial perfor-  mance and size are also insignificant. The debt-to-asset ratio is significant in  models 4 and 5, paralleling the results of models 1 and 2 and again indicat-  ing risk aversion on the part of institutional owners.  DISCUSSION  Quite clearly, our results indicate that a company incurs no penalty in  terms of its attractiveness to institutional investors for improvements in CSP  ratings, and indeed, the first set of equations clearly suggests that institu-  tions respond favorably to such improvements. There is some consistency  between our results and those of Coffey and Fryxell (1991), who found a  significant and positive relationship between the number of women on a  board of directors and institutional ownership level, and also consistency This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:48:24 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1994  Graves and Waddock  1043  Results of Regression Analyses for Percent of Shares Owned  by Institutionsa  TABLE 3  Variables Model 4 Model 5 Model 6  Dependent  Percent of shares owned by institutions  Independent  Corporate social performance .07 .07 .06  Control  ROE .01 .00  ROA .09  Assets -.13 -.11  Asset squared .11 .09  Sales -.10  Sales squared .01  Debt-to-asset ratio -.12* -.12* -.09  R2 .08 .08 .08  R2 for industry dummy variables alone .02 .02 .02  F 2.09 2.2** 2.23** 2.23**  a N = 430 for all models.

In recent years, there has been a rapid  increase in socially responsible investing and in the information about com-  panies' CSP records that is available (Social Investment Forum, 1993;  Warner, 1990). Our results, which are consistent with the predictions of  Coffee and Fryxell (1991), suggest that institutional investors are taking this  information into account in deciding whether or not to own stock in a given  firm.  The results of our study are consistent with a steadily accumulating  body of evidence that provides little support for the myopic institutions  theory. Our study indicates that there is no penalty for improved corporate  social performance in terms of institutional ownership generally and that  high CSP tends in fact to lead to an increase in the number of institutions  holding a given stock.  Improved corporate social performance, according to some theoretical  perspectives (Shane & Spicer, 1983; Spicer, 1978), lowers investment risk.  Our regression results give strong evidence of institutional risk aversion,  indicating that when firm size, financial performance, and industry are all  held constant, there is a negative relationship between the debt-to-asset ratio  and institutional ownership. This risk aversion, then, can be translated into  a preference for strong CSP, which is what seems to emerge here. Using This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:48:24 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1044  Academy of Management Journal  August  efficient market theory, we interpret this reduction in risk as a lower risk-  adjusted discount rate. Such a decrease would lead a rational investor to  place a higher value on a stock, which in turn would cause managers to be  more willing to make decisions that would yield higher CSP.  The differences in the significance levels of the first three and the sec-  ond three equations require some explanation. Our correlation table shows  a very weak relationship between the percentage of shares owned and the  number of institutions holding shares in a company. Our regression results  are consistent with that weak correlation, since one can observe an increase  in the number of institutions owning a stock with no attendant increase in  the percentage of shares owned if the growth in institutional owners results  mostly from growth in the number of small institutional owners. Many of the  newer socially responsible money management institutions are small ones,  and this fact seems to be one reasonable explanation of the difference in the  significance levels of the two groups of models. For example, eight socially  responsible equity mutual funds reported by the Social Investment Forum in  late 1992 held an average $147 million in assets, but the 231 equity funds  reported by Morningstar Mutual Funds for 1993 held an average $587 mil-  lion in assets.  Another explanation of the difference in significance levels is related to  the difference in the kinds of decisions that each represents. The number-  of-institutions dependent variable is related to a relatively simple, binary  decision by an institution's managers: Will the institution own a stock or  not? Clearly, some (socially responsible) institutional investors will make  such a decision in part on the basis of the corporate social performance of the  firm in question. The percentage-of-shares decision, however, is a consider-  ably more complicated one. Having made a decision to own stock in a firm,  institutional investors may consider a host of other factors that are exoge-  nous to our model. For example, following appropriate portfolio theory, an  institution's managers may consider the covariance in returns between two  firms, both with acceptable corporate social performance, and this may in-  fluence the size of the position they take. Further it has lately become fash-  ionable to invest in high-CSP companies. But high-CSP companies as a  group perform about the same as the market (Coffee & Fryxell, 1991; Social  Investment Forum, 1993), neither substantially better nor worse. And so, in  the absence of strong financial motivation, some institutions may be reacting  to a current need to look socially responsible by making small or token  investments in high-CSP companies.  This article advances the study of corporate social performance and  institutional ownership by adding a new, improved measure to a field in  which measurement problems have always been serious. Our data allowed  us to conclude that institutions buy stock in companies when corporate  social performance improves. Our study and the previous work of others  suggest that managers can conclude that improving a company's social per-  formance will not depress institutional stock ownership.
