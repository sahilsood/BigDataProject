Journal of Management Studies 43:3 May 2006 0022-2380 Corporate Reputation and Social Performance: The Importance of Fit Stephen J. Brammer and Stephen Pavelin University of Bath; University of Reading abstract Utilizing data on a sample of large ﬁrms, we estimate a model of corporate reputation. We ﬁnd reputation, derived from the assessments of managers and market analysts, to be determined by a ﬁrm’s social performance, ﬁnancial performance, market risk, the extent of long-term institutional ownership, and the nature of its business activities. Furthermore, the reputational effect of social performance is found to vary both across sectors, and within sectors across the various types of social performance. Speciﬁcally, our results demonstrate the need to achieve a ‘ﬁt’ among the types of corporate social performance undertaken and the ﬁrm’s stakeholder environment. For example, a strong record of environmental performance may enhance or damage reputation depending on whether the ﬁrm’s activities ‘ﬁt’ with environmental concerns in the eyes of stakeholders. INTRODUCTION The increasing importance of the constructs of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and corporate reputation has, in recent years, been recognized within the strategic management literature by a proliferation of conceptual and empirical work (e.g. Fombrun, 1996; Hillman and Keim, 2001; McWilliams and Siegel, 2000; Podolny, 1993, 1994). The literature has paid particular attention to the relationships between both CSR and reputation and corporate ﬁnancial perfor- mance (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997; Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Waddock and Graves, 1997), consumer perceptions of product quality (Milgrom and Roberts, 1986; Sen and Bhattacharya, 2001), employee morale, productivity, recruitment and retention (Moskowitz, 1972; Turban and Cable, 2003; Turban and Greening, 1996), company ownership characteristics (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Johnson and Greening, 1999), and access to capital (Cochran and Wood, 1984; Hart, 1995).

Pavelin In spite of this burgeoning interest in both CSR and corporate reputation, there has been very little systematic research of potential links between the two. While earlier studies identify a close relationship between corporate reputational capital and social responsibility (Fryxell and Wang, 1994; McGuire et al., 1988), much of this effort has focused upon establishing the meaning of reputational indices (the Fortune ranking chief among them), and conclude that they are most closely related to a ﬁrm’s reputation as a ﬁnancial investment (Fryxell and Wang, 1994). A seminal empirical study by Fombrun and Shanley (1990) provides evidence that social responsiveness, as measured by the level of corporate charitable donations and the presence of a separately endowed corporate charitable foundation, is positively associated with corporate reputation. Williams and Barrett (2000) provide more recent evidence in support of a link between philanthropy and ﬁrm reputation. In addition, they show that the link between philanthropy and reputation is stronger among companies that more frequently violate occupational health and safety and environmental regulations. They argue that, among other things, charitable giving can partially restore a ﬁrm’s reputation after it has committed illegal acts (Williams and Barrett, 2000). Reputation has been deﬁned as ‘a perceptual representation of a company’s past actions and future prospects that describe the ﬁrm’s overall appeal to all its key constituents when compared to other leading rivals’ (Fombrun, 1996, p. 72). As has been highlighted, deﬁnitions such as this emphasize the aggregate or summative nature of corporate reputations that reﬂect the perceptions of a host of individual stakeholders. A variety of deﬁnitions of CSR proposed both in the literature and by a variety of institutions, emphasize a voluntary involvement in the solution of a variety of social issues (e.g. European Commission, 2001; McWilliams and Siegel, 2001). Though often viewed as an aggregate construct, social responsiveness is fundamentally multidimensional and embodies a large and varied range of corpo- rate behaviour in relation to its resources, processes and outputs (Carroll, 1979; Waddock and Graves, 1997; Wood, 1991). Demonstrating a high degree of social responsibility may therefore require a diverse range of activities (including engage- ment in philanthropic activities, reduction of environmental impacts, and the introduction of practices that empower employees), each of which may have a separately identiﬁable impact upon reputation. Furthermore, stakeholder groups have differing expectations regarding ﬁrm behaviour (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990), and the salience of each stakeholder group varies across industries. Therefore, the impact of CSR activism on reputation is jointly contingent upon which type of CSR activity is undertaken, and which industrial sector the ﬁrm is primarily associated with. In this sense, the effect of a ﬁrm’s social performance on its reputation is importantly determined by the ﬁt between sector-speciﬁc characteristics of the ﬁrm’s business environment and the type of social performance the ﬁrm exhibits. This paper analyses the relationship between corporate reputation and social performance for a sample of UK companies. We use reputational data constructed © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006 Corporate Reputation and Social Performance 437 in a similar manner to the Fortune index (which has often been employed in previous work), and make two contributions to the literature. First, we present the ﬁrst systematic analysis of the relationship between reputation and social performance that permits different elements of corporate social performance to have varying effects upon reputations. Second, we explore how the reputational effects of different types of responsiveness initiatives vary across industries. Our contribution is timely in that it echoes recent work that emphasizes the importance of the manner in which ﬁrms implement their social responsiveness initiatives (Porter and Kramer, 2002). In the next section, we introduce a conceptual model of the link between social performance and corporate reputation and introduce our hypotheses. The third section describes the data; the fourth section reports the results, and a ﬁnal section offers some concluding remarks and suggestions for practice. THE DETERMINANTS OF CORPORATE REPUTATION In this section we develop a model of the inﬂuences on corporate reputation and outline a number of hypotheses. Our starting point is Fombrun and Shanley’s seminal model which hypothesizes that corporate reputations are summative rep- resentations of stakeholders’ opinions of ﬁrms which depend on their success in meeting the expectations of those stakeholders (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). A ﬁrm’s current reputation is determined by the signals that publics receive con- cerning its behaviours, whether directly from the ﬁrm or via other information channels, such as the media or the stock market. Stakeholders are expected to have diverse preferences over ﬁrm actions, process and outcomes and reputa- tional assessments depend upon the congruence between the apparent behav- iours of the ﬁrm and the preferences of those publics (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). Following Fombrun and Shanley (1990), we differentiate between various types of signals that relevant publics may receive concerning companies, and which may inﬂuence their perceptions of the ﬁrm. Such signals vary according to whether they originate within or outside the company, and with respect to the type of informa- tion they contain. Our framework hypothesizes that a ﬁrm’s reputation is deter- mined by signals concerning social responsibility and ﬁnancial performance, product quality, ownership composition, size, media visibility and industry. We will discuss each of these in turn. The Link between Corporate Reputation and Social Performance Existing work has argued that social responsiveness can play a signiﬁcant role in promoting favourable relationships with primary stakeholder groups. Stakeholders (such as shareholders, employees, consumers, pressure groups, Government and regulators) that do not view the ﬁrm as legitimate have the power to either arrest © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006 438 S. J. Brammer and S. Pavelin power from managers, or to at least hamper the execution of corporate strategy (Mitchell et al., 1997). Such ‘salient’ stakeholder groups demand attention from corporate management and, to the extent that ﬁrms behave in accordance with their expectations, they will be willing to continue to participate in the activities of the ﬁrm. To the extent that social responsiveness helps managers encourage constructive contributions from stakeholders, we should expect it to augment the ﬁrm’s reputation since the expectations of both managers and other stakeholders are satisﬁed (Donaldson and Preston, 1995). According to an alternative view, CSR activism represents a wasteful discretion- ary act of management, born of altruistic impulse or the desire for self- aggrandisement (Bartkus et al., 2002; Navarro, 1988). Within this view, one would expect social performance to damage the ﬁnancial performance and reputation of the ﬁrm (Friedman, 1970). Indeed, it may have a detrimental effect simply because of a tendency for social investment to crowd out investment in other projects (McWilliams and Siegel, 2001). That is, even if social performance would, ceteris paribus, enhance the reputation of the ﬁrm, this effect is outweighed by the opportunity costs associated with diverting resources away from other activities that would do more to enhance corporate reputation (Russo and Fouts, 1997). However, given evidence that is suggestive of the strategic use of CSR policy (Porter and Kramer, 2002; Saiia et al., 2003), we expect the overall tendency to be for social responsiveness to augment reputation, and propose the following hypothesis. Hypothesis 1: There is a positive relationship between corporate social perfor- mance and reputation. The strength and direction of the relationship between corporate reputation and social performance may be contingent upon the activity a company is engaged in since industry environments are correlated with signiﬁcant pressure from institu- tional, and other, stakeholders (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978; Scott, 1987, 1995). This suggests that industry may play a moderating role in the relationship between reputation and social performance because of the presence of industry-speciﬁc stakeholder pressures for improved social responsiveness from primary stakehold- ers such as employees, customers, communities, and legal and regulatory bodies. Such pressures typically arise because of the close association between some eco- nomic activities and severe social and environmental externalities that lead to the increased salience of particular issues in ways that lead to increased pressure on companies to respond (Berman et al., 1999; Miles, 1987; Rowley and Berman, 2000). Moreover, satisfying the demands of these constituencies for improved social responsiveness is in the interests of companies because ﬁrms are typically dependent upon them for resources that are necessary to their continuing survival and success (Clarkson, 1995; Hillman and Keim, 2001; Mitchell et al., 1997). In © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006 Corporate Reputation and Social Performance 439 light of the heightened relevance of social responsiveness for meeting the expecta- tions of multiple stakeholders in some sectors relative to others, we hypothesize that: Hypothesis 2: Industrial sector moderates the relationship between social perfor- mance and reputation, such that the relationship is stronger in sectors that are associated with salient social and environmental issues. Existing contributions have argued that understanding the wants of stakeholders is of primary importance when attempting to design organizational responses to them (Frooman, 1999), and that stakeholders are most likely to be galvanized into action in circumstances where they share a clear preference for a particular action in a context where the source of the concern is easily identiﬁable (Rowley and Berman, 2000). Therefore, it is likely that the overall reputational impact of social respon- siveness is jointly contingent upon which dimension of social responsiveness is under consideration, and which business sector the ﬁrm is primarily associated with. Existing evidence suggests that the nature of focal social issues varies systemati- cally across different industries. For example, earlier empirical work has identiﬁed a number of sectors as having particularly high environmental impacts, e.g. the metals, resources, paper and pulp, power generation, water, and chemicals sectors (Bowen, 2000; Clemens, 2001; Hoffman, 1999; Morris, 1997; Sharma, 1997; Sharma et al., 1999). Other industries are associated with alternative issues, for example, the tobacco and alcoholic drinks industries are associated with highly visible social issues. They are thought to produce large social externalities (e.g. crime and health) and are subject to strong regulatory regimes (competition, safety and taxation). Similarly, the defence and pharmaceutical industries receive particular attention from ethical pressure groups, and the proﬁle of workplace health and safety concerns is relatively high in the construction and resource extraction sectors. Since the reputational beneﬁts of improved social responsiveness arise out of meeting the expectations of stakeholders for the mitigation or reparation of social issues, it follows that demonstrating good social performance that is perceived to bear little or no relation to a ﬁrm’s activities may be thought of as wasteful managerial excess, and so harm reputation, whereas examples perceived as rel- evant are likely to be more favourably viewed. Hence, we hypothesize that the ﬁt between a corporation’s social performance activities and its business environment inﬂuences the link between social performance and reputation. Hypothesis 3: Industrial sector and type of social performance interact to inﬂu- ence the relationship between social performance and reputation, such that the link between reputation and community (employee; environmental) perfor- mance is stronger in sectors that are associated with salient social (employee; environmental) issues. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006 440 METHOD S. J. Brammer and S. Pavelin Our sample consists of 210 UK PLCs chosen largely according to the availability of reputation data (see below[1]). Therefore, this sample, while drawn from a wide range of industrial sectors, is not randomly selected. Instead, there is a focus upon the largest ﬁrms within each industrial sector, including 90 per cent of FTSE 100 companies. Nevertheless, there is considerable variation in reputational scores both within and between industrial sectors. Corporate Reputation To measure corporate reputation we utilize the ‘Britain’s most admired compa- nies’ survey from Management Today, 2002, which employs a similar methodology to that used to construct the Fortune index, a commonly-used measure of the reputa- tions of US ﬁrms (e.g. Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Fryxell and Wang, 1994; McGuire et al., 1988). The chairmen, managing directors and selected main board directors of the 10 largest companies in 24 industrial sectors were surveyed, as were analysts at a selection of leading investment companies. Participants were asked to rate each company in their sector (excluding their own company) on a scale of zero (poor) to 10 (excellent) for their performance in nine criteria: quality of manage- ment; ﬁnancial soundness; ability to attract, develop and retain top talent; quality of products/services; value as a long term investment; capacity to innovate; quality of marketing; community and environmental responsibility; and use of corporate assets. The assessments received for each ﬁrm were averaged across criteria and respondents to produce a single reputational score. Given our focus upon the role of social performance as a determinant, rather than component, of reputation, it would be preferable to remove a score for perceived social (community and environmental) responsiveness from these repu- tational scores. Unfortunately, we cannot do this. However, we believe that this component, which contributes only one ninth of the score, is dominated by other aspects of reputation. Furthermore, as mentioned previously, there is evidence that similarly constructed aggregated measures of reputation speak most directly to a ﬁrm’s reputation as an investment. Social Performance Social performance data were obtained from the Ethical Investment Research Service (EIRIS), who specialize in the measurement of corporate social perfor- mance against a consistent and objective set of criteria, principally for the con- sumption of investors. EIRIS survey ﬁrms concerning their social performance, but also undertake their own research. As a result, they are able to provide social performance scores for a ﬁrm irrespective of whether it participates in an EIRIS © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006 Corporate Reputation and Social Performance 441 survey. They offer the largest and most complete multidimensional social perfor- mance coverage of UK ﬁrms, covering issues relating to employment, the envi- ronment, community, human rights and supply chain management. Due to the limited availability of data regarding the last two of these, we will restrict our attention to the ﬁrst three dimensions of social performance. Our indicator of employee responsibility is based upon ﬁve separate components relating to health and safety systems, training and development, equal opportuni- ties practices, employee relations and job creation and security. Similarly, our indicator of environmental responsiveness is based upon four separate components relating to the quality of environmental policies, systems, reporting and perfor- mance. Our indicator of community responsiveness is entered as a single measure by EIRIS. Following the general approach used by Graves and Waddock (1994) for KLD data,[2] we translated the EIRIS text-grade rating for each measure into a number-grade rating. Each environmental measure has ﬁve text categories; the employment measures have three text categories, while community has four. We coded each of the environment text scales into ﬁve point scales, each of the employee responsibility text scales into three point scales and created a four point scale for community responsiveness. In each case, the codes began with a value of 1 and larger numbers indicated more social responsiveness. To summarize, our measures of the three dimensions of social performance are: • Community performance graded 1 to 4. • Environmental performance: policies; systems; reporting; and performance. Each category graded 1 to 5. Environmental impact score out of 20. • Employee performance: health and safety; training and development; equal opportunities; employee relations; job creation; and job security. Each cat- egory graded 1 to 3. Employment responsibility score out of 18. To arrive at a single aggregate measure (termed social performance) we summed the three scores having normalized each to a 1 to 4 grading. This generates an overall score out of 12. Control Variables Corporate reputation is partly formed by signals concerning current ﬁnancial performance whether such signals arise out of accounting data or stem from movements in stock prices (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). Strong ﬁnancial perfor- mance generally signals an effective corporate strategy, good management, and good resource allocations, and so helps a ﬁrm establish or maintain a good repu- tation (Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Sabate and Puente, 2003), particularly among groups of ﬁnancial stakeholders such as creditors, investors, and external analysts (Fama, 1970; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). While external agents view ﬁnancially successful companies favourably, they tend to be risk-averse. Therefore, if two © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006 442 S. J. Brammer and S. Pavelin ﬁrms exhibit similar levels of ﬁnancial performance, it should be the ﬁrm that appears to offer less risk that gains the better reputation (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). In addition, a higher degree of leverage should, ceteris paribus, bring lower reputational assessments, as it constitutes a burden upon future returns that may threaten the medium- and/or long-term viability of the ﬁrm. A measure of each ﬁrm’s proﬁtability (measured by the ratio of pre-tax proﬁts to total assets) and corporate leverage (measured by the ratio of total debt to total assets) were extracted from accounting data courtesy of DataStream. Data concern- ing the market performance of sample companies was obtained from Barra Inc., a leading risk specialist. We employ a b measure of the risks associated with stock ownership that gauges the expected response of a stock to the overall market. A b is an analytical tool, commonly employed by investors, to measure the volatility or risk of stocks. It measures the extent to which the price of a given stock varies with respect to the market as a whole. A b coefﬁcient is derived from a regression analysis that estimates the effect, over a period of time (say, ﬁve years), of weekly or monthly percentage changes in a market index on weekly or monthly percentage changes in the price of an individual stock. Broadly speaking, ﬁrms grow as a result of some measure of effectiveness in their corporate strategic history, and so larger ﬁrms should be expected to garner a better reputation than smaller rivals. Larger ﬁrms also tend to be more visible to external agents, i.e. agents will tend to hold more information regarding the activities of larger ﬁrms – an imbalance which may bias their assessments of corporate reputation. Also, media exposure not only increases the stock of avail- able information, but also sets the context within which it is viewed. For both reasons, one should expect the extent of media exposure to inﬂuence assessments of corporate reputation. A measure of each ﬁrm’s size (the natural logarithm of the value of total assets) was extracted from accounting data courtesy of DataStream. Many empirical studies employ ﬁrm size as a measure of visibility to external agents (e.g. Adams and Hardwick, 1998; Bowen, 2000; Damanpour, 1987). However, Bowen (2000) argues that size is an unsatisfactory proxy because it captures much more than an organization’s visibility. Regarding an alternative measure, Saiia (2000) argues for the use of readily available secondary data. Consistent with these arguments, our approach is to use the incidence of news media coverage of the ﬁrm as a measure of visibility.[3] This information was obtained form the Factiva database, which provides searchable archives of news content from over 8000 global sources. We gathered data for each of the calendar years 1998–2002 inclusive, and used the natural logarithm of the average number of annual news hits as our measure of corporate visibility. Recent evidence suggests that the composition of a ﬁrm’s shareholder constitu- ency, across a broad spectrum of investor groups, exerts a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on various aspects of ﬁrm behaviour. Institutional investors are motivated to become more engaged with corporate management because of their increased visibility and © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006 Corporate Reputation and Social Performance 443 because they are ‘tied in’ to their investments in the sense that, given their size, they have reduced ﬂexibility to sell investments without signiﬁcantly damaging their value (Ryan and Schneider, 2002). A strong presence of institutional shareholders may therefore signal to other stakeholders that the ﬁrm’s performance is keenly monitored and deemed to be satisfactory by these relatively well-informed and experienced investors. Ownership data were drawn in June 2002 from a share ownership analysis database of more than 2000 listed UK ﬁrms managed by one of the UK’s largest company registrars. Derived from records of share trading on the London Stock Exchange, the database disaggregates share ownership accord- ing to 32 different types of beneﬁcial owner. Following Ryan and Schneider (2002) and Johnson and Greening (1999), we employ a variable that equals the sum of the proportions of ﬁrm equity held by long-term institutional investor groups, i.e. pension funds, insurance companies and life assurors. A link has often been drawn between a ﬁrm’s reputation and the perceived quality of its product range, such that ﬁrms perceived to produce high quality goods tend to enjoy better reputations (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). In light of this, one should expect corporate reputation to be augmented by those activities most closely associated with the vertical differentiation of products: technological advancement and the cultivation of a strong brand image. Accordingly, we hypothesize that reputation is increasing in a ﬁrm’s research and development (R&D) and advertising intensities. A measure of each ﬁrm’s R&D intensity (the ratio of R&D expenditures to total assets) was extracted from accounting data courtesy of DataStream. As there is no statutory obligation to disclose such expen- ditures, ﬁrm-level advertising data are difﬁcult to obtain for UK ﬁrms. However, media research agencies monitor the incidence of advertisements at the brand level throughout the main advertising media (TV, newspapers, magazines, radio, posters, etc) and estimate the levels of expenditure incurred. We construct a dummy variable on the basis of identiﬁcation, by Marketing magazine in 2002, of a ﬁrm as one of the ‘Top 100 Advertisers’ or as an owner of one of the ‘Biggest Brands’ in the UK. Given that the levels of expenditure on advertising tail off dramatically at the foot of these rankings we are conﬁdent that our methodology allows us to capture the vast majority of the ﬁrms for which advertising is a key competitive tool. Finally, it may be that, even controlling for ﬁnancial performance and all the other ﬁrm attributes we have discussed, reputation varies systematically across sectors. This is to say, some business activities may predispose a ﬁrm to a better reputation than do other activities. Each ﬁrm’s principle business activity (approxi- mately equivalent to the three-digit NACE industry) was extracted from account- ing data courtesy of DataStream. Using the DataStream industry classiﬁcation, we allocated each ﬁrm to one of twelve sectors: business services, chemicals,[4] con- struction, consumer products, engineering, ﬁnance, high technology, publishing, resources, retail, transportation, and utilities. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006 444 RESULTS S. J. Brammer and S. Pavelin We present OLS regression results for an econometric model of corporate repu- tation that incorporates the explanatory variables described in the previous section. Table I presents descriptive statistics and a correlation matrix for key variables. Diagnostic testing provides evidence of heteroscedasticity in all but one of the regressions presented. In light of this, we employ White’s method to correct for bias in statistical inference. In the presence of heteroscedasticity, White’s method adjusts standard errors to facilitate the drawing of sound inferences concerning statistical signiﬁcance (White, 1980). We note that heteroscedasticity does not bias parameter estimates, but that more efﬁcient parameter estimates can be obtained through the use of either weighted least squares or MLE if the sources of the heteroscedasticity are identiﬁed. Unfortunately, we can make no such identiﬁca- tion. To test for simultaneity in the relationships between corporate reputation and both social performance and ﬁnancial performance, we carried out Durbin–Wu– Hausman tests as suggested in Davidson and MacKinnon (1993). In both cases, we found no evidence of simultaneity and conclude that the estimates provided by ordinary least squares are consistent. We ﬁrst present results that restrict social performance to a reputational effect that is the same in all sectors. We also impose the constraint that all types of social performance must have the same effect on reputation. Both of these restrictions are subsequently dropped as we progress towards our preferred model speciﬁcation. Selecting the Most Suitable Model Speciﬁcation Table II presents the results for three speciﬁcations. All three use a single measure of social performance. The ﬁrst omits the set of sectoral dummy variables that are included in the second and third regressions. The third also includes interaction between social performance and the sectoral dummies, thereby permitting the reputational effect of social performance to vary systematically across sectors. Regression 1 provides a point of departure with the existing literature by exam- ining a set of explanatory variables that overlaps considerably with those employed by Fombrun and Shanley (1990). Consistent with Fombrun and Shanley’s results, we ﬁnd that ﬁrm reputation is positively associated with current ﬁnancial perfor- mance, as measured by proﬁtability (p = 0.026), with the degree of long-term institutional ownership (p = 0.000), and negatively associated with market risk (p = 0.009). These results provide further conﬁrmation of the ﬁndings of Fryxell and Wang (1994) which suggest that reputational indices are highly correlated with facets of corporate ﬁnancial performance. In contrast with Fombrun and Shanley (1990), we ﬁnd corporate media visibility to have a signiﬁcant positive effect on reputation (p = 0.041). Taking these three regressions together, we can draw some conclusions about the suitability of each speciﬁcation.

Similarly, the inclusion of the interaction variables is justiﬁed by a number of signiﬁcant associated coefﬁcients in regression 3. Therefore, of the ﬁrst three regressions, the third seems to represent the most suitable speciﬁcation. Indeed, we note that as the speciﬁcation is developed by adding industry effects and interactions, the adjusted R-squared statistic rises from 0.206 to 0.403. The pattern identiﬁed across the sectoral dummy variables suggests, consistent with earlier observations, that it is important to control for industry in studies of corporate reputation, particularly when measures of reputation are industry-speciﬁc in the sense that respondents are asked to rate ﬁrms relative to industry peers (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). Table III also presents results for three speciﬁcations, but in each case social performance is disaggregated into its constituent parts. Following the same pattern as Table III, regression 4 omits a set of sectoral dummy variables that are included in regressions 5 and 6, the latter of which also includes interaction between the various dimensions of social performance and a selection of sectoral dummies. This selection was obtained from an iterative procedure, which began with each dimen- sion of social performance being interacted with all (but one) of the sectoral dummies (see the appendix for regression results for this full model). This speciﬁ- cation brought a huge increase in the number of parameters to be estimated (from 22 to 55). To recover some degrees of freedom, we undertook a process of reﬁne- ment that sought to isolate just those interactions for which evidence could be found. Accordingly, the least signiﬁcant of these interaction variables was omitted and the regression re-run. This procedure was repeated until all remaining inter- action variables were signiﬁcant at the 90 per cent level of conﬁdence. Only 9 of the 33 interactions secured a place in the ﬁnal speciﬁcation. Again, that signiﬁcant coefﬁcients are associated with a number of the sectoral dummy variables in regressions 5 and 6, and a number of the interaction variables in regression 6, justiﬁes their inclusion in both cases. As the speciﬁcation is devel- oped by adding industry effects and selected interactions, the adjusted R-squared statistic rises from 0.233 to 0.481. Therefore, of these three model speciﬁcations, it is that used in regression 6 that appears the most suitable. Furthermore, signiﬁcant variation across the various types of social performance (as shown in regressions 4, 5 and 6) indicates that regression 6 should be preferred to regression 3, and so is the most suitable of all the speciﬁcations presented – as reﬂected in its superior explanatory power relative to the other speciﬁcations. Regression 6 provides good evidence in support of roles in determining repu- tation played by a number of our control variables: ﬁnancial performance, market risk and long-term institutional ownership.[5] However, we ﬁnd no sig- niﬁcant roles for leverage, ﬁrm size, media exposure, R&D intensity and adver- tising intensity. As mentioned above, there is also strong evidence that reputation sectors. The greatest predisposition to a good varies systematically across © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006 448 S. J. Brammer and S.

DISCUSSION In describing our ﬁndings, we will of course ultimately draw upon the speciﬁcation we have selected as the most suitable. However, some lessons regarding the effect of social performance can be gleaned from the manner in which its effect varies across the regression results as a whole. For example, the ﬁrst regression attributes no signiﬁcant effect to social performance, but once reputation is permitted to vary systematically across sectors, there is evidence of a signiﬁcant role. Speciﬁcally, the second regression shows that, when taking all sectors together, reputation is increasing in social performance. However, the third regression shows that this relationship is subject to signiﬁcant cross-sector variation. Indeed, the signiﬁcant role is restricted to the chemicals, consumer products, ﬁnance, resources and transportation sectors, where the effect is positive in all cases. Regressions 4 and 5 imply that the signiﬁcance of social performance for repu- tation resides only within community performance. However, once the impact of the environmental and employee dimensions of social performance is permitted to vary across sectors (as reported in regression 6), both are found to have statistically signiﬁcant effects on reputation. Environmental performance is predicted to harm reputation (p = 0.019) in all but the chemicals, consumer products, resources and transportation sectors, where it has a positive reputational effect (p = 0.063, p = 0.006, p = 0.000, and p = 0.033, respectively). Three of these sectors (chemi- cals, resources, and transport) are commonly identiﬁed as industries with salient environmental issues within the environmental management literature (Bowen, 2000; Clemens, 2001; Halme and Huse, 1996; Sharma et al., 1999). Employee performance is predicted to inﬂuence reputation only in the resources sector, where it has a detrimental effect (p = 0.064). The comparatively low overall signiﬁcance of employee responsibility in regression 6 may reﬂect the fact that employee responsibility is, relative to other dimensions of social performance, comparatively invisible from outside the organization and therefore has only a muted impact on the impressions external agents have of companies. Alternatively, it may be that employee responsibilities play only a minor role in inﬂuencing reputations because they are associated with legal compliance issues to which all companies are subject. The positive overall effect of community performance, shown in regressions 4 and 5, is reﬂected in the results for regression 6 in all but one sector, resources, where there is a signiﬁcant negative effect (p = 0.000). Thus, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant positive impact of community responsiveness that operates in 11 of the 12 industrial sectors examined in our study. It is this dimension of CSR policy that exerts the inﬂuence on reputation that is most widely felt across industrial sectors. This signiﬁcant role for © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006 450 S. J. Brammer and S. Pavelin community involvement is consistent with the evidence for philanthropic expendi- tures identiﬁed by Fombrun and Shanley (1990) and Williams and Barrett (2000). Furthermore, while there is a general tendency for community performance to build reputation in these 11 sectors (p = 0.000), the greatest effect is found in two of them: Engineering (p = 0.023) and Finance (p = 0.000). We can use these ﬁndings to evaluate Hypotheses 1, 2, and 3. Regressions 3 and 6 provide evidence in support of Hypothesis 2 (that the relationship between social performance and reputation varies across sectors). Hypothesis 3 also receives support, as regressions 4, 5 and 6 indicate that this relationship varies across the types of social performance. As previously implied, we interpret this support for Hypotheses 2 and 3 as reason to select regression 6 as the most suitable for evaluation of the other hypotheses. The evidence relating to Hypothesis 1 is somewhat mixed. Hypothesis 1, that there is a positive reputational effect, receives support in respect of community performance in all but the resources sector, and for environmental performance in the chemicals, consumer products, resources and transportation sectors. However, there is a negative reputational effect for community performance in the resources sector, for environmental performance in all but the four sectors listed above, and for employee performance in the resources sector. It is worth reﬂecting upon how these ﬁndings relate to our previous discussion concerning the perceived relatedness of social performance to the activities of the ﬁrm. Consistency with that discussion would imply: that community performance is perceived to be keenly relevant in all but the resources sector; that environmental performance is primarily associated with the chemicals, consumer products, resources and transportation sectors; and that no activity is perceived to be closely related to employee performance. In response, we note, somewhat tentatively, that the resources sector operates without close proximity to ﬁnal consumers, and that there is signiﬁcant environmental impact in, at least some parts of, the chemicals, consumer products, resources and transportation sectors. CONCLUSION Using data on a sample of large UK ﬁrms, we present a model of corporate reputation. The analysis focuses upon the relationship between corporate social performance and reputation and is distinctive in two respects. First, we differ- entiate between overall corporate social performance and its constituent parts. Second, the varying inﬂuence of these factors on ﬁrm reputation across industries is examined. We ﬁnd that different types of social performance have varying reputational impacts and that these impacts are contingent upon which industry the ﬁrm operates in. In ﬁnding that social performance inﬂuences corporate reputation, we echo the ﬁndings of previous work and provide further support for the notion that © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006 Corporate Reputation and Social Performance 451 social responsibility inﬂuences a ﬁrm’s market valuation. However, we reveal signiﬁcant variation in this reputational effect across business activities and various dimensions of social performance. In particular, our results demonstrate the need to achieve a ‘ﬁt’ between the type of corporate social performance and the ﬁrm’s stakeholder environment. For example, a strong record of environmental performance may enhance or damage reputation depending on whether the ﬁrm’s activities ‘ﬁt’ with environmental concerns in the eyes of stakeholders. Community involvement, by contrast, shown to have a more generally positive impact upon corporate reputations, suggesting that good community performance is expected by stakeholders in almost all industrial contexts. is Given the competitive importance of social responsibility and reputation, our work is suggestive of a need to explore the role the concept of ‘ﬁt’ plays in determining the effectiveness of social responsibility initiatives. Our results suggest that ‘ﬁtting’ social performance to an industrial context implies good performance in areas where stakeholders hold a general expectation of companies, such as seems to be true of community performance, and demonstrating sensitivity to any industry-speciﬁc issues, such as environmental impacts. Recognizing the impor- tance of ‘ﬁt’ may help to resolve the inconclusive ﬁndings in the literature con- cerning the relationship between social performance and ﬁnancial performance (Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997). Much of the literature regarding corporate reputation has centred on empiri- cal study of US ﬁrms. Our analysis contributes to the small, but growing, body of work focused upon other countries (e.g. Kitchen and Laurence, 2003; Mac- Millan et al., 2002; Wiedmann, 2002) and offers an opportunity to examine the international robustness of US ﬁndings. Broadly, our results are consistent with earlier work in that we ﬁnd reputation to be affected by a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial per- formance, market risk, the extent of long-term institutional ownership, and the nature of its business activities. These results suggest that the determinants of reputation, derived from the assessments of managers and market analysts, are relatively robust across countries. This study suffers from limitations that could be addressed in future work (see also Heugens, 2004). First, our analysis is cross-sectional in nature and future attempts to examine the patterns we have identiﬁed within a longitudinal frame- work would both help to resolve remaining issues concerning causality and shed more light on the evolving relationship between philanthropy and reputation among UK ﬁrms. Second, our study, in common with much of the empirical work in the area conducted in the UK, would beneﬁt from an improved avail- ability of data, particularly regarding corporate reputation. We would welcome time-series reputational data for a consistent and large sample of companies, derived from alternative methodologies, such as those proposed by Gardberg and Fombrun (2002). © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2006 452 NOTES S. J. Brammer and S. Pavelin [1] We have reputation data for 240 ﬁrms. However, restricted availability of other data (principally regarding institutional ownership) necessitated the loss of 30 of these ﬁrms from the sample. [2] Kinder, Lindenberg, Domini and Company (KLD) are a social choice investment advisory ﬁrm that objectively rates (mainly US) ﬁrms on nine dimensions of social performance. [3] The chemicals sector includes pharmaceuticals. We tested the sensitivity of our ﬁndings to this aggregation and found the omission of pharmaceutical companies from the chemicals sector brought no material change in the results. [4] Meznar and Nigh (1995) adopt a similar approach to measuring organizational visibility. They measured visibility as the number of stories concerning a ﬁrm in ﬁve US national daily newspa- pers over a 15 month period. [5] The statistical signiﬁcance of each of these ﬁndings is indicated by the following p values: 0.078, 0.001 and 0.000, respectively.
