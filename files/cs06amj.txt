COLLINS  Cornell University  KEN G. SMITH  University of Maryland  In this study, we developed and tested a theory of how human resource practices affect  the organizational social climate conditions that facilitate knowledge exchange and  combination and resultant firm performance. A field study of 136 technology compa  nies showed that commitment-based human resource practices were positively related  to the organizational social climates of trust, cooperation, and sharea codes and  language. In turn, these measures of a firm's social climate were related to the firm's  capability to exchange and combine knowledge, a relationship that predicted firm  revenue from new products and services and firm sales growth.  There is a widely held belief that an organiza  tion's survival and success are at least partially  dependent on the effort, behaviors, and interac  tions of employees as they carry out the mission  and strategy of the firm (Wright & McMahan, 1992).  Strategic human resource scholars have argued that  companies can effectively influence the interac  tions, behaviors, and motivation of employees  through different human resource (HR) practices  (Huselid, 1995; Wright, Dunford, & Snell, 2001). In  this regard, two HR practice alternatives have  emerged in the literature: transaction-based HR  practices, which emphasize individual short-term  exchange relationships, and commitment-based HR  practices, which focus on mutual, long-term ex  change relationships (Arthur, 1992; Tsui, Pearce,  Porter, & Hite, 1995). Thus, a central issue that  companies must resolve involves choosing and im  plementing the HR practices that best facilitate or  ganizational success.  To that end, a growing body of evidence suggests  that commitment-based HR practices are more pos  We would like to thank Scott Snell, Rosemary Batt,  and George Milkovich for providing us with helpful com  ments on drafts of this paper.

For example, re  searchers have found a positive relationship  between more commitment-based HR practices and  firm performance in manufacturing firms (Arthur,  1992, 1994; MacDuffie, 1995; Youndt, Snell, Dean,  & Lepak, 1996), in service organizations (Batt,  2002), and in a diversified sample of businesses  (Huselid, 1995). Although the specific HR practices  applied vary across studies, companies following a  commitment-based approach implement practices  that collectively demonstrate a long-term invest  ment in their employees (Tsui, Pearce, Porter, &  Tripoli, 1997). The exact individual HR practices  that create a commitment-based environment differ  across companies and studies, but they generally  include a combination of employee selection prac  tices that focus on creating internal labor markets  and assessing fit to the company rather than on  specific job requirements; compensation practices  that focus employee motivation on group and or  ganizational performance indicators; and training  programs and performance appraisals that empha  size long-term growth, team building, and the de  velopment of firm-specific knowledge (Arthur,  1992; Tsui et al., 1997).  Although commitment-based HR practices ap  pear to be related to firm performance, little re  search has empirically explored the causal mecha  nisms through which these HR practices lead to  greater firm performance (Becker & Gerhart, 1996;  Wright et al., 2001). The literature suggests that  commitment-based HR practices create an organi  zational social climate that motivates employees to This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:27:28 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2006 Collins and Smith 545  act in the best interests of their firm rather than  only in their individual self-interest (Rousseau,  1995; Tsui et al., 1995). This view closely  matches the perspective of research on strategic  human resource management (SHRM), which  suggests that commitment-based HR practices af  fect firm performance by creating an organization  al environment that elicits employee behaviors  and capabilities that contribute to firm competi  tive advantage (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004; Collins &  Clark, 2003). Some initial empirical research sug  gests that positive employee relations affect firm  performance by creating positive employee atti  tudes (Fulmer, Gerhart, & Scott, 2003), yet there  is a need to examine how commitment-based HR  practices influence the broader social context,  such as a firm's social climate. Our first goal was  to develop and test theory about how commit  ment-based HR practices affect the organizational  social climate that motivates employees to work  together to generate new knowledge and subse  quent firm performance.  Researchers exploring this mediated model must  be careful in identifying the social climates important  for the companies in their samples, because the social  climate conditions that drive performance will likely  vary with the industry conditions those companies  face (Collins & Clark, 2003; Fulmer et al., 2003). Fur  ther, previous firm-level HR studies have focused on  companies facing relatively stable business condi  tions and technologies (e.g., auto manufacturing  plants, steel mini-mills), but these studies provide  little guidance on the role of commitment-based HR  practices in firms facing more dynamic environ  ments. Importantly, firms in rapidly changing indus  tries derive their primary competitive advantage  through the ability of their employees to create and  manage knowledge (Bettis & Hitt, 1995; Grant,  1996). Therefore, there is a need to understand  how commitment-based HR systems can facilitate  the exchange and combination of ideas and  knowledge among employees (Smith, Collins, &  Clark, 2005). Our second goal was to examine  how commitment-based HR practices affect firm  performance in rapidly changing environments.  Most research on commitment-based HR prac  tices has focused on lower-level workers (e.g., call  center operators, manufacturing line employees),  ignoring how these practices affect other types of  employees (Lepak & Snell, 1999). This is an impor  tant issue because firms are composed of multiple  types of employees who are managed differently  and who impact performance in different ways  (Lepak & Snell, 1999). All employees may create  some value, but companies in dynamic industries  may be especially dependent on the ability of  knowledge workers, such as scientists and engi  neers, to exchange and combine information in  new ways (Grant, 1996; Huber, 2004). For example,  Appleyard and Brown (2001) found evidence that  engineers played a greater role in the success of  semiconductor firms than did line employees. Our  third objective was to examine how commitment  based HR practices influence key knowledge .work  ers, those who are likely to have the greatest impact  on firm performance through knowledge exchange  and combination.  To foreshadow our arguments and highlight our  contribution, we elaborate a model of how commit  ment-based HR practices affect knowledge ex  change and combination and ensuing firm perfor  mance through organizational social climates.  Figure 1 contains this model. We begin by defining  commitment-based HR practices and theoretically  linking them to the organizational social climate  factors that may drive knowledge exchange and  combination. Next, we draw on theory from the  knowledge creation literature and the knowledge  based view of the firm to theoretically connect or  ganizational social climates to firm performance  through their effects on knowledge exchange and  combination. Finally, we extend the application of  commitment-based practices to a new context and  type of worker by examining the effects of these HR  practices on a sample of knowledge workers from  136 high-technology firms.

Within this literature, a consensus exists  that companies can manage the employer-em  ployee relationship and motivate employees  through HR practices with a commitment orienta  tion (Rousseau, 1995; Tsui et al., 1997). This com  mitment-based approach emphasizes the imple  mentation of a combination of HR practices that  work together to motivate employees to contribute  high levels of discretionary behaviors by aligning  their interests with those of the organizations and  creating a mutually reinforcing high-investment  employer-employee relationship (Arthur, 1992;  Tsui et al., 1997).  Practices that an organization may adopt to  create this type of employment relationship in  clude recruitment and selection to create growth  opportunities for employees through internal la  bor markets and identifying external candidates  who are a fit to the company (Delery & Doty,  1996; Tsui et al., 1997); organization- or team  based compensation designed to increase knowl  edge sharing and commitment to the organization  (Delaney & Huselid, 1996; Delery & Doty, 1996);  and training and performance appraisal that en  able employee growth and development and  build firm-specific knowledge (Arthur, 1992;  Youndt et al., 1996). By demonstrating high in  vestment in employees, commitment-based HR  practices increase employees' motivations to  contribute the behaviors and acquire the firm  specific knowledge required to support their  company's strategy (Rousseau, 1995).  Although a growing body of studies has provided  evidence of a relationship between commitment  based HR practices and firm performance, much  less is known about the mechanisms through  which these HR practices affect firm performance  (Wright et al., 2001). However, researchers have  begun to argue that commitment-based HR prac  tices don't directly impact performance, but in  stead foster social climates that facilitate the devel  opment of employee-based capabilities?such as  the ability to combine and exchange information to  create new knowledge?that in turn create compet  itive advantage (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004; Collins &  Clark, 2003). Recent empirical work also seems to  support the notion that HR practices affect firm  performance through employee attitudes (Fulmer  et al., 2003) and capabilities (Collins & Clark, 2003).  Building on this work, we examine how commit  ment-based HR practices facilitate the development  of firmwide social climate that encourages the ex  change and combination of knowledge among  knowledge workers.  As competition among technology-based firms  has increased, the source of competitive advantage  in these firms has migrated from tangible resources  and market power to knowledge and know-how  (Grant, 1996; Huber, 2004). In addition, the ability  to create new knowledge is a firm-specific resource  that can yield new revenue-producing opportuni  ties and enable firms to respond effectively to rap  idly shifting environments (DeCarolis & Deeds,  1999; Grant, 1996). Given the importance of knowl  edge creation, scholars have begun to study how  firms can develop this unique competency (Argote,  McEvily, & Reagans, 2003). Nahapiet and Ghoshal  (1998) argued that new knowledge is created  within organizations through the process of ex  change and combination among employees. Im  plicit in this argument is the notion that exchange  and combination create new knowledge by con  necting previously unconnected ideas and knowl  edge or recombining previously connected ideas  and knowledge in novel ways (Kogut & Zander,  1992; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998).  Further, the social climate of a firm?employees'  shared beliefs regarding the norms and values that  govern interactions among them as they carry out  their jobs (Ashkanasy, Wilderom, & Peterson,  2000)?can affect employees' abilities, motiva  tions, and opportunities to exchange and combine  their knowledge (Argote et al., 2003; Kogut &  Zander, 1992). In particular, relational aspects of  organizational social climate, such as trust, cooper  ation, and shared language, are key mechanisms  that enable employees to exchange and recombine  knowledge (Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998; Smith et al.,  2005). Creating a social climate that facilitates  knowledge sharing may be particularly crucial for  high-technology companies as their employees of  ten see knowledge as a source of power and job  security, a perception that makes them unwilling to  share tacit knowledge with other employees (Dav  enport & Prusak, 1998). In particular, researchers  have argued that firm social climate may encourage  employees to focus on the larger community of the  organization rather than on their own best interests,  thus facilitating knowledge exchange and combina  tion (e.g., Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998; Reagans &  McEvily, 2003).

Following  Ashkanasy et al. (2000) and Smith et al. (2005), we  defined social climate as the collective set of  norms, values, and beliefs that express employees'  views of how they interact with one another while  carrying out tasks for their firm. Below, we argue  that commitment-based HR selection, training and  development, and incentive practices will affect  social climates for trust, cooperation, and shared  codes and language. In turn, we expect that a social  climate for trust, cooperation, and shared codes  and language will facilitate knowledge exchange  and combination.  Trust. Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman defined  trust as "the willingness of a party to be vulnerable  to the actions of another party based on the expec  tation that the other will perform a particular action  important to the trustor, irrespective of the ability  to monitor or control that other party" (1995: 712).  They suggested that trust is rooted in three interre  lated components: ability (belief that the other is  capable and skilled), benevolence (desire to do  good for the other), and integrity (belief that the  other is motivated by principles of fairness). Al  though trust can vary according to individual dif  ferences in the propensity to support and believe in  others (Mayer et al., 1995), we contend that that a  social climate of trust may be influenced by a firm's  HR practices.  Commitment-based HR practices foster higher  trust between employees by implementing group  based incentives and providing training and devel  opment opportunities for greater communication  and interaction. More specifically, compensation  based on firm or group outcomes should be effec  tive in aligning employees' actions with organiza  tional goals (Milkovich, 1987) and ensuring that  people work together (Lawler, Mohrman, & Led  ford, 1995). Over time, group- or organiza  tion-based incentives may increase the perceived  integrity and trust of others as employees develop  norms that recognize contributions and impose  sanctions for social loafing (Leana & Van Buren,  1999). Employees are also more likely to trust one  another if they have interacted with or had the  chance to work with one another (Whitener, Brodt,  Korsgaard, & Werner, 1998). Importantly, commit  ment-based practices such as internal promotion  policies, job rotation, and team-based work design  increase the chances for such exposure. In addi  tion, performance appraisals that focus on em  ployee development provide opportunities for em  ployees to be seen by others as capable.  Cooperation. Following Wagner (1995), we de  fined a social climate for cooperation as the organ  izational norms that emphasize personal effort to  ward group outcomes or tasks as opposed to  individual outcomes. As with trust, we expected  commitment-based HR practices to increase the  norms for cooperation between knowledge work  ers. Specifically, team-based work design and or  ganization-based compensation and rewards en  courage employees to focus on organizational and  team accomplishments, thus increasing the preva  lence of shared values and goals (Arthur, 1992;  Tsui et al., 1997). When employees share a com  mon purpose and goals, they are more likely to  cooperate with one another to achieve those goals  (Wagner, 1995).  Shared codes and language. Shared codes and  language comprise a common set of terms, symbols,  and understandings that allow individuals to com  municate effectively with one another (Nahapiet &  Ghoshal, 1998). As with other aspects of social  climate, we expected commitment-based HR prac  tices to facilitate and support shared codes and  language among knowledge workers. Internal de  velopment opportunities such as cross-training,  promotion from within, and mentoring facilitate  the development of shared language among em  ployees by exposing them to the jargon and per  spectives used by different functional areas and  levels of their firm (Noe, 1999). Individuals are also  more willing to develop firm-specific skills such as  shared language when they receive reciprocal in  vestment from the firm (Rousseau, 1995). Practices  such as investment in training and development,  company-wide social events, and internal promo  tion opportunities demonstrate a company's invest  ment in employees, increasing individuals' will  ingness to develop firm-specific skills (MacDuffie,  1995) as well as increasing the degree of under  standing among employee groups.  Hypothesis 1. Commitment-based HR practices  are positively related to an organization's so  cial climates for trust, cooperation, and shared  codes and language.  Social Climate, Knowledge Exchange and  Combination, and Firm Performance  The ability to create new knowledge, which en  ables firms both to innovate and to outperform their  rivals in dynamic environments (Grant, 1996;  Kogut & Zander, 1992), results from the collective This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:27:28 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  548 Academy of Management Journal June  ability of employees to exchange and combine  knowledge (Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998). Further,  characteristics of firm social environment facilitate  such exchange and combination (Kogut & Zander,  1992; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998). Below, we out  line the specific relationships between organiza  tional social climate, knowledge exchange and  combination, and firm performance that we tested  in this study.  A social climate of trust is widely seen as essen  tial for increasing interaction and the likelihood of  information exchange between individuals (Mayer  et al., 1995; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998). For exam  ple, trust reflects a trustor's belief that a trustee will  not act opportunistically (Bradach & Eccles, 1989),  increasing their willingness to share valuable or  proprietary information. Trust also enhances the  likelihood of exchange of information and ideas  because trustworthy social conditions enhance ac  tors' beliefs that a current exchange will lead to  later reciprocation (Coleman, 1990). High levels of  trust also increase employees' tendencies to seek  and offer help, increasing the chances for exchange  (Jones & George, 1998). A social climate of trust  should promote the exchange of valuable ideas be  tween core knowledge workers that will, in turn,  lead to greater innovation and firm growth. In con  trast, when trust among employees is low, individ  uals will be cautious about exchanging information  and ideas with one another, and firm performance  will suffer.  Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998) suggested that co  operation between employees is a key aspect of  firm social climate that drives knowledge exchange  and combination processes. A climate for coopera  tion limits competition between employees and in  creases their willingness to share critical informa  tion with one another (Szulanski, 1996). Research  also suggests that creativity is enhanced when the  level of cooperation between members of a team is  high (Amabile, 1996; Tushman & O'Reilly, 1997).  Therefore, a strong climate for cooperation between  knowledge workers will positively affect firm per  formance by increasing the exchange of valuable  and unique information among them.  Although a climate of trust and cooperation may  increase the likelihood that exchange will take  place, shared codes and language facilitate both  access to information and integration of exchanged  knowledge. For example, differences in language  reduce the likelihood of exchange between individ  uals (Boland & Tenkasi, 1998; Nahapiet & Ghoshal,  1998). More importantly, from the perspective of  absorptive capacity, a degree of shared knowledge  or understanding is essential for individuals to  comprehend and integrate new knowledge that is  acquired from exchange with other employees (Co  hen & Levinthal, 1990; Hansen, 2002). A climate for  shared codes and language provides a common  base of understanding through which individuals  with disparate experience, knowledge, and back  grounds can transfer and integrate new ideas (Szu  lanski, 1996). Therefore, a greater level of shared  codes and language between knowledge workers  will positively affect the performance of high-tech  nology firms by facilitating knowledge exchange  and combination among knowledge workers.  Hypothesis 2. Organizational social climates for  trust, cooperation, and shared codes and lan  guage are positively related to firm performance  (revenue from new products and services and  one-year sales growth) through their effects on  knowledge exchange and combination.  The Mediated Effect of Commitment-Based HR  Practices on Firm Performance  As discussed above, one assumption underlying  research on SHRM is that commitment-based HR  practices do not affect performance directly.  Rather, these practices lead to higher performance  when they develop the organizational social cli  mate and employee-based capabilities that are im  portant for firm performance (Bowen & Ostroff,  2004; Collins & Clark, 2003). We argue that com  mitment-based HR practices affect firm perfor  mance through their effects on organizational so  cial climates and on knowledge exchange and  combination among knowledge workers. Commit  ment-based HR practices, however, are likely to  affect firm performance in other ways as well (Del  ery & Doty, 1996). For example, Huselid (1995)  argued that HR practices affect firm performance by  attracting or developing higher levels of human  capital and employee motivation. Thus, we predict  that organizational social climate and knowledge  exchange and combination will only partially me  diate the relationship between HR practices and  firm performance.  Hypothesis 3. Commitment-based HR practices  partially affect employee knowledge exchange  and combination and subsequent firm perfor  mance through organizational social climates  for trust, cooperation, and shared codes and  language.  METHODS  Overview of the Research Process  During a ten-month period in 1999 and 2000, we  gathered data from knowledge-intensive firms in This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:27:28 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2006 Collins and Smith 549  two regions of the United States characterized as  high-technology hot spots. To test our hypotheses,  we measured four sets of constructs: commitment  based HR practices, organizational social climates,  organizational knowledge exchange and combina  tion, and firm performance. We limited problems  associated with common method variance by col  lecting measures of the independent, mediating,  and dependent variables from different data  sources. Specifically, we used surveys of human  resource managers to assess commitment-based HR  practices; surveys of core knowledge workers to  estimate social climate and knowledge exchange  and combination; and interviews with CEOs and  public corporate records to measure firm perfor  mance. Further, we collected measures of firm per  formance for the one-year period 2000-01 after  collecting the data on the independent variables.  Sample and Research Procedures  We included only high-technology firms, defined  as companies that "emphasize invention and inno  vation in their business strategy, deploy a signifi  cant percentage of their financial resources to R&D,  employ a relatively high percentage of scientists  and engineers in their workforce, and compete in  worldwide, short-life-cycle product markets"  (Milkovich, 1987: 80). Our second criterion was  firm size: we contacted firms employing more than  100 employees to focus on firms that were most  likely to have formally established HR systems  (Huselid, 1995). Finally, we included firms in our  study only if they had publicly available financial  information on sales growth. As part of the study,  we conducted interviews with the CEOs of partic  ipating firms to ensure that their companies con  formed to these criteria.  Using two business publications that profiled re  gional high-technology firms, we compiled a list of  513 companies that met the above criteria. One  publication profiled technology firms in the Wash  ington, DC, region, and one profiled technology  firms in Austin, Texas. We dropped 116 companies  (23%) from the original sample because they were  either no longer in business, had diversified to  acquire nontechnology businesses, or had been ac  quired by other firms. Of the remaining 397 firms,  143 agreed to participate in the study. Missing data  on some variables reduced the sample to 136 com  panies (a 34 percent participation rate). Organiza  tions that agreed to participate did not differ from  nonparticipating firms in reported sales (i211 =  1.25, n.s.) or number of employees [t211 - 1.53,  n.s.). Company size had a mean of 502 employees,  with a standard deviation of 461, and it ranged  from 110 to 1,360 employees. Our final sample of  companies was drawn from six high-technology  industries: software, telecommunications, informa  tion technology consulting, computer electronics,  pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.  During an interview, we asked the CEO of each  participating company to identify a senior HR man  ager and up to 15 core knowledge workers, defined  as employees "critical for creating new knowledge  or developing innovations within your organiza  tion." To increase participation within firms, we  included signed endorsements from their CEOs  with each survey sent to employees. One human  resource manager participated from each company,  for an overall internal participation rate of 100 per  cent. An average of 7.72 core knowledge workers  completed surveys at each company; the range was  3 to 15 respondents, and the overall internal par  ticipation rate was 61 percent. These respondents  held the following jobs: 47 percent were engineers,  21 percent were software developers, 17 percent  were scientists, 9 percent were consultants, and 6  percent were project managers, suggesting that our  sample of respondents held jobs directly related to  knowledge creation.  Variables  Commitment-based HR practices. Procedures  used by Delery (1998) and by MacDuffie (1995)  were used in the theoretical development of our  measure of commitment-based HR practices from a  set of commitment-based HR practices focused on  training and development, compensation, and se  lection practice items. We adapted items from  previous research or developed them through inter  views with HR managers and CEOs of high-tech  nology companies to capture practices specific to  managing knowledge workers in technology com  panies. Specifically, we adapted items from Delery  and Doty (1996), who assessed an external market  based approach versus an internal commitment  based approach, and from Youndt and coauthors  (1996), who assessed a transactional approach ver  sus a human-capital-enhancing (i.e., commitment  based approach). We asked three HR managers  from high-tech firms similar to those in our sample  to assess the wording and appropriateness of the  items that we developed. The HR manager at each  participating company was asked to rate the extent  to which he or she agreed (1 = "strongly disagree,"  5 = "strongly agree") that the company used vari  ous HR practices to manage knowledge workers  similar to those identified by the CEO of the  company.  Overall, we used 16 items representing three sub This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:27:28 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  550 Academy of Management Journal June  dimensions to measure commitment-based HR  practices: internal labor markets and selection  based on fit to the company; group- and organiza  tion-based incentives; and training programs and  performance appraisals based on long-term growth,  team building, and development of firm-specific  knowledge. Appendix A gives our specific items.  Although the 16 items reflected three subdimen  sions of commitment-based HR practices, we found  support for a single commitment-based HR factor,  which we labeled "commitment-based HR prac  tices." More specifically, we conducted a principal  components factor analysis with varimax rotation  and found that all 16 items loaded on a single factor  with an eigenvalue of 9.51. Second, we found that  the scale also showed good reliability [a = .87). A  high score on this factor reflects a high use of com  mitment-based HR practices to manage the employ  er-employee relationship for key knowledge work  ers; a low score reflects a low use of commitment  based HR practices.  Finally, to provide additional evidence of con  struct validity, we examined the relationship be  tween our measure of HR practices and indicators  of a mutually committed employer-employee rela  tionship. Specifically, a company that has created  an employment relationship characterized by mu  tual investment on the parts of company and em  ployees should have lower turnover and higher  tenure among employees than a company that has  created a relationship based on a short-term out  look and economic exchange. We found that com  mitment-based HR practices were negatively corre  lated with employee turnover (r=-.57,p<.01),  measured as the number of employees that had  voluntarily left in the past year, as reported by the  HR managers. Further, we found that commitment  based HR practices were positively correlated with  employee tenure (r = .63, p < .01), measured as  average years of company work experience, col  lected from the knowledge worker surveys.  Organizational social climate. We collected  measures of social climate through surveys of  knowledge workers. For each set of items below,  knowledge workers were asked to assess the degree  to which they agreed (1 = "strongly disagree," 5 =  "strongly agree") with each statement. Because we  were interested in firm-level effects, we worded all  items on the knowledge worker surveys to reflect  organization-level constructs. In addition, we ex  amined intraclass correlations (ICCs) before aggre  gating these measures to the firm level (Bliese,  1998).  Trust. We measured climate for trust with a 12  item scale adapted from Mayer and Davis (1999).  The scale included 4 items for each of the three  dimensions of trust identified by Mayer et al.  (1995): ability, benevolence, and integrity. We mea  sured ability with 4 items assessing the degree to  which respondents believed that other knowledge  workers were capable and skilled (e.g., "Our em  ployees feel confident about each others' skills").  We measured benevolence with 4 items assessing  the extent to which respondents felt knowledge  workers in the company wanted to do good toward  each other (e.g., "The employees in this organiza  tion will go out of their way to help each other with  work"). We measured integrity with 4 items assess  ing the extent to which respondents felt knowledge  workers behaved fairly with each other (e.g., "Em  ployees in this organization try hard to be fair in  their dealings with one another"). The 12-item  scale showed good reliability [a = .91). ICCs for the  aggregated index (ICC[1] = .24, ICC[2] = .72) ex  ceeded levels suggested by Bliese (1998); therefore,  we averaged responses for the knowledge workers  in each firm to create an aggregated measure.  Cooperation. We measured the climate for coop  eration with a six-item scale adapted from Chatman  and Flynn (2001). Sample items included, "There  is little collaboration between employees at this  company" (reverse-scored), "Employees here are  willing to sacrifice their self-interests for the bene  fit of the group," and "There is a high level of  sharing between employees in this organization."  The scale demonstrated high reliability [a - .88).  ICCs for the aggregated index (ICC[1] = .26, ICC[2]  = .74) exceeded levels suggested by Bliese (1998);  therefore, we averaged the responses for knowledge  workers within each firm to estimate cooperation.  Shared codes and language. To measure the  climate for shared codes and language, we devel  oped five items based on Nahapiet and Ghoshal  (1997). Sample items included, "Employees are al  ways on the same page when they talk about work"  and "Employees in this company have trouble un  derstanding each other when working together on a  project" (reverse-scored). The scale demonstrated  high reliability [a = .84). ICCs for the aggregated  index (ICC[1] = .26, ICC[2] = .70) exceeded levels  suggested by Bliese (1998); therefore, we averaged  the responses across knowledge workers within  each firm to estimate the extent of the shared codes  and language between knowledge workers.  Knowledge exchange/combination. As noted  above, the likelihood of knowledge exchange and  combination among employees is dependent upon  employee motivation and ability (Argote et al.,  2003; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998). Therefore, we  measured knowledge exchange/combination with  an eight-item scale, given in Appendix B, that as  sessed knowledge workers' beliefs that exchange This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:27:28 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2006 Collins and Smith 551  and combination would yield personal or organiza  tional value (motivation) and the extent to which  they believed that employees could exchange and  combine information (ability). The Appendix lists  specific items. These items were developed in sev  eral brainstorming sessions and were prescreened  for wording and appropriateness with MBA stu  dents and current managers who had high-tech  work experience. We asked knowledge workers  to assess the extent to which they agreed with  each statement, using the same scale noted above.  Scale reliability [a = .91) and ICC values for the  aggregated index (ICC[1] = .24, ICC[2] = .72)  were good (Bliese, 1998); therefore, we averaged  responses for respondents within each firm to  estimate knowledge exchange/combination.  We collected the measures of organizational so  cial climate and knowledge exchange and combi  nation through surveys of knowledge workers;  therefore, we used confirmatory factor analysis to  test for construct distinctiveness. We used individ  ual-level data in these tests in order to have enough  observations for data stability. Chi-square differ  ence tests indicated that a four-factor model (cli  mates for trust, cooperation, shared codes and lan  guage, and knowledge exchange/combination)  showed reasonable fit to the data (model x2=  1,614.51, df = 224; CFI = .88, IFI = .88; LISREL  GFI = .86). Further, the chi-square difference tests  indicated that the four-factor model was a better fit  to the data than (1) a one-factor model [Ax2 =  1,666.68, df=6,p< .01) or (2) a two-factor model  in which the organizational social climate items  were one factor and knowledge exchange and com  bination items were a second factor (A^2 =  1,232.41, df= 5, p < .01).  Firm performance. We measured firm perfor  mance as both revenue from new products and  services and one-year sales growth, because these  are good indicators of the extent to which high  technology firms have been able to innovate and  create new knowledge. We collected our measure  of revenue from new products or services through a  follow-up survey sent to each CEO one year after  the original data collection. We asked each CEO to  identify the percentage of sales for the past year  that was driven by the sales of products or services  released in the that year. We collected our measure  of one-year sales growth from COMPUSTAT for the  year following the date of collection of HR manager  and knowledge worker surveys.  Control variables. Because firms may be more  able to innovate when they have greater resources  (Autio, Sapienza, & Almeida, 2000), we controlled  for firm size using a natural logarithmic transfor  mation of the number of full-time employees. We  also controlled for the number of office locations,  because employees may be less willing or able to  share knowledge when they are more geographi  cally dispersed. Firms in our sample were drawn  from six different high-technology industries that  likely face different market conditions. Therefore,  we controlled for industry differences with effects  coding in the regression analyses (we included five  dummy codes, with semiconductors as the omitted  industry).

Next, we used ordinary least squares regression  analysis to test each of our hypotheses. As shown  in models 2, 4, and 6 of Table 2, we found that our  measure of commitment-based HR was signifi  cantly related to a climate of trust (? = .47, p < .01),  cooperation (? = .48, p < .01), and shared codes  and language (? = .43, p < .01) after controlling for  company size, number of locations, and industry.  Thus, we found support for Hypothesis 1: commit  ment-based HR practices were positively related to  the organizational social climate conditions that  guide knowledge workers' interactions with one  another.  We present the regression results with knowl  edge exchange and combination as the dependent  variable in Table 3. First, as shown in model 2 of  Table 3, we found that our measure of commit  ment-based HR was significantly related to knowl  edge exchange and combination among knowledge  workers (? = .48, p < .01). Next, as shown in model  3 of Table 3, we added the social climate variables  (trust, cooperation, and shared codes and language)  and found that the relationship between commit  ment-based HR practices and knowledge exchange/  combination was dramatically reduced but still sig  nificant (? = .20, p < .05). In addition, trust (? =  .28, p < .01), cooperation (? = .32, p < .01), and  shared.codes and language (? = .21, p < .01) were  all significantly related to knowledge exchange and  combination. Overall, we found that the relation  ship between commitment-based HR practices and  knowledge exchange and combination was reduced  by 58 percent when the three social climate vari  ables were added to the regression equation. Thus,  we found support for Hypothesis 2: it appeared that  organizational climates of trust, cooperation, and  shared codes and language were associated with  higher levels of knowledge exchange/combination  among knowledge workers. Further, commitment  based HR was significantly related to knowledge  exchange and combination, but this relationship  appeared to be partially mediated through organi  zational social climates.  Next, we examined the combined mediating ef  fects of social climates and knowledge exchange  and combination on the relationship between com  mitment-based HR and firm performance (see Table  4). Following Baron and Kenny's (1986) three-step  procedure, we first examined the relationships be  tween the independent and dependent variables.  As shown in models 2 and 6, our measure of com  mitment-based HR practices was significantly re  lated to revenue from new products and services  (? = .41, p < .01) and sales growth (? = .37, p <  .01). In the second of the three steps, we found  significant relationships between the commitment  based HR practices and firm social climates (trust,  cooperation, and shared codes and language) and  knowledge exchange and combination (see above).  Finally, in the third step of the procedure, we  examined changes in the effect of commitment  based HR practices when social climate and knowl  edge exchange and combination variables were  added to the regressions predicting firm perfor  Results of Regression Analyses Predicting Social Climate3  TABLE 2  Variables  Trust,  Model 1  Trust,  Model 2  Cooperation,  Model 3  Cooperation,  Model 4  Shared Codes  and Language,  Model 5  Shared Codes  and Language,  Model 6  Number of employees13  Number of locations  Industry 1  Industry 2  Industry 3  Industry 4  Industry 5  Commitment-based HR system  R2  Afl2  AF  .07  -.17*  .09  -.06  -.09  .04  .03  .04  .04  1.34  .02  -.16*  .15  -.12  -.13  .01  -.02  .47*  .25  .20  31.22*  .16*  -.12  .09  -.09  -.11  .06  .09  .04  .04  1.44  .10  -.11  .11  -.13  -.15  -.02  .09  .48*  .28  .26  34.43*  .14  -.08  .05  -.14  .06  -.08  -.06  .02  .02  1.01  .09  -.08  .12  -.13  .11  -.03  -.02  .43**  .21  .19  28.64**  a Standardized coefficients are shown.  b Logarithm.  * p < .05  ** p < .01 This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:27:28 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2006  Collins and Smith  TABLE 3  553  Results of Regression Analyses Predicting Knowledge Exchange and Combination3  Variables  Model 1  Model 2  Model 3  Number of employees13  Number of locations  Industry 1  Industry 2  Industry 3  Industry 4  Industry 5  Commitment-based HR practices  Climate for trust  Climate for cooperation  Shared codes and language  R2  AR2  AF  a Standardized coefficients are shown.  b Logarithm.  * p < .05  **p < .01  -.10  -.03  .03  -.02  -.10  .02  .03  .01  .01  0.34  -.11  -.03  .12  -.09  -.11  .02  -.06  .48*  .24  .23  25.21**  -.13  .11  .05  -.13  -.14  -.10  -.12  .20*  .28**  .32**  .21**  .35  .11  8.02**  TABLE 4  Results of Regression Analyses Predicting Firm Performance3  Revenue from New Products and Services  One-Year Sales Growth  Variables  Model 1  Model 2  Model 3  Model 4  Model 5  Model 6  Model 7  Model 8  Number of employees  Number of locations  Industry 1  Industry 2  Industry 3  Industry 4  Industry 5  Commitment-based system  Climate for trust  Climate for cooperation  Shared codes and  .05  -.07  .11  .05  .03  -.04  .05  .03  -.05  .08  .03  .09  .04  -.01  .41*  language  Knowledge exchange/  combination  -.07  -.06  .09  -.05  -.04  -.03  -.07  .19*  .18*  .24**  .21**  .11  .02  .10  .02  .03  .01  .03  .10  .09  .13  .12  .46*  .09  -.05  .03  .05  -.02  -.07  .04  .06  -.04  .09  .03  .07  .04  -.01  .37**  -.07  .10  .07  -.05  -.06  -.03  -.07  .15  .29*  .18*  .23*  .06  .02  .09  .00  .03  .01  .04  .06  .19*  .03  .12  .43*  R2  AR2  F  .01  .01  0.92  .14  .13  16.12*  .21  .07  4.92**  .29  .08  8.27**  .01  .01  0.83  .13  .11  12.56**  .19  .06  3.74*  .24  .05  4.77**  a Standardized coefficients are shown.  b Logarithm.  * p < .05  **p < .01  manee. Our results showed that the relationship  between commitment-based HR practices and rev  enue from new products and services was lower  but still significant when the three climate vari  ables were added to the regression equation (see  model 3) and was no longer significant when  knowledge exchange/combination was added (see  model 4). From the change in the beta coefficient  representing the effect of commitment-based HR  practices on revenue from new products and ser This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:27:28 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  554 Academy of Management Journal June  vices, it appears that approximately 54 percent of  this relationship was explained by the social cli  mate mediators, and an additional 22 percent was  explained by the addition of knowledge exchange/  combination. As shown in models 7 and 8, the  effect of commitment-based HR on sales growth  dropped to nonsignificance when social climate  was added to the regression and dropped further  when knowledge exchange/combination was  added. The change in the beta representing the  effect of commitment-based HR practices on sales  growth indicates that approximately 59 percent of  this relationship was explained by the social cli  mate mediators, and an additional 22 percent was  explained by knowledge exchange/combination.  Thus, although there are some residual direct ef  fects, a large proportion of the relationship between  commitment-based HR practices and firm perfor  mance in our sample seems to be explained by the  mediating effects of social climates and knowledge  exchange and combination.  The results presented in Table 4 also support our  argument that knowledge exchange and combina  tion at least partially mediate the effects of social  climates on firm performance. As shown in model  3 of Table 4, climates for trust (? = .18, p < .05),  cooperation (? = .24, p < .01), and shared codes  and language (? = .21, p < .01) were all signifi  cantly related to revenue from new products and  services. Next, the effects of all three social climate  variables dropped to nonsignificance when knowl  edge exchange and combination were added to the  regression predicting revenue from new products  and services (see model 4). When examining one  year sales growth (see model 7), we again found  that effects of all three climate variables were sig  nificant (trust, ? = .29, p < .01; cooperation, ? =  .18, p < .05; shared codes and language, ? = .23,  p < .01). Again, cooperation and shared codes and  language were no longer significantly related to  sales growth when knowledge exchange/combina  tion was added to the equation (see model 8). The  relationship between trust and one-year sales  growth was reduced but still significant at the .05  level. Overall, knowledge exchange and combina  tion explained between 36 and 83 percent of the  relationships between social climate conditions  and firm performance. Thus, our results suggest  that knowledge exchange/combination at least par  tially mediates the effects of cooperation and  shared codes and language on firm performance.  DISCUSSION  The purpose of this research was to elaborate and  test a more detailed model of how commitment  based HR practices affect knowledge creation and  firm performance through organizational social cli  mate. We developed this model by first defining  commitment-based HR practices in terms of selec  tion, training and development, and pay incen  tives. We then conceptually and empirically con  nected these practices to the organizational social  climate conditions that drive knowledge exchange  and combination among knowledge workers. Im  portantly, we also formulated and tested theory  from the knowledge creation literature that con  nects social climate conditions to firm performance  through their effect on knowledge exchange and  combination. Finally, we extended the literature on  SHRM to a new context and new set of employees  by examining the effects of commitment-based HR  practices on a sample of knowledge workers from  high-technology firms.  Importantly, the effects we discovered are also  meaningful from a practical and financial stand  point. In particular, our results showed that a one  standard-deviation increase in commitment-based  HR practices yields a 16.9 percent increase in sales  from new products and services and an 18.8 per  cent growth in sales. Further, although it is neces  sary to consider mediating links in order to under  stand the impact of HR practices on firm  performance (Becker & Gerhart, 1996), prior studies  have rarely specified or tested specific HR practices  and underlying organizational capabilities to estab  lish these links (Wright et al., 2001). Our study  represents an initial step in this direction. Specifi  cally, we found that commitment-based HR prac  tices were indirectly related to firm performance  through their effects on organizational social cli  mate and knowledge exchange and combination.  Thus, our findings support the argument that re  searchers must explore mediating firm capabilities  to fully understand the role of HR practices on firm  performance. In addition, it may be desirable for  future research to focus on firms facing similar  environments rather than on firms with diverse  environments, because within- rather than cross  industry studies will better allow researchers to  identify the firm capabilities necessary for success.  We were surprised that our mediators explained  such a large proportion of the effects of commit  ment-based HR practices and firm performance. As  noted above, the addition of the social climate vari  ables and of knowledge exchange/combination ex  plained approximately 76 percent of the relation  ship between commitment-based HR and revenue  from new products and services and 84 percent of  the relationship between commitment-based HR  practices and sales growth, leaving few remaining  effects of commitment-based HR to be explained by This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:27:28 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2006 Collins and Smith 555  the other potential mediators suggested in the lit  erature. For example, researchers have speculated  that commitment-based practices also affect firm  performance through their effects on human capital  and skills development (Arthur, 1992; MacDuffie,  1995). It is possible that the social conditions gov  erning employee motivations to interact and  share knowledge may have a stronger effect on  innovation-oriented measures of performance  than does the accumulation of individual human  capital across knowledge workers. For example,  all high-technology firms, independent of their  philosophy regarding how to manage the employ  er-employee relationship, may seek to attract em  ployees who are high in human capital; however,  companies may optimally gain from that higher  level of human capital only by motivating em  ployees to use that knowledge for the benefit of  the firms through HR approaches that create re  lational employer-employee exchanges.  Perhaps most importantly, our findings provide  initial evidence that commitment-based HR prac  tices enable firms to create social environments  that are conducive to knowledge exchange and  combination. Specifically, firms that employ com  mitment-based HR practices are associated with  organizational climates containing higher levels of  trust, cooperation, and shared codes and language  among knowledge workers. Further, the practices  that we included are a general representation of  commitment-based HR practices, not an exhaustive  set. Future research should examine a broader set  of commitment HR practices and also examine the  extent to which such practices need to be internally  consistent and reinforcing to maintain a social cli  mate for knowledge exchange and combination.  It is important to note that, although it was  greatly reduced, the relationship between commit  ment-based HR practices and knowledge exchange  and combination was still significant after the so  cial climate variables were entered into the regres  sion equation. These HR practices may have direct  effects on knowledge exchange and combination,  but it is more likely that they affect other aspects of  firms that influence the exchange and combination  process and were unmeasured in this study. For  example, research on knowledge and the knowl  edge-based view of the firm suggests that factors  such as the structural networks between employees  (Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998; Reagans & McEvily,  2003) and the overall level of human capital in a  firm (Smith et al., 2005) may also affect knowledge  exchange and combination. Therefore, researchers  should begin to explore the effects of commitment  based HR practices on these other drivers of knowl  edge exchange and combination so as to obtain a  complete explanation of how commitment-based  HR practices influence performance.  Our research also supported the argument that  organizational social climates are important for  performance in high-technology firms through  their effects on knowledge exchange and combina  tion. In particular, our results indicated that cli  mates of trust, cooperation, and shared codes and  language were all significantly related to revenue  from new products and services and sales growth,  and these relationships were mediated by the level  of knowledge exchange and combination among  knowledge workers. This finding supports the pub  lic goods argument surrounding social capital in  the literature (Coleman, 1990) and suggests that the  performance of high-technology firms benefits  when they can create social climate conditions of  trust, cooperation, and shared codes and language.  We were somewhat surprised, however, that the  relationships between the social climate variables  were only partially mediated through employee  knowledge exchange and combination. It is likely  that climates of trust, cooperation, and shared  codes and language are strategic variables yielding  other firm-level performance benefits beyond  knowledge creation. For example, social climates  that facilitate high levels of trust, cooperation, and  shared language may allow employees to put forth  greater effort, increase the efficiency of interactions  between employees, and facilitate greater risk tak  ing and experimentation.  As with most research, our results have several  limitations. First, unmeasured exogenous variables  may affect the relationships we studied. For exam  ple, other organizing principles (e.g., organization  al structure, leadership) that we did not study may  affect firms' social climates; therefore, in future  research measures of commitment-based HR prac  tices and other important organizational factors  should be simultaneously collected as a means to  determine the extent to which HR practices affect  the social conditions of firms over and above these  other factors. We also did not control for other  potential mediators that may explain the relation  ship between HR practices and firm performance.  Future research should look at other variables, such  as structural networks, human capital, and team  processes, that may also explain the HR-firm per  formance relationship.  Second, we collected data on social conditions  and on knowledge exchange and combination from  a subset of knowledge workers in each firm; thus,  our measures could only estimate social climates  within the larger group of knowledge workers.  However, ICC statistics for our social climate vari  ables did indicate a high degree of agreement This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:27:28 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  556 Academy of Management Journal June  among the respondents in each company, suggest  ing that our results would likely be the same even  with larger samples of employees from each firm.  Still, researchers may wish to explore the extent to  which commitment-based HR practices have simi  lar effects on all the employees to which they are  applied.  Third, we followed a "best-practices approach"  to studying commitment-based HR, testing whether  companies whose approach to HR was based on  high commitment generally were higher on our so  cial climate variables and firm performance than  were companies whose approach was based on low  commitment. Even though our findings suggested  that companies following a commitment-based ap  proach generally outperformed those not following  a commitment-based approach, we did not exam  ine whether moderating conditions limited the pos  itive impact of commitment-based HR practices.  Future research should look at potential modera  tors of the relationships between these HR practices  and organizational social climate, knowledge ex  change and combination, and firm performance to  determine what types of high-technology compa  nies are the most likely to benefit from adopting a  commitment-based approach to managing their  knowledge workers. It would also be interesting to  examine the conditions under which HR practices  that are not commitment based have positive ef  fects on performance. Further, we were unable to  determine if the companies that scored low on  commitment-based HR practices were following an  alternative approach to managing the employer  employee relationship for key knowledge workers.  It is possible that alternative HR strategies that are  equally successful for managing key knowledge  workers exist (Cappelli, 1999). For example, in  their study of high-tech start-ups, Baron, Hannan,  and Burton (1999) found evidence that CEOs fol  lowed one of five models in their approach to struc  turing the HR practices that shaped the employer  employee relationship. Sherer and Lee (2002), in  their study of law firms, found several very differ  ent ways to structure employment relationships for  lawyers. Therefore, future research should look to  determine if companies implement alternative sys  tems of HR practices to manage key knowledge  workers and if those alternative systems are as ef  fective as a commitment-based approach for man  aging core knowledge workers.  Finally, we collected data regarding commit  ment-based HR practices from a single source?the  top HR manager at each company in our sample.  Despite our demonstration of construct validity for  our commitment-based HR practices measure, cau  tious interpretion is still in order, as researchers  have identified a number of measurement problems  inherent in single-source HR measures (Gerhart,  Wright, McMahan, & Snell, 2000). However, sev  eral of these concerns may not be problematic in  our study. For example, Gerhart et al. (2000) noted  that high correlations between single-source mea  sures of HR practices and outcome measures might  result from systematic error in the form of common  method bias. Systematic error of this kind did not  seem to be an issue in our study as we collected  measures of HR practices, social conditions, and  firm performance from separate sources. Further,  Gerhart et al. raised concerns regarding attenuation  as the result of random error in measurement asso  ciated with single-source measures of HR. Again,  this potential problem did not seem to be a large  concern in our study, given the size of the correla  tions between our HR measure and the mediator  variables. Still, as Gerhart and his colleagues sug  gested, future research should collect measures of  HR practices from multiple respondents to reduce  the problems associated with this type of measure  ment error.  Despite these limitations, our study has a number  of strengths. First, by limiting our focus to high  tech firms, we studied the effects of commitment  based HR practices on firm social climate condi  tions in a sample in which knowledge exchange  and combination was extremely important for firm  survival. If knowledge creation is an important ca  pability for all firms, as Grant (1996) and Smith and  colleagues (2005) suggested, then examining this  process in high-tech firms should also yield in  sights for firms that are not in high-tech industries.  Further, given the variance of our sample on indus  try and organizational size, our results should gen  eralize to other knowledge-intensive firms facing  similar environmental turbulence. An additional  strength was our research design: we obtained data  from independent sources for each firm, including  secondary financial information, surveys of core  knowledge workers, and surveys of HR executives.  Because our independent, mediating, and depen  dent measures were collected from different  sources, we avoided the percept-percept bias asso  ciated with single sources.  Our findings are further strengthened by the use  of lagged data on firm performance. This practice  enabled us to specify with some confidence that  commitment-based HR practices, organizational so  cial climate, and knowledge exchange and combi  nation led to higher revenue from new products  and services and improved sales growth in high  tech firms. Finally, this research provides one of  the first full tests of a mediated relationship be  tween commitment-based HR practices and firm This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:27:28 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2006 Collins and Smith 557  performance. Most researchers have not tested the  proposed mediators of this relationship because  data on organizational capabilities are difficult to  obtain (Becker & Gerhart, 1996; Wright et al., 2001).  By establishing these important links, our study  offers guidance for future conceptual and empirical  work on this important topic.  In conclusion, our study provides preliminary  evidence on the role of firms' commitment-based  HR practices in facilitating social climates of trust,  cooperation, and shared language that lead to  knowledge creation and resultant firm perfor  mance. In particular, we found that our measure of  commitment-based HR practices was significantly  related to the social climates of trust, cooperation,  and shared codes and language that facilitate ex  change and combination among knowledge work  ers. Moreover, these relational social climates of a  firm mediated the relationship between commit  ment-based HR practices, knowledge exchange and  combination, and two measures of firm perfor  mance. Our findings suggest that the leaders of  high-technology firms should carefully choose the  HR practices used to manage their knowledge  workers, because these practices may shape the  firms' social contexts, which, in turn, affect the  firms' ability to create the new knowledge neces  sary for high performance and growth. As such, we  are hopeful that the theory and findings presented  in this paper can lead to more research on how  firms can create knowledge-related advantages, es  pecially in dynamic environments.
