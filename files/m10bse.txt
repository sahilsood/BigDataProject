Emil Morhardt* Roberts Environmental Center, Claremont McKenna College, Claremont, CA, USA ABSTRACT All material related to environmental and social performance on the corporate internet sites  of  454  Fortune  Global  500  and  Fortune  1000  companies  in  25  industrial  sectors  was  analyzed using the Paciﬁ c Sustainability Index. Maximum scores for individual sectors were  20–75 percent of the total possible, highest in the largest and most environmentally sensi- tive sectors and ranging generally linearly, as shown by plotting score versus rank, down  to  nearly  zero  in  every  sector.  None  of  the  variation  in  score  is  explained  by  corporate  revenue in the Asian and European ﬁ rms in this sample (revenues greater than about $9  billion), but there is a very weak correlation between score and revenue for American ﬁ rms  of this size, and a stronger one when Fortune 1000 companies (all American) with revenues  smaller  than  this  are  included,  suggesting  that,  as  corporate  size  reaches  a  certain  threshold,  sustainability  reporting  becomes  independent  of  it.

These reports characteristically  document corporate environmental and social policy, objectives, initiatives and performance, and are increasingly  accompanied  by  third-party  assurance  statements  (Kolk  and  Perego,  2008).  Often  they  are  supplemented  with  additional material on the corporate website and elsewhere, and the delivery of the formal report via the internet  allows this supplemental material to be reached directly from the report by hyperlink. Even when a formal report  following  GRI  or  other  guidelines  is  not  produced,  many  corporate  websites  include  a  considerable  amount  of  *  Correspondence to: J.

Morhardt material suitable for such a report in hyperlinked webpages, and much of the analysis of corporate sustainability  material (Albino et al., 2009; Bonsón-Ponte et al., 2006; Bonsón and Escobar, 2002, 2006; Branco and Rodrigues,  2008; Cerin, 2002; Chapple and Moon, 2005; Jenkins and Yakovleva, 2006; Jose and Lee, 2007; Jung et al., 2001;  Kolk et al., 2008; Lober et al., 1997; Marston and Polei, 2004; Martin and Hadley, 2008; Moore, 2001; Moore and  Robson, 2002; Noci, 2000; O’Dwyer, 2003; Rice, 1993; Roberts Environmental Center, 1999–2009; Rodríguez  Bolívar, 2009; Rodríguez Bolívar and Senés García, 2004; Stiller and Daub, 2007; Vormedal and Ruud, 2009)  has depended on these internet-based materials, although Cerin (2002) noted that it was not always clear that all  appropriate  material  from  a  website  had  been  found  or  that  it  was  up  to  date.  A  few  authors  obtained  printed  reports as their primary source, but also searched for internet-based information as a matter of course (Branco  and Rodrigues, 2008; Kolk et al., 2001; Sinclair and Walton, 2003) or if the printed reports cited material on the  internet (Daub, 2005; Stiller and Daub, 2007). However, one recent study formally eschewed internet-based mate- rial entirely, preferring the stability and accessibility of paper-based reports (Vormedal and Ruud, 2009), and many  studies of corporate social and environmental philosophy, behavior or performance – as opposed to reporting –  have  based  their  analyses  on  survey  forms  sent  to  the  companies  (Banerjee,  2002;  Buil-Carrasco  et  al.,  2008;  Collins et al., 2007; Collison et al., 2009; Fraj-Andres et al., 2008; Martin and Hadley, 2008; Paulraj, 2008; Rao  et al., 2009; Revell and Blackburn, 2007; Studer et al., 2006; Welford, 2004, 2005; Xie and Hayase, 2007). It was  clear as early as 1983 that the cost of disclosing corporate information via print made it difﬁ cult to interpret unam- biguously the absence of such information (Verrecchia, 1983). The low cost of internet-based reporting tends to  solve this problem as long as there is a will to report (Adams and Frost, 2006), and the many specialized features  that  can  be  implemented  (Isenmann,  2004;  Isenmann  et  al.,  2007;  Isenmann  and  Lenz,  2000,  2001,  2002;  Morhardt,  2008)  make  the  internet  even  more  attractive  as  a  means  of  disseminating  corporate  information.  However, although some authors prefer a formal, edited report in electronic format to a set of hyperlinked web  pages (Morhardt and Adidjaja, 2004), it is clear that, if one’s intent is to examine all relevant data, an internet  search should not conﬁ ne itself solely to the formal sustainability reports (Daub, 2005), and, even before the pres- ence  of  sustainability  reporting  in  any  form,  considerable  social  responsibility  information  could  be  found  in  corporate documents other than formal annual reports (Zéghal and Ahmed, 1990). Table  1  is  a  list  of  publications  analyzing  corporate  sustainability  reporting  intended  to  give  an  overview  of  the types of analysis that have been used. It identiﬁ es the source of the information, the numbers of topics and  categories considered, whether the analysis summed the data into an index of the quality of reporting, whether or  not the index was associated with individual companies allowing their ranking and whether or not possible cor- relations between the index value and characteristics of the ﬁ rm (e.g. size, proﬁ tability, sector etc.) were explored.  The main purpose of most of these studies is simply documentation of the types and quantity of sustainability  reporting done by various subsets of companies at the time of the study. There are two general approaches: (1) to  measure the volume of disclosure in sentences, words, numbers of pages or types of report and (2) to document  the presence of predetermined topics. Unerman (2000) provides a more complete documentation of studies of  the  former  type  than  is  included  in  Table  1.  In  the  context  of  evaluating  the  CSR  content  in  Shell’s  corporate  documents over a 100-year period, he argues forcefully that measuring the numbers of pages of output is more  informative  than  ticking  off  topics  on  a  checklist.  Many  of  the  studies  of  the  latter  type  represented  in  Table  1  amount to just ticking off topics and displaying them as a matrix of topics in individual reports (e.g. Holcomb  et al., 2007; Hussey et al., 2001) or as percentages of companies addressing each topic (e.g. Jose and Lee, 2007;  Rikhardsson et al., 2002), but a more sophisticated multi-level analysis is also common, documenting complexity  of disclosure and its quantitative content. The number of levels utilized by each study of this type is also addressed  in Table 1. A logical extension of a multi-level analysis by topic is to combine the results from all topics into an  index of reporting quality. Those studies in Table 1 that have created such an index, or that include data that could  be thus combined, are marked with one asterisk, and if the company-speciﬁ c index values are reported two aster- isks. Of the 15 of the latter, only six (Moore, 2001; Morhardt, 2001; Morhardt et al., 2002; Peck and Sinding, 2003;  Roberts Environmental Center, 1999–2009; SustainAbility, 1993–2008) formally rank the companies for quality  of reporting. Five of the studies creating indices regress them on size and other ﬁ rm characteristics (Brammer  and Pavelin, 2004; Branco and Rodrigues, 2008;Cormier and Magnan, 2003; Moore, 2001; Roberts Environmen- tal Center, 1999–2009) or on external environmental performance measures (Wiseman, 1982), with the intent of  identifying reasons for good reporting.

Morhardt As  described  above,  the  quality  of  sustainability  reporting  is  often  analyzed  by  documenting  the  presence  of  a  predetermined set of topics as documented in Table 1. Kolk and Mauser (2002), building on the work of Doty and  Glick (1994), examined a large number of publications, six of them appearing in Business Strategy and the Environ- ment (Callens and Wolters, 1998; Ghobadian et al., 1998; Lee and Green, 1994; Roome, 1992; Shrivastava and  Hart, 1995; Stikker, 1992), describing approaches to environmental management, and classiﬁ ed them into primar- ily two types, which are also appropriate for classiﬁ cation of sustainability reporting: continuum and typology. The  continuum type results in the linear classiﬁ cation of individual companies (or their reporting) into one of a series  of classes, each more comprehensive than the previous one. The classes can be descriptive, such as the designa- tions of ‘beginner’, ‘ﬁ re ﬁ ghter’, ‘concerned citizen’, ‘pragmatist’ and ‘proactivist’ by Hunt and Auster (1990), but  when these were applied, for example, to environmental reporting of Norwegian and food processing industries  by Hass (1996) they did not seem to accurately characterize the status of the companies. The typology approach  often envisions a matrix structure in which a combination of criteria is possible (Kolk and Mauser, 2002), and  such a combination can also result in a numerical outcome arrived at by assigning values to each of the criteria  and aggregating them, a position that Hass (1996) defaulted to, arraying the aggregate scores onto a linear con- tinuum in the approach used in this paper. The reports marked in Table 1 with two asterisks use at least part of  this approach, and are described in more detail below. Wiseman (1982), analyzing annual reports, examined 18 environmental topics at four levels of reporting in ﬁ ve  categories,  and  summed  them  into  an  unweighted  index,  plus  number  of  sentences  on  each  topic  (line  count  index). Both indices were reported by company, but, although the scores were not associated with company names,  the overall environmental disclosure index and its ﬁ ve categories were regressed on external environmental per- formance measures, deﬁ ned by the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP). There was no correlation between the  indices and the CEP rankings. SustainAbility (1993–2008) published an inﬂ uential series of benchmarking studies  based on corporate environmental reports, later supplemented with information on corporate websites, ranking  the companies for quality of reporting. Azzone and Manzini (1994) examined company reports of 15 large multi- nationals, documenting whether they had any disclosure of ﬁ ve different categories of environmental performance  indicators (prevention costs and investments, operating environmental costs, contingent environmental liabilities,  physical indicators and compliance) and reported them by company in a matrix that could be summed to create  a reporting index, allowing the ranking of the ﬁ rms. Davis-Walling and Batterman (1997) examined the 24 envi- ronmental  reports  produced  by  Fortune  50  companies  at  the  time  for  one  or  two  levels  of  information  on  29  environmental  reporting  topics  and  presented  the  raw  data  in  a  table  that  allows  ranking  the  companies.  Sub- sequently,  the  Roberts  Environmental  Center  at  Claremont  McKenna  College  (1999–2009)  began  an  ongoing  characterization of corporate sustainability reporting on company websites based on the Paciﬁ c Sustainability Index  (PSI) (Morhardt, 2002; Roberts Environmental Center, 2008), effectively amalgamating the ideas in the ISO 14031  and GRI guidelines into a comprehensive sustainability reporting scorecard customized for each industrial sector  and  reported  as  a  single  score  (with  several  subsets  available)  for  each  company.  Morhardt  (2001)  applied  the  Davis-Walling and Batterman, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (1999) and SustainAbility scoring systems to data avail- able in 1998 on the websites of the companies scored in two previous reports (Davis-Walling and Batterman, 1997;  SustainAbility–UNEP, 1996) and found that the scores of all three were similar in magnitude and strongly cor- related.  Morhardt  et  al.  (2002)  carried  this  analysis  farther  for  the  10  largest  companies  in  four  sectors  (motor  vehicles and parts, petroleum reﬁ ning, utilities and electronics) using these three scoring systems plus two addi- tional ones of their own design based on the ISO 14031 (ISO, 1999) and GRI 2000 (GRI, 2000) guidelines. The  latter two included many topics not considered in the published scoring systems, and the scores from them were  much lower, suggesting plenty of room for more complete reporting and more detailed analysis. Jung et al. (2001),  like Morhardt et al. (2002), considered that GRI and ISO 14031 were good candidate lists of environmental indica- tors, and selected a subset of 29 them to create the ‘GScore’ index, which they then used to score 39 EHS reports  from ﬁ rms in the petroleum and reﬁ ning industry that had put their reports on the internet. Hussey et al. (2001)  also saw the merit of using the GRI reporting guidelines as an index of reporting and used all 114 of the topics to  score the 1995–2000 sustainability reports of 10 large ﬁ rms, presenting the adherence to each of the topics by  company in a matrix, creating an incipient index. Moore (2001) created an independent index of social performance  Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment    Bus. Strat. Env. (2009) DOI: 10.1002/bse Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting on the Internet by aggregating the unweighted scores of 16 social performance criteria, then used it to rank eight ﬁ rms in the UK  supermarket industry. In an unusual approach, Peck and Sinding (2003) created two indices for individual large  mining companies, one related to expressed environmental intent and the other to presentation of quantitative  data, then plotted the two indices against each other, resulting in an unquantiﬁ ed regression suggesting a strong  link between the two. Daub (2005) developed an index assigning a numerical rating to each of 33 topics, then used  it to rank the sustainability reports of 73 Swiss companies, and Jenkins and Yakovleva (2006) studied the report- ing  of  the  largest  mining  companies  and  presented  the  data  as  a  matrix  of  general  environmental  categories  reported on by company, effectively creating an index that they could have compared to those of Peck and Sinding  (2003). Finally, Holcomb et al. (2007) looked at the reporting of the top 10 hotel companies in the world, associat- ing the presence of 16 (unidentiﬁ ed) sustainability topics with the individual company reports, but did not formally  rank the companies. A principal research question of all of these studies was descriptive: to describe the current  state of reporting. This paper reﬂ ects a much larger effort along these same lines, using the PSI. The results presented here com- prise an overview of sector-by-sector sustainability reporting of many of the world’s largest companies characterized  by the overall PSI score. Although there are now many studies evaluating the environmental reporting, and less often the social report- ing, of corporations by sector, this is the ﬁ rst that systematically looks at all Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000  companies in each sector analyzed, calculates a single performance index and ranks them. The result is a system- atic analysis spanning a corporate size (revenue) range of over two orders of magnitude (from $1.4 billion to $380  billion), much larger than covered in most other studies, so the effect of company size – or lack of it – on sustain- ability reporting should be clearly discernable. The size of company considered here is well above what is usually  considered small or medium sized (European Commission, 2005), however, so reporting considerations speciﬁ - cally  related  to  such  ﬁ rms  (cf.  Borga  et  al.,  2009)  are  not  addressed  here.  Plotting  the  scores  of  each  company  within each sector by rank from highest to lowest reveals not only the overall differences in score among sectors,  but also sector-wide patterns of reporting, making it possible to determine whether in some sectors most – or,  alternatively, very few – companies do a good job of reporting or whether there is a gradual falling off of scores  from the best to the poorest reporters. This paper contributes to the literature by demonstrating striking differences in sustainability reporting across  industrial sectors and across companies in each sector. It uses the technique of encapsulating such reporting in  a  single  score  for  each  company  and  plotting  the  scores  by  rank,  a  technique  not  previously  used  in  analyzing  sustainability reporting, providing an unusually graphic overview of differences across sectors, and of how scores  in each sector relate to one another. In particular, it shows that in only a few sectors are the leading reporters far  above their peers; in most sectors there is a fairly linear decline in PSI score from the best reporters in a sector to  the worst, which in all sectors report hardly anything. Furthermore, the best reporters in the best reporting sectors  have more than three times the overall PSI score than the best reporters in the poorest sectors. This paper also  demonstrates that, although corporate size is clearly important in sustainability reporting if a large enough size  range  is  considered,  it  appears  to  be  unimportant  when  all  sectors  are  considered  together  in  companies  large  enough to be included in the Fortune Global 500. Other Approaches to Characterizing Sustainability Reporting In addition to the analysis schemes that, like the one used in this paper, set out to score and rank individual com- panies, many studies have analyzed various aspects of the environmental and social content of corporate reporting  across a range of companies, most reporting the data in aggregate. Some have conﬁ ned their analysis to companies  that  produced  free-standing  environmental  or  related  reports  (see  Table  1  for  this  and  the  other  characteristics  mentioned here.) Sometimes they also include material in annual reports, but most have analyzed material whether  in a formal report or not, with increasing dependence on materials provided on the internet. Some have examined  companies in a single industry, from a single country or a few countries, or both, but some, like this study, have  had as their target group the largest companies, irrespective of country or industrial afﬁ liation. Daub (2007) took issue with national and international studies on the quality of corporate sustainability report- ing that select individual reports that appear to be extremely good and analyze only them. He particularly notes  Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment    Bus. Strat. Env. (2009) DOI: 10.1002/bse   J. E. Morhardt this practice in the benchmark studies of the consultancy SustainAbility, begun in 1994, the most recent of which  (SustainAbility, 2006) continues this approach. It was this exclusion of lesser reporters that prompted me to begin  analyzing all companies above a certain size within an externally determined industrial sector. Doing so has the  obvious advantage of allowing an unbiased comparison of reporting across sectors. Daub also objected to exclusion  of information not contained in a formally designated sustainability report, an obvious issue when attempting to  compare  all  companies  of  a  certain  size  within  a  sector,  because  many,  even  those  publishing  much  relevant  information, package it in other ways: hence my strategy of including all relevant material available on corporate  websites  at  the  time  of  analysis.  Daub  himself,  however,  in  setting  out  to  analyze  the  top  100  companies  in  Switzerland,  could  not  resist  including  two  smaller  companies  because  of  the  quality  of  their  reporting  (Daub,  2007), and selected enough companies ranked between 100 and 200 to obtain at least ﬁ ve companies from each  sector, much as I have done here, augmenting Fortune Global 500 companies with smaller Fortune 1000 com- panies to obtain 30 companies per sector when possible. Methods and Results The subject of this paper is the material related to environmental and social issues posted on the websites of cor- porations on the Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 lists. The lists group the companies into industrial sectors,  and this paper analyzes the reporting of companies in 25 of these sectors (identiﬁ ed in Figures 1 and 2) using the  Figure 1.  Ranking of PSI overall scores for companies in 25 industrial sectors. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment    Bus. Strat. Env. (2009) DOI: 10.1002/bse Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting on the Internet Figure 2.  Ranking of revenue for companies in 25 industrial sectors. most recent data available in May 2008 from the Roberts Environmental Center sustainability reporting database  (Roberts Environmental Center, 1999–2009). For sectors with more than 30 companies, only the largest 30 were  analyzed. For the remainder, all companies in the sector were included. The companies on the Fortune 1000 list  (an extension of the Fortune 500 list) are all based in the US, so all companies smaller in size than those on the  Fortune 500 list (revenues of about $9 billion depending on year) are American. All relevant materials from the websites of each company were downloaded and scored using the PSI, which  consists of a base scoring sheet used for all sectors and a sector-speciﬁ c scoring sheet with more specialized topics.  The detailed scoring sheets are available at the Roberts Environmental Center (2008) website. In addition to the  PSI overall score, which is calculated as the percentage of the total possible score on the PSI scoring sheets, scores  for six subsets of the overall score were calculated, each also expressed as a percentage of its total possible score.  These scores are based on mutually exclusive subsets of all of the PSI topics, grouped into the categories of envi- ronmental and social intent (expressions of intending to act in a sustainable manner), environmental and social  reporting (the extent to which numerical data, good or bad, are reported) and environmental and social performance  (numerical data showing improvement and better than sector average values). The PSI overall scores for each sector plotted by rank (Figure 1) show that the highest scores for each sector  vary widely, between 20 and over 70 percent of the highest possible score, with a large gap between those scoring  above 40 percent and the four sectors near 20 percent. These latter sectors – oil equipment, scientiﬁ c and photo  equipment, wholesalers and homebuilders – have relatively few (between 10 and 15) members, most of them not  in  the  Fortune  Global  500,  and  are  not  obviously  associated  with  environmental  or  social  issues,  thus  it  is  not  Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment    Bus. Strat. Env. (2009) DOI: 10.1002/bse   J. E. Morhardt surprising that they are not yet reporting much sustainability information. Nevertheless, the highest scorers in  each are Fortune Global 500 companies. Four other sectors – mail, food services, forest and paper products and  medical  products  –  are  equally  small  but  have  at  least  some  companies  with  much  better  reporting  and  hence  higher scores. Most of the sectors with the highest scores also have many more companies on the Fortune lists,  and about half of them score higher than the highest scores of the smallest sectors. Thus, having more companies  in the pool appears to increase the chances of having some that are actively engaged in sustainability reporting.  Some  sectors  strongly  associated  with  environmental  or  social  issues,  such  as  utilities  and  petroleum  reﬁ ning,  retain high scores over much of their range, as do, for less obvious reasons, but probably having to do with strong  retail–customer interactions, motor vehicles and parts, and banks. Most sectors also have members with very low  scores,  so  it  is  clear  that  even  in  this  sample  of  fairly  large  companies  the  decision  to  engage  in  sustainability  reporting is by no means universal. The companies within each sector, although large, are not comparable in size, in some sectors varying in annual  revenue by more than two orders of magnitude. Figure 2 displays the revenue by rank of all companies by sector  and superﬁ cially resembles the plots in Figure 1; however, the revenue axis is exponential rather than linear, so,  even though appearing similar to Figure 1, the revenue falls off with rank much faster than the PSI overall scores  fall off with rank. It might be expected that companies with more revenue would do better sustainability reporting  than those with low revenue, and indeed this is true when all companies in the sample are considered. Figure 3  is a regression of the PSI overall scores on the revenue of all companies in the sample (omitting banks, which  report  assets  rather  than  revenue).  Log-transformation  of  revenue  increased  linearity  and  resulted  in  a  highly  signiﬁ cant  regression  (P  <  0.000),  with  log  revenue  explaining  a  third  of  the  variability  in  PSI  overall  scores  (adjusted r2 = 0.33). Regressions of PSI overall score (and all other subsets of PSI scores) on income of Fortune  Global  500  European,  and  Asian  ﬁ rms  are  all  insigniﬁ cant,  however,  indicating  that  the  overall  regression  is  entirely driven by the American ﬁ rms in the sample, which by themselves result in an adjusted r2 of 0.34. The  strength of the overall regression, while still highly signiﬁ cant, falls considerably when only ﬁ rms in the Fortune  Global 500 are included (adjusted r2 = 0.07 for all data, adjusted r2 = 0.15 for American ﬁ rms only), thus the inclu- sion of Fortune 1000 (American) ﬁ rms with revenues less than around $9 billion is a strong contributor to the  Figure 3.

Also clearly visible in Figure 3 is a shift in the distribution of scores at about the threshold size of the  Fortune Global 500. Companies with revenues between $1 billion and $9 billion have almost no scores over 40;  immediately above this revenue level the highest scores are commonly above 50, with some above 60. No Asian  or European ﬁ rms smaller than those in the Fortune Global 500 were included in the dataset, so the effect they  might have had on the distribution of scores or the strength of the overall regression is unknown. The subsets of the PSI scores are all highly signiﬁ cantly correlated with one another (Table 2), indicating that,  in general, if companies begin reporting at all they tend not to conﬁ ne themselves to just environmental or just  social reporting, and if they express intent to report they tend to provide numbers as well. Those ﬁ rms expressing  the strongest intent to report also report the most and have the best performance. That said, however, there is a  considerable  amount  of  scatter  in  these  correlations.

(2009) DOI: 10.1002/bse   J. E. Morhardt analogous to the analysis by Peck and Sinding (2003) of the reporting of the mining sector, shows just how noisy  the data are. Many companies (those in the Starters quadrat) achieve high intent scores but do not follow this up  with much numerical data. Others (the few in the Hoarders quadrat) provide the data without saying much about  it. The slopes of the regression lines ﬁ tted to both environmental and social data (not shown) are considerably less  than 1.0, reﬂ ecting the fact that meeting the intent requirements of the PSI is considerably easier than providing  the data expected by it under the reporting requirements. Discussion The  main  empirical  result  of  this  study  is  that,  for  most  sectors,  there  is  a  smooth  gradation  in  sustainability  reporting from the best reporters to the worst, and in all sectors the worst reporters are very bad indeed. In par- ticular,  it  is  the  lower  end  of  reporting  that  is  seldom  examined.  There  are  only  a  few  studies  (Holcomb  et  al.,  2007; Jenkins and Yakovleva, 2006; Jung et al., 2001) other than those of the Roberts Environmental Center (on  whose data this paper is based) that systematically evaluate the reporting of all the largest companies in each sector,  irrespective of status of sustainability reporting, and score them in a way that can be ranked, although there are  many studies that include all reporters and non-reporters without ranking them (see Table 1). Other examples of  ranking score only the best reporters across sectors (SustainAbility, 1993–2008), only the largest companies across  sectors (Davis-Walling and Batterman, 1997; Morhardt, 2001), only the largest companies within sectors that had  environmental reports on their websites (Morhardt et al., 2002; Peck and Sinding, 2003), or only companies that  submitted reports for scoring (Daub, 2005). Only by scoring all the information on the websites of all the largest  companies in each sector does it become clear that such a large range of reporting exists, and that there are few  substantial discontinuities when the scores are arranged in ranks. The most striking discontinuities occur in the  sectors  with  the  fewest  companies,  particularly  medical  products  (in  which  one  ﬁ rm  had  twice  the  score  of  its  nearest rival, which in turn had three times the score of the next in line) and entertainment (in which the scores  of the two leaders were both more than twice as high as that of the third in line.) In the medical products sector  all the companies are relatively small – less than $10 billion, but the highest scorer is twice as large as the second  highest scorer so this may be a size effect. In the entertainment sector the two scoring leaders are much larger  than the next four highest-scoring ﬁ rms, and more than half again as large as any of the other ﬁ rms in the sector,  so  this  discontinuity  of  scoring  also  appears  to  be  a  size  effect  with  the  largest  companies  in  the  sector  in  the  Fortune Global 500 size range, and the others well below it. There is considerable evidence that corporate social responsibility is at least partially inﬂ uenced by size. It is  easy to imagine that small companies do not see any competitive advantage in making environmental improve- ments (Revell and Blackburn, 2007; Simpson et al., 2004; Studer et al., 2006; Vazquez and Liston-Heyes, 2008),  and that small ﬁ rms with low perceived impact on the environment are likely to ignore it and take a completely  passive stance (Buil-Carrasco et al., 2008), potentially to their detriment as they are cut out of larger companies’  supply chains, even though adoption of CSR practices could confer many tangible beneﬁ ts on them (Welford and  Frost, 2006). In medium and large size ﬁ rms, however, there are likely to be a variety of internal and external  pressures to demonstrate social responsibility, making it easier for managers who want to act accordingly to do  so (Buil-Carrasco et al., 2008), particularly if these executives are responsible for environmental matters (Aragón- Correa et al., 2004). Larger companies often are found to do a better job (cf. Adams et al., 1998; Brammer and  Pavelin,  2004;  Branco  and  Rodrigues,  2008;  Cormier  and  Magnan,  2003;  Patten,  1991)  if  a  large  enough  size  range is considered, and I suspect that if the size range in this study were extended downward the relationship  between size and PSI score would increase. Given the substantial scatter in the relationship between company size and score in this study (Figure 3) and  within each sector (not shown), and the lack of any clear effect of size once it exceeds annual revenues of about  $9 billion, it is clear that there are many considerations other than size contributing to development of good CSR  practices and sustainability reporting in every sector. Some of these possibilities include risk reduction (Bebbing- ton  et  al.,  2007;  Spence,  2009;  Unerman,  2008;  Welford  and  Frost,  2006),  information  cost  (Cormier  and  Magnan, 2003), fear of losing competitive advantage by unnecessary disclosure (Daub, 2005), employee retention  (Welford and Frost, 2006), high visibility to regulators, pressure groups and the media (Brammer and Pavelin,  Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment    Bus. Strat. Env. (2009) DOI: 10.1002/bse Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Reporting on the Internet 2004) and a host of others, but there does not appear to be any single overwhelming driving factor. Even though  size has been shown to be important, there has been a tendency in the literature to look broadly at the sustain- ability reporting of only the largest ﬁ rms (see Table 1). Although the lack of CSR activities in the smallest ﬁ rms is  well  documented  (Revell  and  Blackburn,  2007;  Simpson  et  al.,  2004;  Studer  et  al.,  2006;  Vazquez  and  Liston- Heyes, 2008; Welford and Frost, 2006) – and from this we can infer a lack of reporting, reporting in mid-sized  ﬁ rms has largely been ignored. That there are sector differences in CSR orientation and reporting is also well documented (Banerjee, 2002;  Brammer  and  Pavelin,  2004;  Branco  and  Rodrigues,  2008;  Jose  and  Lee,  2007;  Patten,  1991)  and  a  variety  of  possible drivers are suspected including established environmental sensitivity and substantial direct environmen- tal impacts in sectors such as manufacturing, resources, utilities, chemicals pharmaceuticals, motor vehicles and  parts (Brammer and Pavelin, 2004; Kolk et al., 2001), and close relationships with consumers in sectors such as  banking,  food/drink/tobacco,  media  and  retailing  (Brammer  and  Pavelin,  2008).  The  same  general  arguments  apply in this study, with aerospace, motor vehicles and parts, pharmaceuticals, petroleum reﬁ ning, chemicals and  banks doing the most reporting. Choice of Variables and the PSI The different studies of sustainability reporting based on predetermined topics use a wide range of them (Table  1) from just one (Sinclair and Walton, 2003) to over 300 keywords (Pollach et al., 2009). The PSI is in the middle,  with 60 baseline topics and as many as 20 additional sector-speciﬁ c topics of up to seven levels contributing to  the score (but with all ﬁ nal scores normalized to the maximum possible points for the sector). The sector-speciﬁ c  topics are determined by what the top reporters in each sector are reporting, rather than on a construct of what  should be reported. The intent behind the PSI is to capture as many topics as the leading companies in each sector  are actually reporting, and the 60 baseline topics and up to 20 sector-speciﬁ c topics are required to do so. It would  certainly be possible to create an even more complex scoring system based on speciﬁ c reporting guidelines, as has  previously  been  done  using  the  GRI  2000  guidelines  (Hussey  et  al.,  2001;  Morhardt  et  al.,  2002;  Rikhardsson  et al., 2002; Stiller and Daub, 2007). Indeed, if attempts succeed to persuade companies to use XBRL to tag the  sustainability data they put on the internet (GRI, 2007; Isenmann et al., 2007), it will become trivial to implement  an automated scoring system based on the GRI G3 guidelines. It can be argued, as it has been by Hubbard (2009),  that large sets of topics such as these are impossibly complex and that a much more manageable subset would be  preferable. He would limit environmental reporting to key material use, energy use, water use and sector-speciﬁ c  waste emissions, all normalized to units produced or as percent of total resources used. His choice of social issues  would  include  employee  satisfaction,  social  performance  of  suppliers,  community  relationships,  philanthropic  investments  and  some  form  of  industry-speciﬁ c  factor  such  as  ‘community  open  days’.  The  problem  with  his  approach is that when attempting to characterize what companies are actually reporting, especially when compar- ing a group of companies with highly disparate reporting practices, as is usually the case, there would be very little  comparable information available if only Hubbard’s criteria were used. The question then is whether or not there  is an optimal number of topics that capture overall quality of reporting and performance. On one hand, the fact  that all of the subsets of the PSI in this dataset are strongly correlated suggests that any of them might be adequate  if the desired end result were characterizing, in a general sense, the quality of individual corporate reporting. Such  a correlation is not uncommon, with positive correlations found between environmental management initiatives  and both environmental performance and improvements of environmental performance (Rao et al., 2009), and  between  different  subsets  of  indicators  of  environmental  management  quality  (Xie  and  Hayase,  2007).  On  the  other hand, the best reporters continually add topics to their sustainability reporting, and it seems to me that that  information should be captured and should form the basis of future reporting standards for the sector. Conclusions and Suggestions for Future Research This research is unique in creating indices of sustainability reporting for all companies within selected sectors of  the Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000, irrespective of the amount of reporting they do, then ranking them. It  Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment    Bus. Strat. Env. (2009) DOI: 10.1002/bse   J. E. Morhardt reveals, in a graphic way, the extreme range of reporting in every sector examined – 25 in this sample – of the  largest  global  and  American  companies,  and  the  generally  uniform  distribution  of  reporting  within  almost  all  sectors from very good to very poor. When data from all sectors are combined and only Fortune Global 500 ﬁ rms  are considered, there is a very wide range of reporting quality but little evidence of size inﬂ uencing it; almost all  of the best reporters, as well as many of the worst, are in this group. Below this size, all American companies in  this sample, the scores are notably lower and, in addition, there is a deﬁ nite but small increase in the quality of  reporting with size. In both these and in the entire sample of 454 ﬁ rms, however, the scatter in Figure 3 shows  that there are clearly other, unknown factors at work, which are not well explained in the literature. A signiﬁ cant  gap in this study is the lack of European and Asian ﬁ rms in the $1–10 billion range. It would be extremely inter- esting to see whether their scores reﬂ ect the lesser reporting seen in the smaller American ﬁ rms. It would also be  useful to examine reporting down at least another order of magnitude in company size to $100 million, well above  the usual deﬁ nition of medium-size business, but a size range not much examined for sustainability reporting. If  Fortune Global 500 companies continue to increase the quality of their reporting to the point that there are few  differences  among  them,  smaller  ﬁ rms  are  likely  to  feel  increased  pressure  to  emulate  them  in  reporting,  and  studies such as this one will, of necessity, move to smaller companies.
