Based  on the literature review, we developed a research question: How does communication via  responsibility reporting affect ﬁ rm value? We analyzed the market valuation of listed Finnish  ﬁ rms through a conventional valuation model combined with responsibility reporting. The  starting point for our valuation was the Ohlson model. We expanded upon the conventional  valuation by studying whether communication via responsibility reporting is related to ﬁ rm  valuation.  Our  research  question  is  linked  to  the  broader  academic  question  of  whether  earnings worth as an information source has been erased over the last few years. In addi- tion,  we  contribute  to  the  literature  that  tries  to  understand  the  link  between  corporate  social responsibility and ﬁ rm performance/share performance. Speciﬁ cally, we focused on  responsibility reporting according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and especially on  whether the existence of these reports provides a further explanation for ﬁ rm value. Our sample was a population type that covered all listed Finnish ﬁ rms that have adopted  GRI. No other responsibility reporting practice was used by listed ﬁ rms in their responsibil- ity reporting communication during the years 2002–2005. The other necessary information  for  valuation  models  was  obtained  from  Thomson  Financial  Services  (commercial  database). The applied model supported the conclusion that communication via GRI responsibility  reporting is an important explanatory factor for a ﬁ rm’s market value. The result indicates  that responsibility reporting is a part of a ﬁ rm’s communication tools in order to decrease  information asymmetry between managers and investors. In other words, GRI responsibil- ity reporting is called for in order to produce a more precise market valuation of a ﬁ rm.  Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

FIRMS’  PERFORMANCE  IS  increasingly related, for example, to their intangible assets and R&D. In line with this, a signiﬁ cant portion  of  a  ﬁ rm’s  value  is  based  on  future  expectations  and  less  on  fundamentals.  Shortcomings  in  (investor)  communication  can  cause  a  ﬁ rm  several  difﬁ culties  that  are  often  reﬂ ected  in  its  cost  of  capital  (Healy  and Palepu, 2001). Severe communication problems between ﬁ rms and investors (high information asymmetry)  could even lead to a loss of trust on the part of investors and an increase in the cost of, say, equity capital (Hail,  2002). One  important  dimension  of  ﬁ rm-to-else  communication  is  the  ﬁ rm’s  responsibility  disclosures  (Slater  and  Gilbert,  2004).  Several  studies  have  tried  to  explain  the  reasons  for  a  certain  level  and  quality  of  responsibility  disclosures. Cormier et al. (2005) identify determinants of corporate environmental disclosure employing several  theories that rely on economic incentives, public pressures, and institutional theory. Their major argument was  that the quality of environmental disclosure is driven by the level of management’s accountability to a particular  stakeholder group. First, management is directly accountable to shareholders and debt holders. This should create  an incentive for high-quality disclosures in order to minimize a ﬁ rm’s cost of capital (Cormier et al., 2005). Second,  a ﬁ rm is a part of its societal context and a wide range of other stakeholders affects it, including employees, sup- pliers, customers, and citizens in general. According to legitimacy theory, a ﬁ rm responds to public pressures via  its environmental disclosure. Finally, management considers a ﬁ rm’s institutional context in determining envi- ronmental disclosure quality. That institutional context could be either ﬁ rm- or country-speciﬁ c (Cormier et al.,  2005). The main results indicated that information costs (risk, reliance on capital markets, trading volume, owner- ship) are important determinants of a ﬁ rm’s environmental disclosure strategy. Also, public pressures and industry  membership affect the quality of corporate environmental disclosure. In line with institutional theory, imitation  and routine are related to environmental disclosure quality. Also others have found that variations in demand for responsibility reporting affect the actual corporate social  responsibility (CSR) presentation. For example, Maignan and Ralston (2002) found that French and Dutch busi- nesses were less eager to convey good citizenship images on the web compared to their Anglo counterparts. Overall,  their study shows that a country’s attitude to responsibility reporting had an impact on how dedicated a ﬁ rm is to  social responsibility. Firms will face challenges in their sustainability communication in several areas, such as eco-innovations, envi- ronmental  innovations,  and  product  improvements  (Halila  and  Horte,  2006).  Modern  western  consumers  are  increasingly well informed about the consequences of a ﬁ rm’s activities. Research has shown that the more atten- tion  a  medium  devotes  to  an  issue  in  a  ﬁ rm  context,  the  more  the  issue  will  become  associated  with  the  ﬁ rm  among  the  users  of  that  medium  (Meijer  and  Kleinnijenhuis,  2006).  Due  the  multidimensional  and  complex  nature of sustainable development in a ﬁ rm, there are several ways to measure it. The development of the Global  Reporting Initiative’s (GRI’s) guidelines on sustainability reporting is a signiﬁ cant step in assisting ﬁ rms to achieve  more systematic measurement and communication of sustainability issues to investors and other stakeholders.  GRI was launched in 1997 jointly by the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies and the United  Nations Environmental Program. The goal of the initiative is to develop a global reporting framework for sustain- able reporting (Clarkson et al., 2008). The GRI guidelines follow 11 principles: transparency, inclusiveness, audit- ability, completeness, relevance, sustainability context, accuracy, neutrality, comparability, clarity, and timeliness.  These principles should guide those producing sustainable reports in making the reports useful to stakeholders  (Clarkson et al., 2008). Researchers are attempting to understand the link between CSR and competitive advantage (Porter and Kramer,  2006). Instead of focusing on the determinants of sustainable disclosures, these studies relate disclosures to ﬁ rm  performance and stock performance. Some evidence is available that ﬁ rms with strong environmental manage- ment enjoy a better ﬁ nancial performance (Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996; Clarkson et al., 2006). There is also  evidence that emission reduction is positively associated with ﬁ rm performance (return on sales, return on assets,  and return on equity) within one to two years (Hart and Ahuja, 1996). Contrary results are also reported. King  and Lenox (2001) ﬁ nd evidence of an association between lower pollution and higher ﬁ nancial valuation (Tobin’s  Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment    Corp. Soc. Responsib. Environ. Mgmt. 17, 96–106 (2010) DOI: 10.1002/csr 98  H. Schadewitz and M. Niskala q). However, according to the authors, this association might be due to ﬁ rm’s ﬁ xed characteristics and strategic  position rather than lower pollution. The  investment  community  analyzes  ﬁ rms  from  a  broad  perspective,  including  responsibility  issues  in  their  agenda (Cormier et al., 1993). Examples of responsibility oriented institutional investors can be termed ethical funds.  Simultaneously to these developments, the tools for the broader analysis of ﬁ rms have been created; for example,  responsibility ratings such as the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and FTSE4Good series. Principles for Responsible  Investing (PRI, www.unpri.org/) and the Enhanced Analytics Initiative (EAI, www.enhancedanalytics.com/portal/ ep/home.do) are two important developments designed to enhance responsibility in investing. In early 2005, the  UN Secretary-General invited a group of the world’s largest institutional investors to a forum to develop the PRI.  EAI,  in  turn,  is  an  international  collaboration  between  asset  owners  and  asset  managers  aimed  at  encouraging  better investment research; in particular, research taking into account extra-ﬁ nancial issues, such as externalities  not well captured by market mechanisms (e.g., pollution), the medium- to long-term horizon (e.g., global warming),  and the policy and regulatory framework (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions). Variations in investors’ skills, experience,  and incentives, among others, can affect the use of information disclosed by a ﬁ rm (Kothari, 2001; Shleifer, 2003). The links between responsibility reporting and its effect on ﬁ rm value are still incomplete and the results some- what mixed. Guenster et al. (2005) analyzed whether corporate eco-efﬁ ciency (the ability to create more value while  using fewer environmental resources) had economic value. Their eco-efﬁ ciency measure reﬂ ects not only historical  environmental performance but also identiﬁ es future environmental risks and opportunities. The eco-efﬁ ciency  score reﬂ ects environmental performance in ﬁ ve areas: historical liabilities in consequence of a ﬁ rm’s past envi- ronmental behavior, contemporaneous operating risk, sustainability and eco-efﬁ ciency risk, managerial efﬁ ciency  risk, and business prospects resulting from eco-efﬁ ciency. Obtained results show a positive but asymmetrical rela- tion  between  eco-efﬁ ciency  and  a  ﬁ rm’s  Tobin’s  q  (market  value  of  assets  divided  by  the  book  value  of  assets).  Furthermore,  results  suggest  that  the  market  incorporates  environmental  information  with  a  drift.  Their  data  comprise US-listed ﬁ rms. A study in the Egyptian context gives additional insight. Wahba (2008) found out that  environmental responsibility (proxied by certiﬁ cation of ISO environmental standard) exerted a positive and sig- niﬁ cant coefﬁ cient on the ﬁ rm market value. Another  study,  by  Hassel  et  al.  (2005),  investigates  the  value-relevance  of  environmental  performance  using  Swedish data. They found that environmental performance (measured by an environmental index) had a negative  inﬂ uence on the market value of ﬁ rms. This ﬁ nding supported the cost-concerned school arguing that environ- mental investments represent only increased costs. Our study will focus on more recent Finnish data using ofﬁ - cially available responsibility reports, and will address the important research void between responsibility reporting  and ﬁ rm valuation. Some shortcomings exist in responsibility research – besides the limited amount of research concerning a link  between responsibility reporting and ﬁ rm value – despite recent increased activity. The nature of prior responsibil- ity research is that it is rather isolated; special purpose analyses that lack any strong attempt (or even the possibility)  to generalize the results (Grifﬁ n and Mahon, 1997). In addition, there were no links available to the ﬁ rms’ periodi- cal reporting. There has also been a call for a better deﬁ ned external environmental monitoring system enabling  external screening of environmental issues in a ﬁ rm (Ulhoi et al., 1996). In line with these prior calls for additional  research, we analyze ﬁ rm value and tightly link it to the periodical reporting information. In Finland, all listed ﬁ rms that publish responsibility reports apply GRI guidelines on sustainability reporting  (information received from 2future, Finland’s leading consulting ﬁ rm in the ﬁ eld of corporate responsibility ser- vices). Our study covers all available responsibility reporting executed by Finnish-listed ﬁ rms during the research  period 2002–2005. In line with the GRI guidelines (www.globalreporting.org), responsibility reports are part of these ﬁ rms’ periodi- cal  reporting.  Despite  the  merits  of  GRI,  some  doubts  regarding  the  usefulness  of  the  GRI  guidelines  are  also  presented  (Vogel,  2005).  The  GRI  checklist  is  steadily  growing  and,  according  to  ﬁ nancial  analysts,  this  could  create difﬁ culties for the effective use of these reports (Greeves and Lapido, 2004). New light could be shed on  this issue by empirical investigation into the actual value-relevance of a GRI report to a ﬁ rm’s market value. There  is already evidence that environmental performance and the level of discretionary environmental disclosures (GRI- based measure) are positively associated (Clarkson et al., 2008). However, evidence for the value-relevance of GRI  is scant. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment    Corp. Soc. Responsib. Environ. Mgmt. 17, 96–106 (2010) DOI: 10.1002/csr Responsibility Reporting and Firm Value  99 The empirical motivation for this paper includes the increased demand to integrate responsibility into corporate  ﬁ nancial reporting as well as to further link it to responsibility performance and ﬁ rm value. Our speciﬁ c research  question is: How does communication via responsibility reporting affect ﬁ rm value? Responsibility Reporting and Valuation and Regression Models Our method applies the residual income valuation model presented in Ohlson (1995). We express the market value  of equity as a function of the book value of equity, accounting earnings, and responsibility reporting (GRI). The  last variable (GRI) is a proxy for other value-relevant information (Hassel et al., 2005). The ﬁ rst part of this section  will motivate the use of GRI in our model, and the second part will derive the model in detail. Our motivation for including the GRI variable in the valuation model is in line with the academic literature and  GRI developers as the following literature shows. Responsibility reporting is considered to have the potential to  provide critical information for investors that is normally absent from ﬁ nancial reports. This information completes  ﬁ nancial reports often with forward-looking information that can enhance the report users’ understanding of such  key value drivers as human capital formation, corporate governance, the management of environmental risks and  liabilities, as well as the capacity to innovate. (Eggles et al., 2001) Responsibility information is seen as relevant  both for understanding the external environment in which the company conducts its business and assessing the  elements that underpin the company’s competitive advantage. The  quality  of  responsibility  management  can  help  investors  to  distinguish  companies  that  are  efﬁ cient  and  well  positioned  to  protect  their  market  competitiveness.  Certain  speciﬁ c  factors  can  help  drive  a  company’s  value and, therefore, their disclosure is of interest to investors. These factors include a range of different compe- tencies, actions and liabilities. For investors, current reporting delivers insufﬁ cient information on the intangible  assets that may account for well over half the market’s capitalization today. As a result, investors are making deci- sions  based  on  incomplete  information  because  they  lack  disclosures  on  how  responsibility  enhances  value  creation. There is a growing body of evidence to support the assertion that responsibility can generate business beneﬁ ts.  There is, however, no irrefutable evidence of ‘cause and effect’. Nevertheless, there is some statistical evidence of  a link between responsibility performance and ﬁ rm value. Advocates of responsibility argue that companies with  good corporate governance and environmental and social performance deliver above-average ﬁ nancial returns and  share  performance.  Some  studies  have  demonstrated  a  statistical  link  between  responsibility  performance  and  share price (Graves and Waddock, 2000; Orlitzky et al., 2003). Greeves and Ladipo (2004) tested the value-relevance of responsibility reporting through an examination of the  ‘GRI pioneers’ i.e., the ﬁ rst companies to adopt the GRI guidelines. They compared the performance of these GRI  pioneers with that of the ‘non-GRI reporting’ companies in the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 1200 with respect to:  share price volatility (beta), ﬁ ve-year revenue growth, and ﬁ ve-year operating proﬁ t margins. Their analysis indi- cated  that  as  a  group,  the  early  adopters  of  the  GRI  had  on  average  marginally  lower  share-price  volatility  and  higher operating proﬁ t margins despite slower revenue growth. Moreover, they found that those companies which  not only refer to the GRI guidelines when preparing their responsibility reports but publish a detailed ‘GRI index’  have, on average, substantially lower share-price volatility and signiﬁ cantly higher proﬁ t margins, with marginally  higher revenue growth. Also, the organizations working toward the development of GRI reporting share the view that GRI has stock  market beneﬁ ts. For example, the GRI (2002) guidelines argue that one of their beneﬁ ts is: ‘Responsibility report- ing may reduce volatility and uncertainty in share price for publicly traded enterprises, as well as reducing the cost  of capital (GRI, 2002). Fuller and more regular information disclosure, including much of what analysts seek from  managers on an ad hoc basis, can add stability to a company’s ﬁ nancial condition by avoiding major swings in  investor behavior caused by untimely or unexpected disclosures.’ Overall, though scarce, the academic literature, together with organizations offering recommendations (such as  the GRI and PRI) share the view that high-quality GRI reporting will be beneﬁ cial for stock markets. This view is  supported  by  economics-based  voluntary  disclosure  theory,  where  ﬁ rms  seek  to  reveal  and  inform  their  Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment    Corp.

The empirical evidence for the factual  beneﬁ ts of better GRI reporting, however, remains relatively unaddressed as an issue in the academic literature.  This paper aims to contribute to ﬁ lling this void. In our valuation model, the market value of equity is a function of the book value of equity, accounting earnings,  and responsibility reporting (GRI). Our model for ﬁ rm value will be based on the seminal work by Ohlson (1995).  Since its introduction, it has been a highly inﬂ uential model in ﬁ rm valuation (Callen and Segal, 2005; Gregory  et al., 2005). An equity statement that has no income other than net income from the income statement is a clean- surplus  accounting  statement  (Penman,  2001).  Based  on  a  clean  surplus  accounting  relation,  it  is  possible  to  express a ﬁ rm’s security price as a function of the ﬁ rm’s book value of equity plus abnormal earnings as follows  (Dechow et al., 1999):   Pt = bt + a1xa t + a2vt  (1) where: t = xt − rbt−1, where abnormal earnings (= abnormal net income) equal current period’s earnings minus normal rate of  xa return for the equity capital b for the period t-1 Pt = market value of a company on date t α1 = ω/(1 + r − ω) α2 = (1 + r)/[(1 + r − ω)(1 + r − γ )] ν t = Et[xa t+1] − ωxa t t) and three parameters (ω, γ, and  The empirical implementation of the model requires three variables (bt, xt, and υ r) to be provided as inputs (Dechow et al., 1999). With regard to the variables, book value (bt) and earnings (xt) are  basically readily available. We, however, are primarily interested in examining how a ﬁ rm’s responsibility reporting  affects market value. Dechow et al. (1999) estimate the other information variable through markets’ consensus  forecast. In other words, analysts’ forecasts are meant to capture and reﬂ ect all value-relevant information in addi- tion  to  accounting  data.  Since  we  are  interested  in  only  one  part  of  the  other  information,  i.e.,  responsibility  reporting, we use the responsibility reporting variable GRI as a proxy for the other information variable υ t (Hassel  et al., 2005). This allows us to study the effect of GRI on market value. In the empirical implementation, following prior literature, we can apply a combination of values zero and one  for variables ω (abnormal earnings persistence parameter) and γ (‘other information’ persistence parameter). In  this case, we concentrate only on the parameter ω, since the other information variable (υ t) has been replaced with  the responsibility reporting variable. With parameter value one (persistent abnormal earnings) for ω in Equation  (1) results in the following earnings based valuation model Vt:   ω= → Vt 1 = b t + − − b t 1   t x r (2) Equation (2) shows the linkage between earnings based value Vt, book value and abnormal earnings. Finally, in  Equation (3), we can express market value of equity Pt as a function of earnings based value Vt and responsibility  reporting (GRI).   lnPt = β0 + β1lnVt + β2GRI  (3) For variables Pt and Vt a natural logarithm format was applied in an attempt to avoid the possibility of extreme  values contaminating the results. This regression model recognizes the theoretical relationship between market  value (Pt) and earnings based value (Vt). Finally, the model in Equation (3) allows us to study whether responsibility  reporting has incremental value-relevance. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment    Corp. Soc. Responsib. Environ. Mgmt. 17, 96–106 (2010) DOI: 10.1002/csr Responsibility Reporting and Firm Value  101 Institutional Setting For our research sample, we focus on Finland as it has a tradition of high-quality ﬁ nancial reporting (Lindahl and  Schadewitz, 2008). Additionally, the sample ﬁ rms were best able to implement new innovations or recommenda- tions in their ﬁ nancial reporting (recognized pioneers in responsibility-type reporting). This insight was gained in  collaboration with an environmental disclosure expert. The sample we use is all OMX-Helsinki-listed ﬁ rms that  have published GRI-based reports during the years 2002–2005. A  tradition  of  high-quality  accounting  means  reliable,  transparent  ﬁ nancial  reporting  and,  in  turn,  a  reliable  starting point for valuation purposes. The Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by Transparency International  and  Passau  University  (McAdam  and  Rummel,  2004;  http://transparency.org.)  ranks  countries.  In  the  2005  ranking, which included 159 countries, Finland was ranked second. A number of accounting studies (Ball et al., 2000; 2006; Pincus et al., 2002; Lara and Mora, 2004) have built  differential analysis around the distinction between code law and common law. According to these papers, account- ing is practiced differently in common law and code law countries. Common law is a market-oriented system (as  in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the USA) and code law is a planning-oriented system (as in Germany and Japan).  Finland is a code law country in this respect. Because northern European countries follow this tradition, the results  obtained could, in this respect, be generalized for other northern European countries. In several countries, national regulations speciﬁ cally requiring various types of environmental disclosure began  to  emerge  in  the  late  1990s  in  recognition  of  the  material  importance  of  environmental  risks  and  liabilities.  Denmark  and  the  Netherlands  became  the  ﬁ rst  two  countries  to  mandate  environmental  reporting  for  certain  industrial sectors. In 2003, the Netherlands upgraded its requirements to embrace the full spectrum of responsi- bility and align with the GRI’s framework. Economic regulations adopted in France in 2001 require listed com- panies to include detailed environmental and social information in their annual reports. The application of the International Accounting Standards (IAS) at EU level (EC Regulation No. 1606/2002)  requires  organizations  to  account  for  changes  to  asset  values  stemming  from  environmental  factors  if  they  are  ﬁ nancial (e.g., trading permits). The EU Modernization Directive (2003/51/EC) requires organizations seeking a  stock-market listing to disclose risks associated with capital assets and requires ﬁ nancial regulators to assess those  risks (in line with Commission Recommendation 2001/453/EC).1 Setting minimum mandatory standards for EU countries, the Accounts Modernization Directive (2003) requires  all large companies (not just quoted ones) and medium-sized companies to include a fair review of the develop- ment  and  performance  of  the  company’s  business  and  its  position  in  their  annual  reports,  including  –  ‘to  the  extent necessary for an understanding’ – information on environmental and employee matters. Large companies  are also expected to produce non-ﬁ nancial key performance indicators. The EU has, since January 2005, demanded  sustainable development disclosures from all member countries for all listed ﬁ rms. Several countries have trans- posed  the  directive  to  national  level.  In  2003,  the  Finnish  Accounting  Board  issued  a  general  guidance  on  the  recognition, measurement and disclosure of environmental issues as a part of a ﬁ nancial statement. In 2006, the  disclosure requirements were enlarged to the Review of the Board of Directors. The Finnish Accounting Board’s  general  guidance  (KILA  12.9.2006)  deﬁ nes  a  complete  set  of  environmental  and  social  performance  indicators  and related qualitative information to be disclosed in the Review of the Board of Directors when these issues are  material for business. The importance of the EU Accounting Directives has recently declined somewhat among listed companies. The  reason for this is that, as of 2005, these companies must prepare their consolidated ﬁ nancial statements according  to the IAS. Most of the issues regarding recognition and the measurement of environmental and social issues are  covered by IAS 16, 20, 36, 37 and 38, which have already been introduced to a certain degree in many countries.  In  IAS,  however,  responsibility  is  not  emphasized  as  a  special  area  and  is  addressed  along  with  other  issues.  Responsibility-related references are included in the IAS Standards 36 (Impairment of Assets), 37 (Provisions and  Contingent Liabilities) and 38 (Intangible Assets). Tradable emission rights will be reported on and accounted for  under IAS 38 and allocated free of charge under IAS 20, as government grants. 1 European Commission Recommendation of 30 May 2001 on the recognition, measurement and disclosure of environmental issues in the  annual accounts and annual reports of companies (2001/453/EC).

Niskala The content of responsibility-oriented ﬁ nancial reporting practices should generally improve with the application  of  IAS  and  additional  reporting  requirements  in  annual  reports.  Nonetheless,  important  concerns  remain.  The  data reported are not standardized, which can pose difﬁ culties for comparative reviews. Although the legal require- ment for companies to report on their environmental performance is rapidly increasing in Europe, the varying  degree and quality of local interpretation means that investors ﬁ nd it difﬁ cult to rely on information being quan- titative, comprehensive and comparable. There are no mandatory requirements for responsibility reporting in Finland. However, the GRI guidelines, as  a framework for voluntary responsibility disclosure, are well established in Finland. According to the environmen- tal  disclosure  expert,  GRI  guidelines  are  practically  the  only  guidance  followed  in  responsibility  reporting  in  Finland. Several companies regularly publish GRI responsibility reports. Based on the KPMG International Survey  of Corporate Responsibility Reporting (2005), Finland was one of the top countries for responsibility reporting  (KPMG, 2005). Data and Results The recognition of responsibility value drivers in our study is based on the GRI reports. GRI-based reporting began  in Finland in 2000, when the Kesko Group became the ﬁ rst Finnish-listed company to publish a responsibility  report following the GRI guidelines for the year 2000. More systematic GRI-based responsibility reporting prac- tices began to emerge after the launch of the second version of the GRI guidelines in 2002. That is also the ﬁ rst  year in the sample. Our data are intertemporal and cover annual and GRI-based responsibility reports for all OMX- Helsinki-listed ﬁ rms for the years from 2002 to 2005. The number of GRI-based responsibility reports increased  from 7 in 2002 to 15 in 2005. Seventeen (36.9%) of those reports had independent external assurance, where a  third party has reviewed the relevance and credibility of the disclosed information. Further, the number of reports  with explicit GRI content index was 37 (80.4%). In line with prior research, ﬁ nance and insurance sector ﬁ rms  are excluded. It should be mentioned that we searched for information on how the sample ﬁ rms have performed  regarding their ﬁ nancial reporting quality. We were also interested in forming a picture of GRI reporters’ overall reporting quality. We based our analysis  on success and public recognition in ﬁ nancial reporting competitions and rankings. The results of the three well- recognized rankings and ﬁ nancial reporting competitions (H&H Webranking (www.webranking.eu), Best Investor  Webpages Competition (www.talouselämä.ﬁ ; Talouselämä is a well-recognized business magazine in Finland), and  Company Disclosure and Financial Reporting Competition (www.omxnordicexchange.com)) gave us insight into  the GRI ﬁ rms’ overall reporting quality. In general, ﬁ rms publishing GRI reports performed very well in these  competitions. For example, 7 out of the 15 GRI ﬁ rms we use in our studies were in the top 10 in H&H Webranking  in  2002  and  2005.  In  the  Best  Investor  Webpages  Competition,  ﬁ rms  following  GRI  reporting  are  frequently  among the ﬁ nalists. With regard to the Company Disclosure and Financial Reporting Competition, the majority  of the awarded ﬁ rms were those following also GRI reporting (2003–2005). The overall performance of GRI ﬁ rms  in terms of reporting is strong.2 The descriptive statistics of the applied variables are displayed in Table 1. Variable Mean Std.

They  were thus eliminated (about 9% of the sample). The mean and standard deviations ﬁ gures in Table 1 are very close  between  the  market  value  variable  (Pt)  and  earnings-based  valuation  variable  (Vt).  The  same  is  also  true  of  the  median and other descriptive statistics values for Pt and Vt. The mean value of the GRI indicator variable at 0.127  shows that during the research period 2002 through 2005 only a relatively small fraction of listed ﬁ rms were active  in their responsibility reporting. At the beginning of the research, we had 46 GRI reporting ﬁ rm-year observations.  We then collected the main listed ﬁ rms from OMX Helsinki for the period 2001–2005. We also deﬁ ned variables  xt, bt, bt−1 and r. That leaves us with n = 354 (43 GRI reporting ﬁ rm-year observations and 311 others). For the pricing  model n = 276 (35 GRI ﬁ rm-year observations and 241 others). In the return computations we applied a market model; in other words returns were market and risk adjusted.  Risk-free return was computed on a yearly basis as a 12-month average ﬁ gure based on the Finnish government  bond rate (10 years maturity). Market model beta was based on daily data and market return was based on long- run  market  development  during  the  period  2002–2005.  In  order  to  restrict  the  potential  domination  of  larger  ﬁ rms, we applied a portfolio index where the maximum weight for one ﬁ rm was 10%. Throughout the years, the  risk-free rate and beta were allowed to change in order to compute the cost of equity capital consistent with the  market model. The book values of equities were based on ﬁ rms’ annual balance sheet information (accounting  year  end  values).  The  market  values  of  companies  are  year-end  market  capitalizations.  The  source  for  the  data  applied was Thomson Financial Services (commercially available). Table 2 shows that, overall, the share price is highly correlated with the value-based-on-earnings valuation model  (0.855). In contrast, the GRI variable is not so strongly correlated with a price variable (0.551) or earnings-based  value variable (0.509). However, it should be mentioned that in all cases the correlation level is statistically highly  signiﬁ cant. Visual inspection shows that there is no heteroscedasticity with the data. Furthermore, the data passed  the Gauss-Markov conditions. Regression  results,  based  on  Equation  (3),  are  reported  in  Table  3.  The  table  shows  that,  overall,  the  model  explained market valuation well, Adj. R2 being 74.7%. More importantly, the obtained results reported in Table 3  support the conclusion that GRI responsibility reporting has been beneﬁ cial for ﬁ rm value. Speciﬁ cally, the GRI  coefﬁ cient is high (0.792) and so is its statistical signiﬁ cance (1% level). We estimate the regression model also  without the GRI variable and discover, based on F-test, that the inclusion of GRI has incremental value (signiﬁ cance  1% level). The regression results are reported in Table 3, Panel B and F-test in Panel C. The  results  strongly  support  the  view  that  earnings  only  partially  capture  the  relevant  valuation  information.  This is in line with several recent studies that have raised concerns regarding earnings informativeness (Collins  et al., 1997). To be speciﬁ c, one of their fundamental ﬁ ndings was that the incremental value-relevance of ‘bottom  line’ earnings has declined, and it has been replaced by the increasing value-relevance of book values. Our model  takes both of these parameters, accounting earnings, and book values, into account. Despite that, the GRI variable  gained a highly signiﬁ cant coefﬁ cient. In other words, GRI responsibility disclosures have value-relevant informa- tion above and beyond that given in the earnings and book value. n = 276 Pt Vt GRI Pt 1 0.855*** 0.551*** Vt 1 0.509*** GRI 1 Table 2.

Conclusions In this paper, we ﬁ rst analyzed the responsibility reporting literature with an emphasis on the linkage between  reporting and ﬁ rm performance and ﬁ rm valuation. Based on the literature review, we developed a research ques- tion: How does the communication via responsibility reporting affect ﬁ rm value? The market valuation of listed  Finnish ﬁ rms through a conventional valuation model combined with responsibility reporting was analyzed. The  starting point for our valuation was the Ohlson model. We expanded upon the conventional valuation by studying  whether communication via responsibility reporting is related to a ﬁ rm’s valuation. Our research question is linked  to the broader academic question of whether earnings worth as an information source has been erased over the  last few years. In addition to that, we contribute to the literature that tries to understand the link between CSR  and  ﬁ rm  performance/share  performance.  Speciﬁ cally,  we  focused  on  responsibility  reporting  according  to  the  GRI and especially on whether the existence of those reports provides a further explanation for ﬁ rm value. Our sample was a population type that covered all listed Finnish ﬁ rms that have adopted GRI. No other respon- sibility reporting practice was used by listed ﬁ rms in their responsibility reporting communication during the years  2002–2005. The other necessary information for valuation models was obtained from Thomson Financial Services  (commercial database). The applied model supported the conclusion that communication via GRI responsibility reporting is an impor- tant explanatory factor for a ﬁ rm’s market value. The result indicates that responsibility reporting is a part of a  ﬁ rm’s communication tools in order to decrease information asymmetry between managers and investors. In other  words, GRI responsibility reporting is called for in order to produce a more precise market valuation of a ﬁ rm. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment    Corp. Soc.

Theoretically,  the  Ohlson model has gained wide support because it offers a sound theoretical relation between accounting informa- tion (especially earnings) and market value. The results show that other information – in this case GRI responsi- bility disclosures – contribute to the market value of a ﬁ rm. The contribution is beyond what earnings together  with book values can predict. In modern capital markets, a ﬁ rm’s share-price behavior is a highly important issue. In the long run, it is best  for all stakeholders that the share price correctly reﬂ ects the ‘true’ economic value of a ﬁ rm. Our results show that  managers can increase the informativeness of share prices via responsibility reporting. It is beneﬁ cial for ﬁ rms to  communicate GRI responsibility information as a part of their annual reporting practice. This research ﬁ nding  supports the conclusion that theory-based conventional valuation models can be reﬁ ned by explicitly taking into  account responsibility information in a ﬁ rm’s disclosures. The results obtained highlight the importance of responsibility disclosures for ﬁ rm value. Nowadays, responsi- bility reporting is conducted on a voluntary basis in Finland. However, the increased importance of responsibility  issues is also raising the demand for responsibility information. This, in turn, highlights the role of regulators in  this  important  reporting  issue.  Also  in  general  there  are  attempts  to  include  sustainability  concerns  in  policy  assessment  procedures  (Weaver  and  Jordan,  2008).  Our  hope  is  that  the  results  here  have  provided  additional  insight into this responsibility reporting issue and indicate that it has value relevance. This issue should also carry  weight for regulators and other policy when they execute their function. Because only a relatively small fraction of Finnish ﬁ rms publish responsibility reports, further research could  usefully study the major determinants for the reporting or non-reporting of responsibility information.
