COMPENSATION POLICY AND ORGANIZATIONAL  PERFORMANCE: THE EFFICIENCY,  OPERATIONAL, AND FINANCIAL  IMPLICATIONS OF PAY LEVELS AND PAY STRUCTURE  MARK P. BROWN  Bradley University  MICHAEL C. STURMAN  Cornell University  MARCIA J. SIMMERING  Louisiana Tech University  In this study, we investigated the relationship between organization-level compensa-  tion decisions and organizational performance. Specifically, we examined how com-  panies' pay structures and pay levels relate to resource efficiency, patient care out-  comes, and financial performance. We expected both nonlinear and interactive effects.  Results from a large database of hospitals support our predictions. We discuss the  implications for practice and compensation research theory development in light of  the study's results.  discuss how both pay characteristics operate simul-  taneously to affect organizational outcomes. We ex-  amined the independent and interactive effects of  these compensation elements on three types of or-  ganizational outcomes: resource efficiency (here,  the average length of a hospital patient's stay), pa-  tient care outcomes (adjusted coronary survival  rate), and organizational financial performance (re-  turn on assets). We tested our hypotheses using a  sample of 333 short-stay acute care hospitals.  ORGANIZATIONAL PAY CHARACTERISTICS  Human resource management practices in gen-  eral (e.g., Becker & Gerhart, 1996; Becker & Huselid,  1998; Huselid & Becker, 2000), and compensation  systems in particular (Banker, Lee, Potter, & Srini-  vasan, 1996; Becker & Gerhart, 1996; Becker &  Huselid, 1998; Shaw, Gupta, & Delery, 2002), have  been shown to be highly related to organizational  performance. Considering the importance and com-  plexities of compensation issues, though, more re-  search on the organizational performance implica-  tions of specific practices is still needed (Becker &  Gerhart, 1996; Becker & Huselid, 1998; Bloom,  1999; Bloom & Michel, 2002). The purpose of this  study was to investigate the relationship between  pay level, pay structure, and various measures of  organizational performance.  Pay Level  Pay level represents a firm's average compensa-  Both theory and empirical research suggest that  pay level and pay structure are each important for  understanding the organization-level implications  of pay policy. Furthermore, as any pay system is  characterized by both elements, it is essential to  Thanks to the State of California Office of Statewide  Health Planning and Development for providing the data  for this study.

An organization  with a policy of leading the market offers higher  than the average wage of the relevant labor market;  a policy of lagging the market signifies lower-than-  market-average wages, and a policy of matching the  market indicates wages at the relevant labor market  average.  Efficiency wage theory helps explain how pay  levels relate to organizational performance (Akerlof  & Yellen, 1986). Organizations with higher pay lev-  els should experience increases in both individual-  level and organization-level efficiency because  they are more able to attract, retain, and motivate This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:26:11 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  752  Hypothesis 1. There will be a positive relation-  ship between pay levels and resource effi-  ciency and a positive relationship between pay  levels and patient care outcomes.  Although enhanced resource efficiency and pa-  tient care outcomes should be associated with im-  proved financial performance, at some point, the  increased costs associated with paying higher com-  pensation will outweigh the efficiency and perfor-  mance benefits of higher pay levels. Although the  efficiency wage theory prediction is that higher pay  improves attraction, retention, and motivation,  there are limits to the extents to which selection  can be improved (owing to limits in validity and  selection ratios), turnover can be reduced, and mo-  tivation can be affected by pay. Consider an ex-  treme example: We would expect that paying  nurses at above-market levels would lead to im-  proved organizational outcomes, but the organiza-  tional benefits of paying nurses a million dollars  each will certainly not overcome the extreme effect  of such a policy on costs. We therefore expect that  leading the market by too much should be associ-  ated with negative financial performance. There-  fore, we predict:  Hypothesis 2. There will be an inverted  U-shaped relationship between pay levels and  an organization's financial performance: fi-  nancial performance will be lower with low  pay levels and lower with high pay levels.  Equity theory has been used to investigate the  performance effects of organizational pay struc-  tures. According to equity theory, employees eval-  uate "exchange relationships" on the basis of com-  parisons of their perceived ratios of inputs and  outputs to the perceived ratios of others' inputs and  outputs (Adams, 1965). When employees perceive  inequity (for instance, they see themselves as work-  ing harder than, but receiving less pay than, co-  workers), they may respond with a host of poten-  tially negative reactions in order to restore equity in  their exchange relationships. As it has been most  typically applied, equity theory suggests that  overly hierarchical pay structures can have dys-  functional consequences. As pay structures become  too hierarchical, organizational performance may  be adversely influenced because employees will  become less cooperative and less inclined toward  teamwork (Adams, 1965; Bloom, 1999; Pfeffer &  Langton, 1993; Main, O'Reilly, & Wade, 1993).  These negative consequences may be exacerbated if  a hierarchical structure becomes a means of signal-  ing organizational value, spawning feelings of so-  cial, psychological, and economic injustice among  employees (Bloom, 1999). While overly hierarchi-  cal pay systems should be associated with negative  organizational outcomes, equity theory also sug-  gests that overly egalitarian pay structures will be  similarly detrimental. Greater levels of knowledge,  skills, and abilities should be associated with  greater pay; thus, pay systems that provide insuffi-  cient differences for human capital could also yield  feelings of inequity on the parts of those with  greater levels of knowledge, skills, and abilities.  Hypothesis 3. Organizational performance (re-  source efficiency, patient care outcomes, and  financial performance) will have an inverted  U-shaped relationship with the degree of hier-  archy in a pay structure.  2003 Brown, Sturman, and Simmering 753  the best performers. High pay levels generate larger  applicant pools, which allow organizations to be  more selective when hiring (Williams & Dreher,  1992) and to retain highly qualified employees (Ak-  erlof & Yellen, 1986; Campbell, 1993). High pay  levels may also improve employee and resource  efficiency by decreasing employees' unproduc-  tive behaviors (Akerlof & Yellen, 1986). We thus  predict:  indicates a compressed pay distribution, or as hi-  erarchical, which indicates more widely dispersed  pay.  Pay Structures  In addition to a mean level of pay, an organiza-  tional pay plan is also characterized by its pay  structures, a term for the array of pay rates within  the organization and representing the degree of  slope in its pay policies (Milkovich & Newman,  2002). Characteristics of a particular pay structure  include the number of levels in the structure, the  size of the pay differentials between each level in  the structure, and the rate at which employees can  progress through each level in the structure (Ger-  hart & Milkovich, 1992). Pay structures can be  broadly characterized as egalitarian, a term that  Considering Pay Levels and Pay Structure  Simultaneously  Previous studies of compensation have typically  emphasized only one component of pay (e.g.,  Bloom, 1999; Bloom & Michel, 2002; Klaas &  McClendon, 1996). Yet, because pay level and pay  structure are both essential characteristics of a com-  pensation system, it is important to consider them  simultaneously in order to relate pay policy to or-  ganizational outcomes. Shaw, Gupta, and Delery  (2002) found that pay dispersion was neither inher- This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:26:11 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  754 Academy of Management Journal December  ently functional nor dysfunctional, but that its ef-  fectiveness depended on other situational factors.  We argue that pay level should be examined as one  of these factors.  efit accruing to egalitarian structures when  they lag the market, and to hierarchical struc-  tures when they lead the market.  Frank's (1985) work on employees' relative  standing suggests that workers may be more likely  to accept perceived inequality when they are paid  above their "marginal products," a term denoting  the value of their organizational contributions. In  overly hierarchical pay structures, lower-level em-  ployees may have feelings of inequity because of  their comparatively low pay. High pay levels may  alleviate these feelings of inequity (Bloom &  Michel, 2002). Thus, the effects of particular pay  structures on employee behaviors, exhibited  through resource efficiency and patient care out-  comes, should depend upon pay level. Specifically,  we expect to observe that the negative effects of  nonegalitarian pay structures will become smaller  as pay levels increase, and thus that egalitarian and  hierarchical pay systems will perform comparably  at high pay levels. Thus,  Hypothesis 4. The relationship between pay  structure and resource efficiency will be mod-  erated by pay level: pay structure will be less  strongly related to resource efficiency at higher  pay levels.  Hypothesis 5. The relationship between pay  structure and patient care outcomes will be  moderated by pay level: pay structure will be  less strongly related to patient care outcomes  at higher pay levels.  Interactive effects on financial performance are  somewhat harder to predict. The negative conse-  quences of an overly egalitarian or hierarchical pay  system should be offset somewhat by higher pay  levels; however, we must also consider the cost  implications of leading versus lagging the market.  Although an overly egalitarian pay structure would  be expected to be associated with negative resource  efficiency and patient care outcomes, a company  should save the most financial resources when lag-  ging the market with an egalitarian structure. Thus,  we expect higher financial performance in egalitar-  ian structures that lag the market than in egalitarian  structures that lead it. At the same time, leading  the market with a hierarchical pay system should  gain the benefits implied by efficiency wage theory,  and leading the market should offset the detriments  of an overly hierarchical pay system. Thus, we  predict:  Hypothesis 6. The relationship between pay  structure and financial performance will be  moderated by pay level, with the greatest ben-  METHODS  Sample  We employed data from the population of short-  term-stay, acute care, general hospitals in the state  of California. These are facilities with average  lengths of stay less of than 30 days that provide a  comprehensive range of services (Office of State-  wide Health Planning and Development [OSHPD],  1991). We drew the data from state-mandated  annual hospital disclosure reports provided to  OSHPD from 1991 to 1999. Of the 354 hospitals  that identified themselves as short-term-stay, acute  care general hospitals, we excluded approximately  6 percent because they showed extreme values on  some variables (values more than five standard de-  viations from the mean on the variable of interest).  A qualitative review indicated that these outliers  might have been consequences of coding mistakes  or inappropriate classifications (that is, the facili-  ties were not acute care hospitals), and so we elim-  inated affected facilities to ensure a more accurate  sample. We analyzed the resulting sample of 333  hospitals. Jobs in each hospital were grouped into  nine categories, with definitions mandated by Cal-  ifornia statutes: physicians, nonphysician medical  practitioners, managers and supervisors, techni-  cians and specialists, registered nurses, licensed  vocational nurses, aides and orderlies, clerical and  other administrative staff, and environmental and  food service staff.  Hospitals present a valuable opportunity for  studying the organizational performance effects of  compensation practices for several reasons. First,  over 50 percent of their expenditures are devoted to  salaries and benefits (American Hospital Associa-  tion, 1993; Langland-Orban, Gapenski, & Vogel,  1996), and we could expect notable variance in  how hospitals used pay to compete for employees.  Second, these hospitals all competed for similar  human capital, which allowed us to make pay com-  parisons across organizations. Furthermore, a focus  on short-term acute care hospitals eliminated con-  founds associated with sampling different types of  services, clients, or employees. Third, we had con-  fidence in the similarity of job categories across  organizations because of the highly structured re-  porting format required for certain jobs (nursing,  for instance) by the State of California. Fourth, hos-  pitals employ professionals and nonprofessionals,  allowing us to include both in this study to repre- This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:26:11 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2003 Brown, Sturman, and Simmering 755  sent organization-wide pay strategy and structure,  rather than focus on only a subset of employees, as  studies of pay dispersion have typically done (e.g.,  Bloom, 1999; Bloom & Michel, 2002; Shaw et al.,  2002).  Dependent Variables  Resource efficiency. To represent the efficiency  with which each organization used its resources,  we applied a metric of hospital efficiency common  in research on health care management: average  length of stay. The variable is the average number  of days patients stay in a particular hospital. As  Thomas (1997) noted, average length of stay has  often been used as a measure of hospital perfor-  mance in public data reports (e.g., Pennsylvania  Health Care Cost Containment Council, 2001;  Fromberg, 1991; Tauble, 1990) and in studies con-  ducted by vendors and purchasers to evaluate hos-  pital quality (e.g., Solucient, 2000). Typically, hos-  pitals with shorter lengths of stay are considered to  be more efficient in their use of resources (Thomas,  1997). Moreover, hospitals with shorter lengths of  stay have been found to be more profitable than  those with longer lengths of stay (Langland-Orban  et al., 1996), in part because fewer resources are  used for patient care. We calculated this variable by  dividing a hospital's total number of patient days  by its total number of discharges (MacEachern,  1962). We note, however, that despite the common  use of average length of stay as a measure of hos-  pitals' resource efficiency, quicker discharge of pa-  tients is but one dimension of hospital performance  and, indeed, good performance on this measure  could even be considered to be counter to deliver-  ing quality patient care. We thus also considered  the quality of hospitals' patient care and the overall  financial performance of hospitals.  Patient care outcomes. One important consider-  individual patient's characteristics, the expected  survival rate measure provides a means of compar-  ing patient treatment quality across hospitals that  takes into account the different severities of cases  observed by each hospital (Zach, Romano, & Luft,  1997). The data on the adjusted survival percentage  for heart attack patients were provided by the Cal-  ifornia Office of Statewide Health Planning and  Development in the California Hospital Outcomes  Project (Zach et al., 1997). Comparable databases  for other types of ailments or injuries are not yet  available for California hospitals.  Financial performance. We used return on as-  sets (ROA) to measure organizational financial per-  formance. ROA is the most ubiquitous measure of  organizational financial performance for strategy  studies evaluating this outcome (Venkatraman &  Ramanujam, 1986), and prior strategic human re-  source research suggests that ROA reflects the de-  gree to which cost-benefit considerations of human  resource programs influence organizations' achieve-  ment of their economic goals (Gerhart & Milkovich,  1990). This measure captures a hospital's ability to  both control its expenses and use its assets to generate  income (Lagland-Orban et al., 1996).  Independent Variables  Pay level strategy. We determined organiza-  tions' pay level strategies by averaging wages for  the hospitals' job categories. First, the average pay  for each job category was standardized. This proce-  dure yielded nine standardized variables per hos-  pital (one for physicians, one for nonphysician  medical practitioners, and so forth). Second, we  estimated a single variable representing pay level  strategy by computing the average of these nine  standardized scores. Thus, positive values signified  a strategy of leading the market, and negative val-  ues signified a strategy of lagging.  ation when examining hospital performance is the  effectiveness of patient treatment. Simply examin-  ing efficiency does not account for the quality of  care, which may suffer as efficiency increases.  Therefore, we examined each hospital's adjusted  coronary survival rate for heart attack patients as a  dependent variable. For each hospital, this variable  is equal to its risk-adjusted expected heart attack  death rate minus its actual heart attack death rate.  This variable measures the degree to which each  hospital performs better or worse than it was ex-  pected to perform (thus, positive values represent  higher performance). The State of California esti-  mates an expected survival rate for each hospital  that is based on each of its heart attack patients' risk  factors for a particular year. By incorporating each  We performed a number of alternative measure-  ments to ensure the accuracy of the measure we  ultimately employed. We computed the pay level  using an average of wages weighted by the total  number of hours worked in each job, but this pro-  duced essentially the same value as the unweighted  measure (r = .99). We also calculated the weighted  and unweighted measures with and without (1)  physicians and (2) nonphysician medical practitio-  ners and again found the resultant pay strategy  measures remained highly stable (all r's > .97). We  also found that each organization's wage strategy  was highly stable across all job categories. The stan-  dardized wage scores for each job category were  correlated from .50 to .80 with the other standard-  ized scores. Conceptually treating each job's pay This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:26:11 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  756 Academy of Management Journal December  level as an observation of each company's wage  strategy, our aggregate measure of pay level was  highly consistent (a = .93), and exploratory factor  analysis showed that the pay levels from the differ-  ent categories loaded on a single dimension (the  eigenvalue was 4.91 for factor 1 and 0.55 for factor  2). Thus, the hospitals appeared to have unified  pay policies that they consistently employed across  the job categories.  mance (Gardiner et al., 1996). Profit status (coded  here as "for profit," 1, and "not for profit," 0) may  also explain differences among the hospitals on the  dependent variables owing to differences in finan-  cial structures or level of innovation (Goes & Park,  1997).  Pay dispersion. We captured pay dispersion us-  We also sought to control for the intensity of  staffing in each hospital. Hospitals' staffing levels  are measured using the number of full-time equiv-  alents (FTEs) per patient bed. One FTE represents  2,080 worked hours per year. Prior research indi-  cates that staffing levels may influence hospitals'  performance because hospitals with lower staffing  levels may have both lower employee satisfaction  and an increased incidence of employee perfor-  mance errors (e.g., Needleman, Buerhaus, Mattke,  Stewart, & Zelevinsky, 2001). We also controlled  for each hospital's unionization status, since the  presence of collective bargaining units may relate  to hospitals' performance (e.g., Seago & Ash, 2002).  Unionization ("unionized" - 1, "not unionized" =  0) data were gathered through telephone interviews  with each hospital in the sample.  ing "gini" coefficients. Recently, management re-  searchers have suggested (e.g., Gerhart & Milkov-  ich, 1992) and employed (e.g., Bloom, 1999; Bloom  & Michel, 2002; Shaw et al., 2002) these statistics  for investigating pay dispersion. Gini coefficients  can be calculated with individual- or subpopulation-  level data (Dagum, 1997). For this study, we fol-  lowed the subpopulation approach to calculation  and used average wage values at the job category  level. We calculated a separate gini coefficient for  each hospital for each year, following the formula  presented in Bloom (1999): gini coefficient = 1 +  1/n - (2/n2y) (y, + 2y2 + ... + nyn), where y, ...  y, is a sequence of the average salaries for the job  categories in hospital j arranged in decreasing order  of size, y is the mean of the average salary values for  each job category in hospital j, and n is the number  of job categories in hospital j. Gini coefficients can  theoretically range from 0 (indicating a totally egal-  itarian pay structure) to 1 (for a totally hierarchical  structure). Again, we ascertained the stability of  our compensation measure by performing a num-  ber of alternative analyses with and without physi-  cians and nonphysician medical practitioners in-  cluded in the calculation of the gini coefficient. As  with the pay level strategy measure, the results of  the alternative calculations were very similar to  those for the measure reported here (r's > .82).  To control for cost of living, which may affect  organizational pay policy, we included the median  housing values for the county in which each hos-  pital operated using data gathered from the Demo-  graphic Research Unit of the California Department  of Finance. To control for characteristics of the  patient market, we included each hospital's per-  centage of Medicare patients, percentage of Medic-  aid patients, and percentage of third-party payer  patients (third parties included indemnities and  HMOs). These are presented as percentages of each  hospital's total patient days. We also used an  OSHDP measure called the case mix index, which  controls for differences in the intensity of resource  utilization by each hospital's patient populations.  To calculate this index, the OSHDP initially assigns  each patient to one of over 500 diagnosis-related  groups (DRGs) on the basis of his or her principal  and secondary diagnoses, age, the procedures per-  formed, the presence of complications, discharge  status, and gender. Each DRG has a numeric weight  reflecting the national average hospital resource  consumption by patients for that DRG relative to  the national average hospital resource consump-  tion of all patients. Case mix index is calculated by  averaging the DRG weights of a hospital's patients  discharged within the calendar year. Thus, this  measure represents the average severity of the con-  ditions of the patients treated in a hospital and  controls for hospital costs that may be higher owing  to more severe illnesses. Because the OSHDP did  not start calculating case mix until 1995, we used  each hospital's average case mix value from 1995 to  Control Variables  We used a number of variables to control for  organizational characteristics, labor market influ-  ences, and the patient market. Time effects were  also controlled for via a dummy variable for each of  the years of data. Ownership status-coded as 1 for  private or 0 for public-may be related to hospital  performance (Goodstein & Boeker, 1991); studies  have found that a larger number of indigent pa-  tients are treated in public hospitals, which engen-  ders outcomes related to measures of firm perfor-  mance (Billings, Zeitel, Lukomnik, & Carey, 1993;  Gardiner et al., 1996; Goes & Park, 1997). Hospital  size, measured as number of staffed beds, may ex-  plain differences on the dependent variables, be-  cause it may be related to resources and perfor- This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:26:11 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2003 Brown, Sturman, and Simmering 757  1998 to represent the severity of the cases typically  seen by each hospital.

Analyses  To analyze the data, we pooled longitudinal  cross-sections composed of unbalanced panel data  from the 333 hospitals. The number of observations  per hospital ranged from 1 to 9, with a mean of 7.2.  A total of 2,410 observations were used in the anal-  yses. We examined the effect of the pay policy and  control variables at time T on organizational per-  formance at time T. We chose to use the same time  period for both the independent and dependent  variables because each variable captures the re-  sults, conditions, or policies in place over the en-  tire year studied. Thus, the pay policy variables  capture how employees were paid over all of time  T, which should most directly affect the resultant  performance of employees during time T.  Because curvilinear relationships are easily mis-  taken for interaction effects (Cortina, 1993), we fol-  lowed a procedure proposed by Cortina in which  potential curvilinear relationships are controlled in  each model. In the regression analyses, we entered  the control variables in the first step, the pay dis-  persion and pay level "main effects" in the second  step, the curvilinear (squared) pay dispersion and  Because we had multiple observations from each  hospital, we performed a number of alternative  analyses to test the stability of our results. In addi-  tion to ordinary least squares regression analyses,  we performed regressions with (1) dummy vari-  ables representing each hospital and (2) a random-  effects model. In all cases, the results were substan-  tially similar to the OLS regression results; in all  cases, the independent variables of interest that  were significant in the OLS model were significant  and in the same direction in the alternative models  (at p < .05 or better). For ease of interpretation, we  report the OLS results below.  RESULTS  Table 1 presents descriptive statistics and corre-  lations for all study variables.

A lower average length of stay represents  greater efficiency. The model includes dummy variables repre-  senting the four different years (not shown above). For owner-  ship, 1 = private, 0 = public; for profit status, 1 = for-profit, 0 =  not-for-profit. Size was the logarithm of the number of staffed  beds. Median housing value was also transformed using a  natural logarithm. Pay dispersion was measured with a gini  coefficient.  tp < .10  *p < .05  ** p < .01  ships in the data that, although not the focus of this  paper, do merit some discussion. For example,  unionization status was positively related to pay  level (r = .26, p < .0001) and negatively related to  pay dispersion (that is, to a more egalitarian disper-  sion: r = -.05, p < .05). Unionized hospitals also  had more FTEs per bed (r = .16; p < .0001). The  number of FTEs per bed was also related to all three  outcomes, showing negative correlation with aver-  age length of stay (r = -.24, p < .0001) and positive  correlation with adjusted survival (r = .14, p <  .0001) and ROA (r = .19, p < .0001).  Tables 2 through 4 summarize the results of the  pooled hierarchical regression analyses on average  length of stay, adjusted coronary survival, and  ROA. Results indicate that the inclusion of the pay  variables (steps 2 through 4) explained significant  variance in organizational performance. For aver-  age length of stay, the pay-related variables in-  creased the variance explained (total R2) by the  model by 7 percent; for adjusted coronary survival,  they explained an additional 4 percent of the vari-  ance; and for ROA, an additional 2 percent.  The results provide support for the first hypoth-  esis. Pay level is negatively associated with average  length of stay-that is, higher pay levels are asso-  ciated with greater efficiency-and pay level is pos-  itively associated with patient care outcomes. In-  terestingly, as the results in the third steps of  Tables 2 and 3 show, these effects are nonlinear.  Furthermore, all three models support the moder-  ation of pay level by pay dispersion.  Given these statistical findings, it is difficult to  ascertain support for the hypotheses. To better il-  lustrate the implications of the regression results,  we plotted the relationships of the pay level and  the organizational performance variables, with sep-  arate lines representing the different levels of pay  dispersion. The plotted lines represent the values  expected on the basis of the results from the fourth  steps 4 in Tables 2 through 4. The low pay disper-  sion lines are represented by using the predicted  results from the tables with a gini coefficient that is  one standard deviation below the mean. The mean  gini coefficient is used to represent the average  pay dispersion, and a gini one standard deviation  above the mean is used to represent a more hierar-  chical pay structure. Figure 1 graphically supports  Hypothesis 1. As pay levels increase, for all pay  hierarchies, the expected resource efficiency im-  proves (that is, average length of stay decreases),  and patient care outcomes increase. Furthermore,  as pay levels increase, diminishing returns from  greater compensation are exhibited.  The results do not support Hypothesis 2. As  shown in Table 4, pay level did not explain signif-  icantly more variance in ROA either linearly or  nonlinearly (in either step 2 or 3). In step 4 of the  regression, although the interaction term was sig-  nificant and added explanatory power, Figure 1  does not reveal the inverted U-shaped relationship  between pay level and ROA predicted in Hypothe-  sis 2. The analysis also left Hypothesis 3 unsup-  ported. For all of the tables, in step 3 the coefficient  of the squared pay dispersion term does not reach  significance (at p < .05). In fact, the pay dispersion  term is only marginally significant (p < .10) in step This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:26:11 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2003 Brown, Sturman, and Simmering 759  TABLE 3  TABLE 4  Results of Regression Analysis: Effects of Pay  Dispersion and Pay Level on Adjusted  Coronary Survivala  Variables Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4  Results of Regression Analysis: Effects of Pay  Dispersion and Pay Level on Return on Assetsa  Variables Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4  Step 1: Control  Step 1: Control  Profit status 1.42** 1.41** 1.33** 1.32**  Ownership 0.25 0.27 0.13 0.20  Size 0.96** 0.85** 0.74** 0.75**  Median housing value -0.64 -1.29* -1.15* -1.09*  Percent Medicare -4.61** -4.93** -4.95** -4.68*  Percent Medicaid -5.11** -5.18* -4.72* -4.53*  Percent Third-party -3.27* -3.65* -3.59 -3.37*  Case mix -2.05** -2.11** -1.98** -2.10**  Unionized -0.26 -0.37 -0.35 -0.36  Full-time equivalents 0.44** 0.41** 0.40** 0.41"*  Profit status 0.03** 0.03** 0.03** 0.03**  Ownership -0.02** -0.02** -0.02** -0.02**  Size 0.04** 0.04** 0.04** 0.04**  Median housing value 0.00 -0.01 0.00 0.00  Percent Medicare 0.10** 0.10"* 0.10"* 0.10**  Percent Medicaid 0.16** 0.16** 0.17** 0.17**  Percent third-party 0.01 0.01 0.01 0.01  Case mix -0.02 -0.02 -0.02 -0.02  Unionized 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00  Full-time equivalents 0.02** 0.02** 0.02** 0.02**  per bed  per bed  Step 2: Linear effects  Pay level 2.63* 3.18* 10.12*  Pay dispersion 2.87 8.37 9.27  Step 3: Nonlinear effects  Pay level squared -10.99* -11.88**  Pay dispersion squared -9.88 -9.74  Step 4: Interaction  Pay level x pay -30.60*  dispersion  Overall adjusted R2 .08 .08 .10 .12  Change in R2 .00 .02** .02**  Step 2: Linear effects  Pay level 0.02 0.02 -0.30**  Pay dispersion -0.07 -0.20 -0.53  Step 3: Nonlinear effects  Pay level squared -0.14' -0.07  Pay dispersion squared 0.25 0.90  Step 4: Interaction  Pay level x pay 1.42**  dispersion  Overall R2 .12 .12 .12 .14  Change in R2 .00 .00 .02**  an = 2,410.

Despite the failure to confirm Hypotheses 2 and  3, the results obtained after including the interac-  tion term did support the remaining three hypoth-  eses.

Furthermore, Figure  1 supports the specific predictions of the hypothe-  ses.

DISCUSSION  In this study, we sought to investigate the or-  ganizational performance implications of pay struc-  tures and pay level. As predicted, our results indicate  that pay level practices and pay structures interact to  affect resource efficiency, patient care outcomes, and  financial performance. Overall, our results demon-  strate the importance of considering the different el-  ements of a compensation plan when considering the  relationship between pay systems and organizational  performance. Additionally, our findings indicate the  importance of concurrently considering pay level  strategy and pay structure decisions.  The effects we observed also suggest that no sin-  gle theory can fully explain how compensation re- This content downloaded from 131.193.20.83 on Thu, 03 Aug 2017 01:26:11 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  760 Academy of Management Journal December  Relationship between Pay Level and Organizational Performance for Different Degrees of Pay Dispersion  FIGURE 1  Average  Length  of  Stay  Adjusted  Coronary  Survival  11-  10-  9-  8-  7-  6-  5-  4-  1-  0-  -1-  -2-  -3-  -4-  -5-  0.05-  0.04-  0.03-  ROA  0.02-  0.01-  0-  -0.01-  -2 -1 0 1 2  Hierarchical Pay System  Average Pay System  -2 -1 0'1 2'  Egalitarian Pay System  -2 -1 0 i i  Pay Level  Matching  the  Market  Leading  the  Market  Lagging  the  Market  lates to organizational performance. Our results  provide support for efficiency wage theory and  Frank's (1985) work on employees' relative stand-  ing. Efficiency theory was supported in that high  pay was associated with better levels of resource  efficiency; however, our results suggest that there  are diminishing returns for pay's effect on em-  ployee performance. We argue that there exist lim-  its to how much selection can be improved, turn-  over can be reduced, and motivation can be  increased by pay; thus, while higher pay is associ-  ated with our hypothesized benefits, such effects  do not appear to be linear.  tional outcomes are particularly noteworthy. These  findings highlight the importance of considering all  aspects of compensation policy simultaneously  when determining its effects. For the prediction of  ROA specifically, failure to have included the in-  teraction would have led to the erroneous conclu-  sion that compensation plan characteristics were  not related to financial performance; only consid-  eration of the interaction revealed the effect of pay  policy on compensation. Furthermore, the interac-  tion findings support Bloom and Michel's (2002)  proposition that higher wages can compensate for  the negative effects of inequitable pay systems.

For example, al-  though the labor intensiveness of hospitals created a  valuable environment in which to test the effects of  compensation policies, and although hospitals are a  work environment where even the lowest-level em-  ployees can have a notable impact on patient care  (Langland-Orban et al., 1996), labor costs in hospitals  are also a much greater portion of total costs than they  are for many other industries.  tems reflect an overall system of human resources.  Although data sets like that provided by the OSHDP,  the CAHRS (Center for Advanced Human Resource  Studies) database (cf. Bloom & Michel, 2002), and  Standard & Poor's ExecuComp database all have  their limitations, they allow for sophisticated in-  vestigations of topics of critical interest to theory  and practice and should be used to further inves-  tigate compensation policy research questions.  REFERENCES  Although our measure of resource efficiency, aver-  age length of stay, is a commonly used measure of  hospital performance, it is not without limitations.  Conventionally, average length of stay is viewed as a  measure of hospitals' efficiency. However, low aver-  age stays may represent hospitals' efforts to lower  costs and increase profits by prematurely discharging  patients (Thomas, 1997). Although this explanation  must be considered, robust findings at the individual  patient level of a relation between average length of  stay and multiple indicators of quality of care suggest  otherwise. For instance, at the level of the individual  patient, Thomas (1997) found that lower average  length of stay indicated higher-quality care for a range  of 13 clinical conditions investigated. Moreover, the  negative correlation between average length of stay  and adjusted mortality in our study appears to sug-  gest that shorter stays were not compromising patient  care in any obvious way.

We were able to determine  whether each hospital had a collective bargaining  unit present or not; however, we were unable to  collect data on the extent to which the employee  population at each hospital was represented by the  collective bargaining unit. Our results suggest that  unionization is a correlate of compensation charac-  teristics, but we found no evidence of its direct  effect on organizational outcomes after controlling  for the other variables in our study. We acknowl-  edge, though, that this may be a result of the mea-  sure's coarseness, and it may be valuable for future  research to specifically investigate whether union-  ization influences organizational performance.
