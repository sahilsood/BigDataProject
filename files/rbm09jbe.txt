Although a number of studies have shown that corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities often lead to greater organisational performance in western developed economies, researchers are yet to examine the strategic value of CSR in emerging economies. Using survey data from 280 firms operating in Dubai, this study examines the link between CSR activities and organisa- tional performance. The results show that CSR has a positive relationship with all three measures of organisa- tional performance: financial performance, employee commitment, and corporate reputation. These results reinforce the accumulating body of empirical support for the positive impact of CSR on performance and chal- lenge the dominant assumption that, given the weak institutional framework in emerging economies, CSR activities drain resources and compromise firms’ com- petitiveness. KEY WORDS: corporate social responsibility, organi- sational performance, emerging economies, United Arab Emirates Over the years, an enormous body of literature has emerged concerning the link between corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives and organisa- tional performance (Margolis and Walsh, 2003; McWilliams et al., 2006). Although extant research has made some headway in understanding the asso- ciation between CSR and organisational perfor- mance, two important limitations that we seek to address in this paper. First, extant research on the impact of CSR on organisa- tional performance has focused exclusively on from at least it suffers western developed economies. To date, scholars have not examined the strategic value of CSR in emerging economies. The limited body of research on CSR in emerging economies has focused almost exclusively on corporate citizenship, corporate irresponsibility, and motives for CSR in these countries (Blowﬁeld and Frynas, 2005; Frynas, 2005; Pedersen and Huniche, 2006). While these studies are valuable, they do not inform us of the strategic value of CSR in these countries. In this paper, we aim to close this gap by focusing on the strategic value of CSR in emerging economies, using ﬁrm-level data collected from ﬁrms operating in Dubai. Given that ﬁrms in emerging economies are embedded in different business systems from those of western ﬁrms, research on the associa- tion between CSR and organisational performance in emerging economies is warranted (Aguilera et al., 2007; Campbell, 2006). Compared with those in western countries, institutional legal frameworks in emerging economies are not yet well developed, which can limit the extent to which ﬁrms can beneﬁt from their CSR efforts. In addition, an extensive body of literature argues that managerial values and attitudes towards CSR in a given institutional context are likely to have a strong inﬂuence on the outcomes of such initiatives (Aguilera et al., 2007; Frynas, 2005; Hay and Gray, 1974; Hemingway and Maclagan, 2005; Pedersen and Huniche, 2006; Vitell and Paolillo, 2004). In this paper, we focus speciﬁcally on fast developing regions in emerging economies. Fast developing regions are quickly growing commercial and industrial hubs within emerging economies that have achieved high economic growth rates. We 372 Belaid Rettab et al. emphasise the focus on fast developing regions be- cause we believe that there are signiﬁcant differences between regions within emerging economies in terms of economic growth, business environments, income levels, and management practices. Although differ- ences between regions do exist in developed econo- mies, we believe these differences are more prominent in emerging economies. For instance, there are con- siderable differences between Dubai and the rest of UAE in the way the Dubai economy is run, the magnitude of economic and social changes, the level of the intensity of competitive environment, and the dom- inant aggressive business and management culture. internationalisation of business activities, Second, for example, as for the potential although researchers have provided convincing arguments strategic beneﬁts of CSR activities, scholars have not reached a consensus on whether or not, and how, CSR affects organisational performance (Husted and Allen, 2007; Margolis and Walsh, 2003; Orlitzky et al., 2003). They disagree, to whether CSR has a positive or a negative impact, or a neutral impact on organisational performance (Margolis and Walsh, 2001; McWilliams and Siegel, 2000; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wright and Ferris, 1997). A number of scholars have argued that the lack of consensus is due partly to the use of ques- tionable measures of organisational performance (Carroll, 1991; Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997; Waddock and Graves, 1997; Wokutch and McKinney, 1991). In particular, scholars highlight the limitations of single measures of performance (Egri et al., 2004) and over-reliance on ﬁnancial performance that, in isolation, does not capture the full impact of CSR on the ﬁrm’s overall performance (Husted and Allen, 2007). In this study, we address this issue with three measures of organisational performance: the oft-used ﬁnancial performance measure, as well as employee commitment and corporate reputation. This study is important for two reasons. First, while the study of the relationship between CSR and organisational performance is important in its own right regardless of ﬁrms’ location, it is of par- ticular relevance in fast developing regions of emerging economies given the immense impact that ﬁrms located in these regions have on the environ- ment because of the high level of energy they need. Indeed, Parry et al. (1998, p. 741) noted that ‘‘most future growth in emissions is expected to occur in the fast-developing regions of Asia and Latin America’’. In addition, ﬁrms operating in these regions may resort to unethical practices because of pressure to achieve short-term ﬁnancial results and sustain a global competitive edge. Second, as stated above, although the association between CSR and ﬁrm performance has been extensively debated, it is still not well understood. In this paper, we reﬁne the stream of research on the association between CSR and organisational performance by moving from the broad question of whether CSR has an impact on performance to a study of the association of CSR with three speciﬁc aspects of organisational perfor- mance: ﬁnancial performance, employee commit- ment, and corporate reputation. The remainder of the paper is structured as fol- lows. We begin this study by reviewing extant lit- erature on the relationship between CSR and organisational performance. We then propose a set of hypotheses pertaining to the nature of the impact of CSR on organisational performance in emerging economies. Next, we discuss the measures used in the study and describe the data collection method. We then report the results of the survey that tests the hypotheses. We conclude by discussing the ﬁndings, highlighting the key limitations of the study, and providing guidance for further research. Literature review and research framework CSR and organisational performance Signiﬁcant efforts have been made to understand the impact of CSR activities on organisational perfor- mance (Grifﬁn and Mahon, 1997; Husted and Allen, 2000; Husted and Salazar, 2006; Marom, 2006; McWilliams and Siegel, 2001; Moneva et al., 2007; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Salzman et al., 2005; Schuler and Cording, 2006; Swanson, 1995, 1999; Waddock and Graves, 1997; Windsor, 2001; Wood, 1991; Wood and Jones, 1995; Wright and Ferris, 1997). Our review of some of the key studies on the rela- tionship between CSR and organisational perfor- mance indicates positive, negative, mixed, or non-signiﬁcant results (see Table I). The review shows that while a number of studies reported a negative relationship (Vance, 1975), or no signiﬁcant relationship (Aupperle et al., 1985; Davidson and A Study of Management Perceptions of the Impact of CSR 373 Relationship between corporate social responsibility and ﬁnancial performance TABLE I Measure Study Positive relationship Bowman (1976) Clarkson (1988) Cottrill (1990) Dooley and Lerner (1994) Fry et al.

Pava and Krausz’s (1995) comprehensive review of empirical studies of the relationship between CSR and organisational performance found that, overall, ﬁrms perceived as having met social responsibility criteria have either outperformed or performed as well as other ﬁrms that are not necessarily socially responsible. Such positive relationship has also been supported by a recent meta-analysis of the relation- ship between CSR and organisational performance (Orlitzky et al., 2003). However, as noted above, one cannot generalise the above ﬁndings from western developed economies to emerging econo- mies without further research. Business system the- that countries have ory (Whitley, 1992) holds different business systems. Therefore, it stands to reason that in order to hypothesise a relationship between CSR and organisational performance in emerging economies it is important to understand the institutional and managerial characteristics of these economies. The institutional environment in fast developing economies like Dubai is driven by policies that promote high economic growth and international competitiveness, but if not properly managed, may lead to social inequality, poor labour practices, and enormous environmental damage. Dubai has sustained a period of rapid growth during the last three decades, moving from an ob- scure semi-nomadic emirate to a global commercial hub that has recently built up signiﬁcant competitive advantages. Dubai’s growth has been prompted by two main factors. The ﬁrst is ambitious and visionary leadership, and the second is an aggressive open market strategy. The fast growth in the economy, generated by extensive factor inputs, has resulted in unequal welfare distribution and unlimited market opportunities for opportunistic behaviour. Business media are replete with anecdotal examples of unscrupulous ﬁrms resorting to socially irresponsible practices to achieve high proﬁts at the expense of employee welfare, customer safety, and the environment. These prac- tices range from mistreatment of workers to dis- honesty with customers. Scholars argue that the weak enforcement of laws and regulations gives the impression that ﬁrms can get away with socially created high incentives that A Study of Management Perceptions of the Impact of CSR 375 irresponsible actions (Mellahi, 2007). Although the government introduced a number of laws to regulate ﬁrms’ conduct, much hinges on the institutional capacity regulations (Mellahi, 2007; North, 1990). and enforce to monitor supportive institutions the will of political actors A number of scholars (Campbell, 2006; Gala- skiewicz, 1991; Mellahi, 2007) argue that while negative sanctions enforced through regulation may constrain and discourage ﬁrms from acting in a socially irresponsible manner, adherence to socially responsible behaviour develops from the presence of such as business and industrial associations that are able to mobilise and entice ﬁrms to subscribe voluntarily to CSR. Thus, in spite of in most such as China, India, and emerging economies UAE to promote CSR initiatives to mitigate harmful consequences of fast economic growth on pollution, customer protection, and labour prac- tices, CSR remains a low priority in these countries compared with western developed countries. Fur- ther, there is a lack of favourable institutions con- ducive to the practice of CSR. For instance, absence of non-governmental institutions and social associations capable of raising social expectations and exerting pressure on ﬁrms does not motivate ﬁrms to adopt CSR activities. Below we hypoth- esise the relationship between CSR and ﬁnancial performance, CSR and employee commitment, and CSR and corporate reputation. CSR and ﬁnancial performance Financial performance is one of the most studied indicators of the strategic value of CSR (Orlitzky et al., 2003). Margolis and Walsh’s (2001) meta- analysis found that 55% of the 160 studies examined identiﬁed a positive relationship between CSR and ﬁnancial performance, 22% reported no relationship, 18% found a mixed relationship, and 4% a negative relationship. Orlitzky et al. (2003) conducted another meta-analysis and found similar results. These studies lend credence to the widely accepted notion that being socially responsible would, in most cases, improve a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance. Indeed, Aguilera et al. (2007) recently called for closure of the debate on the relationship between CSR and ﬁnancial is performance, there arguing that overwhelming evidence of a positive and signiﬁcant association between the two. (Allouche A number of arguments and rationales have been advanced as to why CSR has a positive impact on ﬁnancial performance and Laroche, 2006). One of the prominent arguments is that the ways in which a ﬁrm satisﬁes its stakeholders and communicates CSR activities to stakeholders can affect its ﬁnancial performance. Orlitzky et al. (2003, p. 405) noted that ‘‘the satisfaction of vari- ous stakeholder groups is instrumental for organi- sational ﬁnancial performance’’. Therefore, one could argue that in emerging economies, the link between CSR and a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance is contingent on stakeholders’ perceptions of and subsequent reactions to CSR efforts. Stakeholders’ reaction to CSR efforts is mediated by the avail- ability and intensity of information on CSR ini- tiatives and preferences of stakeholders relative to available alternatives (Schuler and Cording, 2006). Hartman et al. (2007) argued that notwithstanding the motivation for the engagement, ﬁrms must ultimately communicate their rationale for CSR engagement to stakeholders. Overall, ﬁrms in emerging economies do not appreciate the critical importance of communicating their CSR activities to stakeholders (Foo, 2007; Wright et al., 2003). In the case of Dubai, factors contributing to ineffective engagement with stake- holders and lack of communication of CSR activities include the following:1 lack of effective communi- cation channels with stakeholders; failure to manage stakeholders strategically or to make stakeholder management an organisational priority among ﬁrms with a monopoly position in the UAE market; dif- ﬁculty in communicating with stakeholders because of the diversity of interests and cultural backgrounds of (temporary migration in Dubai exceeds 80% of the local population); and inability to build long-term relationships and trust because of high turnover of managers and employees resulting from a turbulent labour market. stakeholders These factors minimise stakeholders’ needs and result in reluctance of ﬁrms to engage in CSR activities that might be perceived as having little beneﬁt for stakeholders. Further, because of the lack of communication platforms to disseminate infor- mation about CSR activities, CSR efforts often go unnoticed and are largely unknown to stakeholders 376 Belaid Rettab et al. that a ﬁrm’s social and subsequently may not have an impact on performance. Further, Mellahi and Wood (2003) argued that because stakeholders are often not aware of CSR activities in emerging economies, CSR activities may even have a negative impact on ﬁnancial performance. Foo (2007) argued that CSR puts social constraints on ﬁrms that may be in con- ﬂict with the pursuit of ﬁnancial gains. While the above discussion suggests that ﬁrms in emerging economies may not be rewarded for their CSR initiatives even when they take serious steps towards CSR, we argue that stakeholders do not react negatively towards ﬁrms that engage in CSR activities for two key reasons. First, based on the above discussion, one would assume that in emerging economies stakeholders are not fully aware of ﬁrms’ CSR activities and therefore ﬁrms will not be rewarded or punished for their CSR efforts. Second, as a consequence of the strong economic growth, most ﬁrms have ample resources at their disposal to divert to SCR activities. Therefore, on balance one could argue that ﬁrms are able to engage in CSR activities without damaging their ﬁnancial health but also without reaping rent-like advantages from their CSR initiatives (Schuler and Cording, 2006). Based on the above, we propose the following hypothesis. H1: CSR is not positively related to ﬁnancial performance in emerging economies. CSR and employee commitment Broadly deﬁned, employee commitment refers to ‘‘the extent to which a business unit’s employees are fond of the organisation, see their future tied to that of the organisation, and are willing to make personal sacriﬁces for the business unit’’ (Jaworski and Kohli, 1993, p. 60). Aguilera et al. (2007) noted that employees make judgments about their employer’s CSR efforts based on their observations of the ﬁrm’s CSR actions, outcomes of the CSR actions, and the handling of the implementation process. The authors posit that ‘‘socially responsible or irresponsible acts are of serious consequences to employees’’ (p. 843). A number of studies have explored the link between CSR and employee commitment (Albinger and Freeman, 2000; Backhaus et al., 2002; Greening and and Rodrigues Turban, 2000; Maignan et al., 1999; Peterson, 2004; Turban and Greening, 1997). Overall past research shows responsibility actions matter to its employees (Albinger and Freeman, 2000; Backhaus et al., 2002; Greening and Turban, 2000; Peterson, 2004; Turban and Greening, 1997), and tend to have a positive impact on employees’ commitment. Branco (2006) reported that ﬁrms perceived to have a strong social responsibility image often have an increased ability to attract better job applicants, retain them once hired, and maintain employee morale. Similarly, Maignan et al. (1999) posited that ﬁrms that engage in CSR activities are likely to enjoy enhanced levels of employee commitment for two main reasons: (1) they are dedicated to ensuring the quality of work- place experiences, and (2) they address social issues – such as the protection of the environment or the welfare of the community – that are of concern to society in general and therefore also to employees. The above discussion is in line with the extensive research on employees’ justice perceptions, which posits that employees’ perceptions of their ﬁrms’ CSR activities shape their perceptions of the ﬁrm (Rupp et al., 2006). Furthermore, ﬁrms that engage in CSR tend to extend their CSR efforts internally to their and socially responsible practices (Rupp et al., 2006). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that ﬁrms that engage in CSR activities will foster a positive relationship with their employees, and as a result they are more likely to earn employees’ commitment than ﬁrms that do not engage in CSR initiatives (Aguilera et al., 2007). In addition, contrary to the presumed link between CSR activities and drivers of ﬁnancial performance, CSR activities are easily observed by employees and as a result may make an instant favourable impression on them that could boost their morale and their commitment to the ﬁrm. Given that a number of ﬁrms in emerging economies take advantage of a weak institutional environment to develop exploit- ative working conditions where workers are poorly paid and work excessive hours in hazardous working conditions (Budhwar and Mellahi, 2007), CSR activities beneﬁting employees make a signiﬁcant difference and are highly appreciated by employees. Taking the above arguments as a whole, we advance the following hypothesis: through fair employees A Study of Management Perceptions of the Impact of CSR 377 H2: CSR is positively related to employee com- mitment in emerging economies. CSR and corporate reputation Existing research provides evidence to suggest that corporate reputation is a pivotal intangible resource that contributes to a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Deephouse, 2000; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Shamsie, 2003), ‘‘precisely because the development of a good reputation takes considerable time and depends on a ﬁrm making stable and consistent investments over time’’ (Roberts and Dowling, 2002, p. 1091). Cor- porate reputation is enhanced or destroyed by ﬁrms’ decisions to engage or disengage in CSR activities. Bhattacharya and Sen (2003) pointed out that CSR ‘‘builds a reservoir of goodwill that ﬁrms can draw upon in times of crisis’’. Similarly, McWilliams and Siegel (2001, p. 120) reported that CSR ‘‘creates a reputation that a ﬁrm is reliable and honest’’. is not stakeholders, The link between CSR and corporate reputation in emerging economies straightforward. Contrary to employee commitment where employ- ees are able to observe their ﬁrms’ CSR activities, the impact of CSR on corporate reputation, in the eyes of different but mostly external is shaped by how the ﬁrm communicates its CSR activities and how its activities are reported in the national media and other communication mediums. Branco and Rodrigues (2006) noted that when ﬁrms are able to demonstrate, by communicating effec- tively with a wide range of stakeholders, that they operate in accordance with social and ethical criteria, they can build a positive reputation, whereas failing to do so can be a source of risk to their reputation. As discussed earlier, the two pre-conditions for CSR to have an impact on corporate reputation – ability to communicate the strategy to key stake- holders and media interest in the topic – are not always available to ﬁrms operating in emerging economies. The lack of in communicating internal activities such as CSR ini- tiatives to outsiders in emerging economies impedes ﬁrms’ ability to inform their stakeholders about their CSR activities. This the ﬁrm’s ability to inﬂuence stakeholder perceptions in order to boost skills and traditions limits its corporate reputation. Further, CSR is not yet an established topic in emerging economies; therefore, the media may not give ﬁrms engaged in CSR ini- tiatives the required space to help them generate public goodwill that could ultimately translate into an attractive corporate reputation. We propose that because of the lack of visibility of CSR activities in emerging economies, CSR will not have an impact on corporate reputation. We thereby advance the following hypothesis: H3: CSR is not positively related to corporate reputation in emerging economies. Data collection Data on CSR practices in the UAE were collected through a survey of organisations based in Dubai. The survey was designed in English, because English is the language of business communication in Dubai. We collected all the data via the survey because, unfortunately, reliable objective data of any kind is hard to come by in the UAE, and given the poor reliability of most ofﬁcial data, we believe the best data that can be collected and used is perception data. Following Huber and Power’s (1985) guidelines for obtaining quality data from key informants, we developed a survey using Dillman’s (1978) method and administered it to company executives drawn from the membership of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) database. In addi- tion, we performed a pilot study with business executives to assess the quality of the research design. These steps resulted in some minor stylistic changes being made, mainly to the instructions to respondents and the need to keep the responses anonymous. The sampling frame consisted of a total of 2,200 companies, with 310 responding, for an effective response rate of 14%. A total of 280 companies remained in the sample after companies missing either CSR or organisational performance data were eliminated, giving a ﬁnal response rate of 13%. Each of the 2,200 questionnaires was e-mailed and/or faxed to the identiﬁed contact person along with a cover letter explaining the nature of the study and the promise of conﬁdentiality. After the original mail-out, two follow-up mailings were sent that included duplicate and cover letters, questionnaires 378 Belaid Rettab et al.

We used Armstrong and Overton’s (1977) extrapolation procedure to assess non-response bias. No signiﬁcant differences were found between the early and late respondents. Thus, non-response bias is unlikely to be an inhibitor in our analysis. As shown in Table II, the ﬁnal sample included 61 ﬁrms from manufacturing, 51 from trading and repairing services, 64 from hotels and restaurants, 55 from real estate, rental, and business services, 14 from education, seven from banking and ﬁnancial services, two from mining, and two ﬁrms not able to classify their sector of activity. The executives who responded had been with their ﬁrms for an average of 11 years; they represented ﬁrms that had existed for an average of 18 years and employed an average of 276 people (see Table II). Variables Dependent variables four items, adopted from Samiee and Roth (1992), assessed return on investment, return on assets, sales growth, and proﬁt growth compared with compet- itors. Cronbach’s a for ﬁnancial performance is 0.85. Employee commitment was measured using a three-item questionnaire on a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. The items were derived from Jaworski and Kohli (1993) and include the following items: ‘‘our employees often go above and beyond their regular responsibilities to ensure the organisation’s well being’’; ‘‘the bonds between this organisation and its employees are very strong’’; and ‘‘our people are very committed to this organisation’’. Cronbach’s a for employee commitment is 0.84. Corporate reputation was measured using three items on a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. The items were adopted from a scale devel- oped by Fombrun et al. (2000) and measure mana- gerial perception of stakeholders’ perception of the reputation, trustworthiness, and quality of its offer- ings. Cronbach’s a for corporate reputation is 0.70. Financial performance was measured by seven items on a 5-point Likert scale, with 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree. The ﬁrst two items were adopted from Deshpande et al. (1993) and measured the ﬁrm’s relative market share and size compared with competitors, the third item was adopted from Jaworski and Kohli (1993) and measured the ﬁrm’s performance relative to competitors, and the last Independent variable Table III lists the items we used to measure CSR.

Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which each item reﬂected their organisation (on a 5-point Likert scale, from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). The scale reliabilities (Cronbach’s a) were consistent with those obtained by Maignan and Ferrell (2004): (4-item scale, Cron- community responsibilities bach’s a = 0.87), responsibilities (4-item scale, a = 0.83), employee responsibilities (5-item scale, a = 0.78), investor responsibilities (4- item scale, a = 0.78), customer responsibilities (4- item scale, a = 0.85), and supplier responsibilities (5-item scale, a = 0.78). Control variables We controlled for three variables that are reported to signiﬁcantly impact the effects of CSR on organi- sational performance. First, past research provides evidence that the size of the ﬁrm has an impact on the association between CSR and organisational performance (Moore, 2001; Preston, 1978; Stanwick and Stanwick, 1998). This is because stakeholders expect more social initiatives from large corporations than small ones. For example, large multinationals and publicly traded companies are more pressured to display their commitment to CSR as a result of consumer and shareholder activism against large multinationals (Drawbaugh, 2001; Klein, 1999). In addition, small ﬁrms are less able than their large counterparts to communicate their CSR activities to external stakeholders. Thus, we controlled for the size of the ﬁrm and measured size by the number of employees. Second, the type of CSR activities ﬁrms engage in depends on their sector of activities (McGuire et al., 2003; Waddock and Graves, 1997). For instance, ﬁrms in the oil sector are involved more in envi- ronmental issues, while ﬁrms in the food industry are involved more in health and safety and com- munity-related CSR activities. Further, Kolk (2003) reported that industries differ in their propensity to engage in CSR initiatives. Thus, we controlled for sector of activity. Firms were grouped into ﬁve sectors, namely tourism, manufacturing, real estate, trading, and banking and ﬁnance sectors. Third, consistent with past research (Delaney and Huselid, 1996) we controlled for the age of the ﬁrm. We measured age by the number of years since estab- lishment in Dubai. Reliability and validity of measurement scales Although we employed widely used measures, we subjected the constructs used in this study to stan- dard testing steps to make sure our constructs were reliable and valid (see Ping, 2004 and Slater et al., 2006). Following the steps used by Slater et al. (2006, p. 1226), we analysed the psychometric properties of the constructs used in this study in conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) using LISREL 8.80. Additionally, we evaluated the ﬁt of the measurement model. Again, following Slater et al. (2006), we examined the high-order structure of CSR to provide empirical support for the focus on CSR construct at the higher-order aggregate level. Construct reliability, convergent and discriminant validity We assessed the construct reliability by calculating a composite reliability (CR) for each construct. We used the procedures suggested by Fornell and Larcker (1981) to calculate the CR index (CRI).2 Along with reliability calculations, we also examined the parameter estimates and their associated t-values and assessed the average variance (AVE)3 of each construct (Anderson, 1982; Bagozzi and Lynn, 1982). AVE was used to gauge convergent validity (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Ping, 2004). Fornell and Larcker (1981) and Ping (2004) suggested conver- gent measures should contain less than 50% error variance (i.e. AVE should be 0.5 or above). We used the cut-off value of 0.70 and 0.50 for CR and AVE, respectively (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988; Hair et al., 1998). The scales’ reliabilities ranged from 0.78 to 0.88, the factor loadings ranged from 0.40 to 0.92 (p < 0.01), and AVE ranged from 0.50 to 0.89 (see Table IV). Following the reliability analysis, we established discriminant validity by calculating the shared variance4 between each pair of constructs and veri- fying that it was lower than the average variance extracted from the individual constructs (Bagozzi and 382 Belaid Rettab et al.

Shared variances are included in the upper triangle matrix. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01. N = 280. Lynn, 1982). As shown in Table IV, the shared vari- ances between pairs of all possible scale combinations indicated that the average variances extracted were higher than the associated shared variance in all cases. In other words, they are more internally correlated than they are with other constructs. This suggests discriminant validity of the construct in this study. Fit of the measurement model 1990), goodness-of-ﬁt The model ﬁt was evaluated using a series of indices recommended by Hu and Bentler (1999) – the (CFI) DELTA2 (Bollen, 1989), comparative ﬁt (Bentler, (GFI), Tucker-Lewis (TLI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) indices. A ﬁt to the data was achieved for the ﬁrst-order based CFA, with DELTA2 = 0.92, CFI = 0.95, NFI = 0.91, GFI = 0.90, TLI = 0.94, PNFI = 0.68, RFI = 0.89, and RMSEA = 0.08 (v2 = 657.7, d.f. = 241) (see Table V). index High-order construct for CSR We also examined the higher-order structure of CSR to provide empirical support, in addition to the the- oretical rationale, for the focus on CSR constructs at the higher-order aggregate level. The results indicate employee responsibility that, in addition to the item loadings reported in Table IV for each of the six CSR practices, there is support for each construct’s higher-order structure. As such, community responsibility (loading = 0.45, t-value = 5.17, p < 0.01), consumer responsibility (loading = 0.56, t-value = 5.72, p < 0.01), supplier responsibility (loading = 0.69, t-value = 8.02, p < 0.01), (loading = 0.45, t-value = 5.17, p < 0.01), responsibility (loading = 0.45, t-value = 5.17, p < 0.01) and envi- ronmental responsibility (loading = 0.45, t-value = 5.17, p < 0.01) function as ﬁrst-order indicators of the higher-order construct of CSR (R2s range from 20% to 66%). The model ﬁt for the higher-order structure was 0.90 for DELTA2, 0.95 for CFI, 0.92 for NFI and GFI, 0.93 for TLI, 0.68 for PNFI, 0.68 for RFI indices, and 0.08 for RMSEA (v2 = 341.37, d.f. = 71). investor is Following Ping (2004), construct validity of the second-order construct suggested by plausible correlations of the second-order construct with the other study variables, while convergent validity could be suggested by an AVE for the second-order construct that is greater than 0.5. The second-order CSR scale reliability was 0.79, the factor loadings ranged from 0.59 to 0.86 (p < 0.01), and the average variance was 50%. Overall, the nine measures in the ﬁrst-order construct as well as the second-order construct were found to be reliable and valid in the context of this study. A Study of Management Perceptions of the Impact of CSR 383 TABLE V Summary statistics of CFA Construct Average variance extracted (AVE) Composite reliability (CR) Range of loadings 65% 53% 59% 53% 52% 54% 50% 81% 89% 0.88 0.79 0.85 0.78 0.79 0.82 0.87 0.80 0.87 0.79–0.82 0.49–0.81 0.71–0.82 0.50–0.83 0.66–0.74 0.63–0.83 0.40–0.92 0.59–0.83 0.74–0.88 First-order construct Community responsibility Supplier responsibility Consumer responsibility Employee responsibility Investor responsibility Environmental responsibility Financial performance Corporate reputation Employee commitment v2 = 657.7 d.f. = 241 DELTA2 = 0.92 RFI = 0.89 PNFI = 0.68 CFI = 0.95 NFI = 0.91 GFI = 0.90 TLI = 0.94 RMSEA = 0.08 Deﬁnitions of key variables, descriptive statistics, and correlations TABLE VI Variables Deﬁnition Means (SD) 1 2 3 4 5 6 1.

Overall, the correlations are consistent with prior research in western developed countries, indicating a positive association between CSR and perfor- mance. 384 Belaid Rettab et al. Multiple regression was used to assess the impact of CSR on ﬁnancial performance, employee com- mitment, and corporate reputation. As noted above, we controlled for three control variables: ﬁrm age, size, and sector of activity. Preliminary analyses were performed to ensure no violation of the key assumptions of normality, linearity, multicollinearity, and homoscedasticity. Table VII reports results of the regression analysis of the different organisational performance measures. We ran two regressions for each performance mea- sure; one with the control variables (Model 1), and one without (Model 2). Inspection of Table VII shows that all performance measures are signiﬁcantly associated with CSR. Contrary to our expectation, we did not ﬁnd support for our ﬁrst hypothesis; the results show that CSR activities have a signiﬁ- cant positive impact on ﬁnancial performance (R2 = 0.112, p < 0.01). It is worth pointing out here that although the model is statistically signiﬁ- cant, the R2 is very small. The positive and statistically signiﬁcant association between employees’ commitment and CSR initia- tives supports our second hypothesis (R2 = 0.254, p < 0.01). However, contrary to our expectations (Hypothesis 3), the results show that CSR activities have a positive and statistically signiﬁcant impact on a ﬁrm’s reputation (R2 = 0.203, p < 0.01). Overall, we ﬁnd a and positive association signiﬁcant between CSR activities and all measures of perfor- mance used in this study. Discussion and conclusion In this study we explored the association between CSR and organisational performance in emerging economies, focusing speciﬁcally on the fast devel- oping region of Dubai. By so doing, we sought to extend the current body of research on the associa- tion between CSR and organisational performance in emerging economies. Our results are fairly straightforward: CSR has a signiﬁcant and positive association with all performance indicators used in this study. The most important ﬁnding in our study, and contrary to our prediction, is the positive association between CSR and ﬁnancial performance. This result is consistent with previous empirical studies con- ducted in western developed economies showing a positive relationship between CSR efforts and ﬁnancial performance. Conﬁrming the relationship between CSR and ﬁnancial performance in an emerging economy is signiﬁcantly important for a number of reasons. While scholars and practitioners in western developed economies have a wealth of evidence on the relationship between CSR and ﬁnancial performance, to the best of our knowledge, Results of regression analyses of different performance measures TABLE VII CSR and ﬁnancial performance CSR and employee commitment CSR and corporate reputation Model 1 Model 2 Model 1 Model 2 Model 1 Model 2 Constant CSR Sector Age Size R2 F-test b 1.972 0.301** – – – 0.090 4.740** 0.301 1.905 0.321** -0.045 -0.050 0.123 0.112 4.483** 0.316 2.161 0.438** – – – 0.192 7.557** 0.438 2.425 0.482** -0.112 -0.090* 0.070 0.254 7.932** 0.493 2.668 0.415** – – – 0.172 6.916** 0.415 2.866 0.434** -0.084 -0.057 0.018 0.203 6.795** 0.447 *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01.

In fast developing regions in emerging economies, where most of the emphasis is on economic growth and competitiveness, CSR is given low priority. Although it is likely that some ﬁrms may engage in CSR activities largely on moral grounds, providing evidence of a positive link between CSR and ﬁnancial performance may help ﬁrms enact CSR initiatives. results Furthermore, our raise serious doubts about the validity of the assertion that, as a result of the absence of strong institutional support for CSR, and presence of weak and ineffectual laws to guard against unethical practices, ﬁrms in emerging econ- omies do not capture rents from their CSR activities (Foo, 2007). This viewpoint posits that competi- tiveness in emerging economies is based on slash and burn, exploitative human resource practices. Con- sequently, CSR has no place in these countries. For example, Foo (2007) argues that the dominant par- adigm in emerging economies is the saying that ‘‘they (competitors) are ethical, so we have the competitive edge!’’ This is because, he argues, in emerging economies, ﬁrms engaged in CSR activi- ties ‘‘will have to suffer unnecessary cost burden and ‘competitive disadvantage’ against their unethical or irresponsible counterparts’’. Further, Foo (2007) argues that ﬁrms offering ‘‘greener products cannot compete with their less ethical counterparts who offer cheap but environmentally unfriendly prod- ucts’’. Unfortunately, prior to this study, there was little empirical evidence to refute the argument that CSR activities drain resources away and compro- mise ﬁrms’ competitiveness, and to support the assertion of a positive association between CSR and ﬁnancial success in emerging economies. Thus, our ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst empirical evidence to challenge the assertion that unethical ﬁrms crowd out ethical ones in emerging economies. As expected, the results show that CSR initiatives have a positive association with employee commit- ment. This is understandable because ﬁrms that are engaged in CSR activities generally tend to have fairer HR practices, and are highly regarded by their employees (Aguilera et al., 2007). This is because, in a country where more than 90% of employees are expatriates and a large number of them are on short- term contracts working in an institutional environment in which no safety net or alternative economic or social provision exists for employees, and where the interests of employees are not well represented (Budhwar are vulnerable, and their welfare depends almost entirely on good will vouchsafed them by their employers. and Mellahi, 2007), employees Another unexpected result of this study is the positive relationship between CSR and corporate reputation. We reasoned that ﬁrms in emerging economies would not be able to beneﬁt from their CSR initiatives in terms of corporate reputation because of the lack of skills and effective channels to communicate CSR activities to external stakehold- ers. We conjecture that perhaps because of the small size of Dubai, ﬁrms are able to make their CSR initiatives visible. Another plausible explanation for the positive impact of CSR on corporate reputation is the fact that CSR is currently being heavily pro- moted by a number of institutional bodies such as the Dubai Chamber of Commerce, which has a dedicated CSR and ethics centre (Centre for Responsible Business), which enables ﬁrms engaged in CSR activities to celebrate their success and boost their corporate image and competitiveness. This study has a number of implications for theory and practice. It bolsters and reinforces the accumu- lating body of empirical support for the positive impact of CSR on organisational performance. Although our results are by no means novel within the broad CSR–organisational performance litera- ture, they extend the current body of knowledge beyond western developed economies. Further, this study shows that the impact of CSR on organisa- tional performance in emerging economies is similar to that in western developed economies. At the centre of our argument for potential differences between developed and emerging economies is the fact that emerging economies have different business systems that may moderate the impact of CSR ini- tiatives on organisational performance. Therefore, on the basis of these results, scholars should perhaps put less emphasis on the institutional differences between developed and emerging economies when it comes to CSR activities. Although the focus on a fast developing region in an emerging economy is a contribution of this study, it might limit the gener- alisability of our ﬁndings to other emerging econo- mies. There are large differences in institutional conditions between Dubai and other emerging 386 Belaid Rettab et al. economies. As far as CSR is concerned, the lack of regulations, combined with intense competition and cut-throat practices in Dubai, may lead some ﬁrms to act in socially irresponsible ways to achieve their short-term economic objectives. However, since the government is able to monitor ﬁrms’ activities because of the small size of the emirate, ﬁrms need to sustain a high standard of honesty and integrity to be able to operate successfully in the market. Also, given the high per capita income in Dubai, ﬁrms tend to make higher proﬁts and therefore have high ﬁnancial slack, enabling them to give to charities, engage in community activities, and promote other CSR activities. For practitioners, this study provides empirical evidence to support CSR initiatives in emerging economies. Our experience with CSR managers in Dubai suggests that CSR champions are often dis- mayed at being unable to prove the worth of CSR activities. The positive impact of CSR on organi- sational performance reported in this study should help address concerns often expressed by sceptics about the value generated by CSR activities. The results of this study should also be of value to senior managers concerned with the overall performance of the ﬁrm. The positive impact CSR initiatives have on organisational performance underscores the importance of CSR in the quest for sustainable competitive advantage in both developed and emerging economies. Firms are able to reap tangible beneﬁts, such as higher ﬁnancial performance, higher employee commitment, and better reputation by engaging in CSR activities. Therefore, on the basis of this study, it is not advisable to marginalise CSR activities in emerging economies. A number of limitations suggest that our results should be viewed cautiously. Our study is based on perceptual data, and although perceptual measures of organisational performance are well established and widely accepted, we would welcome studies based on objective data, particularly regarding ﬁnancial measures of performance. In addition, because we collected data on the dependent and independent variables through the same self-report survey, our data may suffer from measurement bias.5 Further, this study provides evidence of the types of links between CSR initiatives and different types of performance but does not help us understand the process through which CSR impacts performance. We would welcome detailed case study research to shed light on the afore-mentioned process. Finally, this study is based on data from a single country, and caution must be taken when generalising the results of this study to other emerging economies. Notes 1 The factors are based on extensive discussions with practitioners in Dubai through stakeholder workshops and discussion forums organised by Dubai Chamber of Commerce and attended by the authors. 2 The formula for CR speciﬁes: CRg ¼ P ð P ð kci Þ2 kci P Þ2þ ð Þ ei scale g; where CRg = composite reliability for kci = standardised loading for scale item ci, and ei = measurement error for scale item ci. 3 The formula for AVE speciﬁes that: P P Vg ¼ P 2 kci 2 þ kci ei where Vg = average variance extracted for g; kci = standardised loading for scale item ci, and ei = measurement error for scale item ci. 4 Shared variance was calculated as c2 ¼ 1   w where c2 = shared variance between constructs, and with the diagonal element of w indicating the amount of unexplained variance. Because g and e were standardised, c2 was equal to the squared cor- relation between the two constructs. 5 We thank one of the reviewers for bringing this point to our attention.
