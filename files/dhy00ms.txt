Analyzing the global environmental standards of a sample of U.S.-based MNEs in relation to their stock market performance, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms adopting a single stringent global environmental standard have much higher market values, as measured by Tobin’s q, than ﬁrms defaulting to less stringent, or poorly enforced host country standards. Thus, developing countries that use lax environmental regulations to attract foreign direct investment may end up attracting poorer quality, and perhaps less competitive, ﬁrms. Our results also suggest that externalities are incorporated to a signiﬁcant extent in ﬁrm valuation. We discuss plausible reasons for this observation. (Direct Investment in Developing Countries; Firm Value; Firm-Level Environmental Policy) 1. Introduction Global companies have become major players on the world stage. There are now in excess of 40,000 multi- national enterprises (MNEs) with some 250,000 for- eign afﬁliates, investing more than $200 billion abroad each year (UNCTAD 1995). About 40% of world trade consists of intraﬁrm transfers of materials and compo- nents within MNEs (Greider 1997). The 10 largest MNEs have annual sales in excess of the gross national products of the 100 smallest countries in the world (Hawken 1993, p. 92). Foreign direct investment (FDI) now exceeds ofﬁcial development assistance by a factor of ﬁve, whereas ﬁve years ago it was less than half (Wolfensohn 1997). MNEs create, leverage, and arbitrage capabilities on a world scale. They are known to make positive contributions in economic efﬁciency (see, e.g., Caves 1996, Ch. 7) and serve as a conduit for the globaliza- tion of economies. However, MNEs have also proven elusive of public policy controls because of their economic power and ability to shift resources and production across borders. Questions have been raised concerning MNEs’ social and environmental performance (e.g., in regard to their pollution record and labor practices, etc.) Social critics have argued that MNEs, in seeking to reduce costs, play employees and countries against one another, creating downward pressure on wages and social standards on a world- wide basis (Gladwin et al. 1995, Greider 1997). Our focus is on the environmental aspect. Led by MNEs, the afﬂuent societies of the developed world account for more than 75% of the world’s energy and 0025-1909/00/4608/1059$05.00 1526-5501 electronic ISSN Management Science © 2000 INFORMS Vol. 46, No. 8, August 2000 pp. 1059–1074 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:21 .

Environmentalists contend that MNEs are now engag- ing in ﬂight to “pollution havens” by moving dirty operations to countries where regulatory standards are less stringent (Daly 1994). Through ﬂight to pollu- tion havens, MNEs can avoid expensive pollution controls, cut costs by recapitalizing old equipment, and continue to make products that are no longer considered environmentally acceptable in the more highly regulated markets of the developed world (Vernon 1992). Over time, it is claimed that these practices lead to a “race to the bottom” as poor nations and localities vie for plants and facilities that seek only to minimize cost and externalize environmental re- sponsibility (Korten 1995). While some MNEs clearly utilize such practices, it is unclear whether there is systematic advantage in racing to the bottom. There appear to be forces that encourage MNEs to integrate and standardize their environmental practices globally. Indeed, it may make business sense in some cases to adopt global standards that exceed those required by some local laws or regulations, especially when environmental laws and regulations become more stringent as an economy grows. By investing in state-of-the-art technology and processes in developing countries, MNE facilities may be able to achieve simultaneously world-class cost, quality, and environmental performance. In addition, MNE’s may reap standardization beneﬁts and other intangible advantages like positive reputation effects. In this paper, we therefore seek an empirical answer to an intriguing and important question: Is ﬁrm value linked to an MNE’s corporate environmental policy? Speciﬁcally, we examine whether adopting a single stringent corporate environmental standard enhances ﬁrm value compared to those MNEs defaulting to less stringent or poorly enforced host country standards. We ﬁnd that ﬁrms adopting a stringent global envi- ronmental standard have higher market values, as measured by Tobin’s q (market value over replace- ment costs of tangible assets). Our results have strong implications: “Better ﬁrms” appear to adopt higher environmental standards and pollute less. However, we cannot identify with our data any causal (time series) relationships between either past changes in environmental standards and current change in ﬁrm value, or past change in ﬁrm value and current change in environmental standards. In the next section, we describe prior research linked to the current work that is helpful in interpret- ing our results. In the third section, we discuss theory and propose our research questions. We present our methodology in §4 and results in §5. Discussion of the results and conclusions are contained in §6 and 7, respectively. 2. Prior Research A growing body of literature ties superior environ- mental performance to ﬁnancial performance (e.g. Porter and van der Linde 1995, Hart 1995). For exam- ple, three recent studies link proactive environmental management to superior stock performance: Hamilton (1995), White (1995), and Klassen and McLaughlin (1996) all use event study methodology to demon- strate that (1) news of high levels of toxic emissions results in signiﬁcant negative abnormal returns; (2) ﬁrms with strong environmental management prac- tices have better stock price returns than ﬁrms with poor practices after a major environmental disaster, such as the Exxon Valdez accident; and (3) environ- mental performance awards result in signiﬁcant posi- tive abnormal returns. The ﬁrst and second results indicate that investors expect that ﬁrms incur non- trivial costs for environmental cleanup and that these costs are lower for ﬁrms with better environmental records. The third result suggests that recognition of environmental performance has a positive reputation effect which possibly augments ﬁrm value.1 Feldman et al. (1996) analyze a sample of 300 large public companies in the United States to see if invest- ments in environmental management lead to reduced risk, and if such risk reduction is valued by ﬁnancial markets. Their ﬁndings suggest that investments in environmental management lead to substantial reduc- tion in perceived risk of a ﬁrm, with an accompanying 1 The positive reputation effect may include not just investors’ impressions of a ﬁrm’s environmental performance; it may also include investors’ impressions of a ﬁrm’s management quality. 1060 Management Science/Vol. 46, No. 8, August 2000 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:21 .

Other scholars have examined the relationship be- tween environmental and proﬁt performance. Cohen et al. (1995), for example, demonstrate a strong corre- lation between environmental performance and ﬁrm proﬁtability. Similarly, Hart and Ahuja (1996) present evidence indicating that efforts to prevent pollution and reduce emissions are positively associated with the “bottom line” (as measured by return on sales and return on assets) within one to two years of initiation, and that those ﬁrms with the highest emission levels stand to gain the most. Russo and Fouts (1997), in their study of 243 ﬁrms, ﬁnd that environmental perfor- mance and return on assets (ROA) are positively linked, and that industry growth moderates this rela- tionship, with returns to environmental performance higher for high-growth industries. Finally, Nehrt (1996) examines the relationship between timing and intensity of investment in pollution prevention and growth in proﬁts within a sample of 50 pulp and paper companies. His results indicate a positive rela- tionship between early movers in pollution prevention and proﬁt growth. While results are generally convergent, most empir- ical work to date has been restricted to MNEs in the United States or Western Europe where data are more available regarding environmental performance (e.g., Kennelly 1996). There has been some conceptual and case study treatment of MNE environmental perfor- mance in foreign contexts and developing countries (e.g., Korten 1995, Hart 1997), but little empirical research on this dimension has been conducted. The limited empirical work that has been done suggests that MNEs are more environmentally responsible than their local competitors in developing countries (Eske- land and Harrison 1997), but the evidence regarding MNE social performance is mixed (e.g., Zahra et al. 1993, Johnson and Greening 1994). We were unable to ﬁnd any published empirical research focusing specif- ically on the question of how MNE international environmental standards, particularly their behavior in developing countries, affect ﬁrm market value. It is to that question that we now turn our attention. 3. Theory Arguments can be made on both sides of the question of whether a stringent global corporate environmental standard represents a competitive asset or liability for MNEs. Below, we articulate the major theoretical lenses on either side of the argument. Global Environmental Standards as Altruistic Liability Conventional economic logic suggests that, ceteris pa- ribus, in countries where environmental regulation is either lax or not enforced, it is cheaper to operate than in countries where strict environmental regulations result in ﬁnes, liabilities, and administrative or legal action against polluters (Stewart 1993). For example, the annual cost of complying with environmental regulation in the United States now exceeds $125 billion, or about 2.1% of GDP. In most developing countries, environmental spending represents only a fraction of 1% of GDP (Jaffe et al. 1995). Evidence also suggests that strict pollution control regulations in the United States may have an adverse impact on productivity (Gray and Shadbegian 1993), perhaps by forcing companies to commit resources and manpower to nonproductive uses such as envi- ronmental auditing, waste treatment, and litigation (Haveman and Christiansen 1981). Hence, when oper- ating in countries with less stringent or poorly en- forced environmental regulations, defaulting to local standards reduces costs. Furthermore, by defaulting to local standards in countries with lax regulation or enforcement, compa- nies may be able to recapitalize old equipment that is no longer acceptable in more regulated markets, thereby lowering costs even further. Companies can also market products in such countries that may be discouraged or even banned for environmental rea- sons in more regulated markets, thereby extending product life cycles and revenue streams (Vernon 1992, Korten 1995). In short, there may be considerable ﬁnancial penal- ties associated with overly general or constraining environmental policies in response to standardized criteria when it is not really needed or justiﬁed (Ron- dinelli and Vastag 1996). Overall, the presumption is that defaulting to local standards is cost-saving, and Management Science/Vol. 46, No. 8, August 2000 1061 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:21 .

Firms that are altruistic in their attempts to achieve higher environmental standards when invest- ing in low-standard countries are not serving their shareholders. The behavior hurts market value and may be a reﬂection of managerial idiosyncrasies. Global Environmental Standards as Value-Adding Asset A competing logic suggests that value-seeking inves- tors may view defaulting to lower or poorly enforced local environmental standards as counterproductive to long-term proﬁt performance. First, the cost savings associated with lower environmental standards may be exaggerated and may not even exist: MNEs often ﬁnd that they have to pay for the remediation of environmental damages even if they are in full com- pliance with local regulations and requirements, often due to pressures from environmental interest groups or international organizations (e.g., World Bank). Such cleanup costs can be signiﬁcant. Second, in making new investments, a ﬁrm may ﬁnd that moving downward from accustomed higher standards violates established corporate routines and is actually more costly than adhering to the higher standards, even in the absence of regulation. By spec- ifying a single corporate standard, performance mon- itoring and evaluation costs might be reduced because a single set of values, speciﬁcations, and procedures can be deployed throughout the world, without the need to consider local deviations from the norm. Global standardization will also mean that production improvements made in one location can readily be transferred to all subsidiaries. Global strategies lever- age the return on investment in improvements made in high environmental standard regions across all geographic locations (Prahalad and Doz 1987, Bartlett and Ghoshal 1989). Thus, adopting a single stringent environmental standard is consistent with pursuit of global competitive strategies by MNEs (Christmann 1998). Third, while adequate environmental standards may not yet exist in many developing countries, it can be argued that in the not-too-distant future, standards will rise as income increases and people become more sensitive toward and concerned about environmental deterioration. This pattern of environmental regula- tion following GDP growth has already been observed among newly industrialized nations such as Taiwan, Korea, and Singapore (Grossman and Krueger 1995). In other words, there may be an important future beneﬁt to adopting a single global standard if the productive life of capital extends beyond the period of lax or poorly enforced regulation. When the environmental standards in developing countries improve with increases in per capita income, ﬁrms performing above current requirements will not need additional investment, while ﬁrms defaulting to the current minimums will need to reinvest to con- form to the heightened requirements. A foresighted ﬁrm could take advantage of this by adopting higher environmental standards than are dictated by current regulations. MNEs are especially well-positioned in this regard: They can actually use the environment as a strategic competitive advantage by speeding up the process (e.g., by lobbying for tighter environmental regulations) and thus outcompete local ﬁrms with lesser ﬁnancial means, knowledge, and capability. Fourth, the presumption that polluting lowers pro- duction cost can be challenged. Putting aside the issue of regulatory stringency, there are other ways in which environmental standards may affect competi- tiveness. Speciﬁcally, not all environmental regula- tions affect ﬁrms’ behavior in the same manner, and the form of environmental regulation can be an im- portant determinant of business impact. For example, U.S. environmental regulations often mandate speciﬁc control or treatment technologies. These so-called “command and control” style regulations dictate that speciﬁc pollution control technologies be used, often at an exorbitant cost (Porter and van der Linde 1995). However, in many cases, it is possible to reduce or eliminate pollution by making changes in the manu- facturing or production process, rather than capturing pollutants for treatment or disposal at the “end-of-the- pipe.” Pollution and waste are reduced at the outset by a conscious effort to heighten resource efﬁciency. Many state-of-the-art technologies have high resource productivity. Such “eco-efﬁciency” can actually lower 1062 Management Science/Vol. 46, No. 8, August 2000 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:21 .

Finally, there may be fringe beneﬁts associated with adhering to higher environmental standards. By com- mitting to standards that exceed those of the host country, the company might beneﬁt from heightened employee morale and thus productivity (Romm 1993). Adopting an internal corporate environmental stan- dard ahead of legal requirements avoids special inter- est group pressures and may result in positive repu- tation effects for the ﬁrm, improving its public image relative to competitors. These considerations suggest that a ﬁrm defaulting to lower or poorly enforced local environmental stan- dards may be overlooking both tangible and intangi- ble beneﬁts associated with conforming to a higher global standard. Firms conforming to a higher global environmental standard may ﬁnd that the strategy enhances value. Value Creation or Destruction? The conﬂicting nature of the above arguments sug- gests that the relationship between corporate environ- mental standards and ﬁrm value is an empirical question. We therefore investigate two questions: 1. Are MNEs which exceed local environment standards (those adopting higher global standards) higher- or lower-value ﬁrms? Is adhering to higher global environmental standards associated with higher market value or does it represent a nonpro- ductive use of assets and a drag on market value? 2. Is there a detectable lead-lag relationship be- tween ﬁrm value and environmental standards? In other words, do changes in environmental standards cause changes in market value or visa versa? 4. Methods Sample The sample of ﬁrms for this study was drawn from the U.S. Standard and Poor’s 500 list of corporations. Although this population of ﬁrms is clearly biased towards the largest ﬁrms, this was not deemed to be a problem because MNEs were our target sample and the S&P 500 contains largely MNEs. Our sample period was from 1994 to 1997. This is the period in which we have data on both ﬁrm environmental standards and market value. Although the data source for our environmental standards, Investor Responsi- bility Research Center’s (IRRC) Corporate Environ- mental Proﬁle, collected data prior to 1994, the survey item that we draw upon changed in 1994, making comparison with prior years’ data inappropriate. Two screens were applied in selecting ﬁrms. First, only those MNEs involved in manufacturing or min- ing (SIC codes between 2000 and 3999) were selected because the main research variable, corporate environ- mental standards, was most salient to these ﬁrms. Second, only those MNEs with production operations in countries with GDP per capita below $8,000 (1985 dollars) were included in the study. Evidence suggests that concern for and activity in environmental regula- tion decreases dramatically for countries with per capita income levels below $8,000 (Grossman and Krueger 1995). Sampling on this dimension therefore allows us to insure that there is a difference between those ﬁrms that default to local standards and those that adopt a global standard. After applying these two screens to the population, we ended up with eighty- nine ﬁrms, which were drawn from ﬁfteen two-digit SIC codes. Dependent Variable The key dependent variable (Tobin’s q) is deﬁned as ﬁrm market value per dollar of replacement costs of tangible assets. Tobin’s q is widely used as an indica- tor of intangible value in economics research (e.g., Lindenberg and Ross 1981) and in the international business literature (e.g., Morck and Yeung 1991). We proxied for ﬁrm market value by summing Compustat- reported ﬁrm equity value (outstanding shares times share price), book value of long-term debt, and net current liabilities. We proxied for replacement costs of tangible assets by summing book value of inventory and net value of physical plant and equipment.2 2 A more elaborate estimate for Tobin’s q (e.g., Lindenberg and Ross 1981) and the current simpliﬁed estimate often yield qualitatively similar results. The key is whether the use of book—instead of market—value of debts, of inventory, and of plant and equipment introduces any systematic biases. Such biases are likely to be linked to industry and ﬁrm size. We incorporate industry effects in our statistical analyses in case there are any systematic biases linked to Management Science/Vol. 46, No. 8, August 2000 1063 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:21 .

This data set describes each corporation’s posture with regard to international environmental policy from 1994 to 1997. Each ﬁrm is allowed to check any of the following three categories “1,” “2,” or “3” in each year: (1) local—the corporation adheres to local stan- dards only; (2) U.S.—the corporation applies U.S. environmen- tal standards wherever it does business; and (3) stringent global—the corporation has its own internal environmental standard that exceeds any na- tional standard. We ﬁrst used this information to code a ﬁrm’s environmental standards in year t (ENV STD t) as “1,” “2,” and “3” accordingly. Next, we created two dummy variables. The ﬁrst, ED t, indicates that a ﬁrm’s environmental standard in year t was not “local” (i.e., the ﬁrm did not adopt “1” in the above scheme). The second dummy, ED2 t, indicates that a ﬁrm’s environmental standard in year t was “stringent global” (i.e., the ﬁrm adopted “3” in the above scheme). The implicit assumption is that ﬁrms declaring a lower category of environmental standard pollute more. This assumption requires validation. Full-scale validation is difﬁcult, however, because consistent and reliable pollution data on a global scale do not exist, especially in developing countries (the pre- sumed “pollution havens”). We therefore resorted to validating the assumption based on each ﬁrm’s U.S. “Toxic Release Inventory” (TRI) data. As expected, we found that ﬁrms adhering to “local standards” pol- luted the most, while ﬁrms applying “an internal global standard that exceeds any national standard” polluted the least. Firms applying U.S. standards overseas were in between these two extremes. The difference between the ﬁrst and the third group is most statistically signiﬁcant. Details on the validating effort are reported in the Appendix. industries. We control for ﬁrm size by using the logarithm of the ﬁrm’s assets in a given year. To avoid the missing variable problem, we needed to include controls known to affect Tobin’s q that are also plausibly related to a ﬁrm’s choice of environ- mental standards. Tobin’s q is known to be related to capital structure, intangibles like R&D and advertising expenditures, and multinationality (e.g., Morck and Yeung 1991). Hence, we included in our regression analyses the following control variables: R&D inten- sity (R&D/dollars of total assets), advertising inten- sity (ADV/dollars of total assets), leverage (long-term debt/dollars of total assets), and multinationality (per- cent of foreign assets/dollars of total assets).3 We also included ﬁrm size (deﬁned as the log of total dollars of assets) to control for the possibility that ﬁrm size is related with Tobin’s q. 4 All data were obtained from Compustat for the years 1994–1997, except multina- tionality, which was obtained from Worldscope. These control variables are possibly correlated with a ﬁrm’s choice of environmental standards. For exam- ple, large and more internationally oriented ﬁrms are likely to be highly conscious of their public image because of the large scale and scope of any negative ramiﬁcation from bad publicity. Highly leveraged ﬁrms may be less able to afford the investment re- quired to implement more stringent global environ- mental standards. 3 We also used the percentage of foreign sales as an alternative speciﬁcation of multinationality. The results were in all cases not signiﬁcantly different from those obtained using the percentage of foreign assets. 4 There are other variables that are known to affect Tobin’s q. First, there may be industry-level effects like competitive struc- ture and growth potential. We ﬁlter these out by using two-digit SIC industry dummies to capture ﬁxed industry effects. There are also other known ﬁrm-level effects that affect Tobin’s q. One of these is growth trends. However, one runs the risk of double counting the growth effect if investment in intangibles is already incorporated. Product diversiﬁcation can also affect Tobin’s q. Product diversiﬁcation is highly correlated with geographic diversiﬁcation. Excluding either does not, however, affect the behavior of the other, as the comparison between Morck and Yeung (1998, Table 2) and Morck and Yeung (1991, Tables 4 and 5) illustrates. To conserve degrees of freedom and to avoid collinearity, we do not include these extra explanatory variables. Following a referee’s suggestion, we include the log of size (total dollars of assets) as an independent variable. 1064 Management Science/Vol. 46, No. 8, August 2000 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:21 .

With regard to the ﬁrst question, we identiﬁed the statistical relationship be- tween ﬁrm value and level of corporate environmental standard using t-tests and multiple regression. We recognize that using the panel data entails counting ﬁrms with unchanged environmental standard multi- ple times, which exaggerates sample size and thus the t-statistics. We corrected for this by replacing the ﬁrm-year data with ﬁrm-average data when we con- ducted bivariate analyses (i.e., simple correlations). When we conducted multivariate regression analysis, we used the ﬁrm-average data to run “group mean” regressions. We also ran random ﬁrm effects regres- sions that utilize all available data points in our cross-sectional panel.5 To create the ﬁrm-average data, we averaged the dependent and independent variables for each year in which the ﬁrm reported a consistent environmental standard. Thus, a ﬁrm that used host country stan- dards in every year would have one observation in the averaged ﬁrm-year data, while a ﬁrm that changed from host to U.S. standards would have two observa- tions—one for each of the environmental standards. Out of our 89 ﬁrms, 72 never changed their environ- mental standards, 16 did so once and one did so twice.6 Out of the 18 total changes, 12 were “positive” (upgrading environmental standards) while 6 were “negative” (downgrading environmental standards). Hence, there are 107 (89 ⫹ 12 ⫹ 6) ﬁrm-average observations. There were 6 missing “environmental standards” data points in our sample period. Out of these 107 observations, 30 adopted “local environmen- tal standards,” 18 adopted “U.S. standards” and 59 adopted “stringent global standards.” 5 In conducting multivariate regression analyses on the relationship between Tobin’s q and environmental standards, we did not intro- duce ﬁrm ﬁxed effects because for a very large proportion of our sample ﬁrms the focal independent variable (environmental stan- dard) does not have much variation. 6 We are not able to tell whether the changes reported by the ﬁrm are real or due to reporting errors. As a conservative robustness check, we repeated our analyses excluding the ﬁrm. Our results remained intact. With regard to the second question, we used the Granger causality method which involves regressing, in turn, a) ﬁrm value on its own lags and past environmental standard; and b) environmental stan- dard on its own lags and past ﬁrm value. When we performed the causality tests, we used the full panel data, rather than the ﬁrm-average data. When past changes in environmental standards predict current changes in market value, but past changes in market value do not explain current changes in environmen- tal standards, we can conclude that adopting a higher environmental standard causes market value increase. When the reverse is true, we can conclude that higher ﬁrm value causes adoption of more stringent global environmental standards. 5. Results Table 1 presents means, standard deviations, and simple correlations for the variables based on ﬁrm- average data in our study. As expected, we ﬁnd a positive correlation between a ﬁrm’s Tobin’s q and its levels of research and development and advertising, and its multinationality. Likewise, a negative correla- tion is found between the Tobin’s q value and the leverage of the ﬁrm. We now turn to consideration of our two research questions. Are Stringent Environmental Standards and Market Value Compatible? The key result in Table 1 is that ﬁrms that do not adopt local environmental standards have higher market values. The dummy variable ED7 allows us to com- pare ﬁrms that do not adopt local environmental standards to those that do. ED2 allows us to compare ﬁrms that adopt a stringent global environmental standard to those that do not. Both ED and ED2 are positively and signiﬁcantly correlated with Tobin’s q. These observations provide preliminary evidence that those companies that go beyond local environmental standards have higher market values. Furthermore, companies adopting their own “internal environmen- tal standard” have the highest Tobin’s q values. To better understand the differences in the charac- 7 Because the data is ﬁrm-average, the time subscript for ED and ED2 is unnecessary.

The ﬁrst interesting observation in Table 2 is that defaulting to local environmental standards is by no means the most common practice (only 30 out of 107 ﬁt this description). Rather, the most common strategy in this sample is to adopt a stringent internal standard that is applied globally (59 out of 107 observations). The t-tests reveal that those companies which use U.S. standards worldwide have insigniﬁcantly higher Tobin’s q values than those companies which use the standards of the various host countries in which they operate. (The t statistic is at best marginally signiﬁcant at the 10% level, 1-tail.) However, the ﬁrms that employ their own internal standard around the world have signiﬁcantly higher Tobin’s q values than those that use U.S. standards. The remaining t-tests in Table 2 indicate that the ﬁrms that use host, U.S., or internal environmental standards have roughly equal levels of R&D and advertising. However, ﬁrms using host country environmental standards are most leveraged, 1066 Management Science/Vol. 46, No. 8, August 2000 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:21 .

Of course, the analyses presented thus far do not control for factors that may be driving the observed relationships (e.g., spending on intangibles, ﬁrm size, leverage, and multinationality, etc.). In particular, there could be industry effects present. For example, some industries (e.g., pharmaceuticals, where ﬁrms have generally high Tobin’s q values) utilize highly toxic chemicals and materials, making such ﬁrms more likely to adopt higher environmental standards. Therefore, we conduct multivariate analyses that con- trol for these effects.8 Table 3 reports piecewise regressions which com- pare ﬁrms adopting the different types of environ- mental standards using the ED and ED2 dummy variables described above. Here, the base case in the regressions is the Tobin’s q of ﬁrms adopting local standards. The regression coefﬁcient for ED reveals the difference in Tobin’s q between ﬁrms adopting U.S. standards worldwide and ﬁrms adopting local standards. The regression coefﬁcient for ED2 reveals the difference in Tobin’s q between ﬁrms adopting a stringent internal standard and ﬁrm adopting U.S. standards worldwide. The difference in Tobin’s q between ﬁrms adopting a stringent internal standard and ﬁrms adopting local standards is the sum of the regression coefﬁcients for ED and ED2.9 Regressions 3-a and 3-b are group mean regressions based on ﬁrm-average data that we used in Tables 1 and 2.

We checked the robustness of our results. We ﬁrst conducted residual diagnostics. We found no outli- ers whose deletion materially affects the results of our regression analyses. Heteroskedasticity is a con- cern with our data, especially in our group mean regressions in which we analyzed ﬁrm-average ob- servations, where the number of observations from which the ﬁrm-averages are derived is not ﬁxed. Accordingly, we conducted White’s (1980) speciﬁ- cation test, and determined that heteroskedasticity is not affecting our results. Finally, to be very conservative (but sacriﬁcing statistical efﬁciency), we repeated regressions 3-a and 3-b using year-by- year data, one year’s worth of data per run. We found qualitatively similar results. Based on the above statistical analyses, we conclude that there is a reliable positive and signiﬁcant relation- ship between the use of a single global environmental standard and a ﬁrm’s Tobin’s q. Do Higher Environmental Standards Cause Increases in Market Value? Our next step is to explore causality in this relation- ship using the original time series panel data. Does upgrading the ﬁrm’s environmental standards lead to higher ﬁrm value (higher Tobin’s q)? Or, is it the case that increases in a ﬁrm’s Tobin’s q result in higher environmental standards? To address this question, we ﬁrst regress Tobin’s q on the ﬁve control variables used in earlier regres- sion runs. We then do the same for our environmen- tal standards variable (ENV STD t) as deﬁned in §4. We use this variable because it has more variation than either ED or ED2. The residuals from these regression runs comprise the portion of To- bin’s q and environmental standards respectively not explained by R&D, advertising, leverage, total assets, and multinationality. We then regress To- bin’s q residuals for a given ﬁrm on the lagged values of the Tobin’s q residual and the lagged values of the environmental standards’ residual. We do not know what time length, if any, will be appropriate for the lagged effect to be noticeable, so we present one, two, and three-year lags. These results are reported in Table 4a, columns 4a-1 to 4a-3. We repeat the analysis replacing ENV STD t by ED2 t. These results are reported in columns 4a-4 to 4a-6. 10 All speciﬁcations reveal consistent results. The results in Table 4a indicate that the previous years’ environmental standards are not signiﬁcant predictors of current Tobin’s q values.11 We tried several alternative speciﬁcations for assessing whether a change in environmental standards led to a change in Tobin’s q in future years. All results consistently showed that there is no lagged reaction to environ- mental standards on the part of the market. One interpretation is that our sample data have too few changes in environmental standards (only 17 ﬁrms out of 89 ﬁrms did so) to be able to generate statistically reliable results. Another plausible speculation is that the stock market upgrades a ﬁrm’s market value within an annual time window once the ﬁrm adopts a higher environmental standard.12 Using the same analytical approach, we also looked to see whether ﬁrms that had changes in market valuations altered their environmental standards in subsequent years, but there was no evidence that such a link existed (see Table 4b). In summary, we have found a signiﬁcant and positive relationship between the market value of a company (as measured by Tobin’s q) and the level of environmental standard it uses. This effect remains even after we have controlled for industry effects as well as other factors known to affect Tobin’s q. Furthermore, our results suggest that a ﬁrm’s mar- 10 Regressions 4a-4 to 4a-6 were suggested by a referee. 11 We recognize that the “unit root” problem may be present in our results in Table 5a and 5b, because in each case, the coefﬁcient on the one-year lagged values of the dependent variable are not signiﬁ- cantly different from 1.0. We attempted a ﬁrst-difference analysis in order to correct for this potential problem, but this leaves us with only 42 observations in one year and may thus have the usual small sample difﬁculties. The results of the ﬁrst-difference analysis do not contradict our reported ﬁndings. 12 As long as ﬁrm valuation is based on expectations, our result is not inconsistent with results obtained by, e.g., Hart and Ahuja (1996) which show that efforts to prevent pollution and reduce emissions leads to an increase in return on sales and assets after one or two years. 1068 Management Science/Vol. 46, No. 8, August 2000 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:21 .

However, past changes in market value do not predict whether a ﬁrm will adopt higher environmental standards in the future. 6. Discussion Our ﬁnding that adopting stringent global environ- mental standards is positively associated with a higher ﬁrm value is open to several possible interpre- tations. First, it may be that private valuations inter- nalize environmental externalities: The less negative externalities a ﬁrm imposes, the higher the ﬁrm value. Second, it is possible that adopting stringent environ- mental standards is actually more proﬁtable than defaulting to lower or poorly enforced local environ- mental standards. Finally, poorly managed and less competitive ﬁrms may tend to adopt lower environ- mental standards. In this section, we discuss each of these interpretations. Internalization of Externalities The ﬁrst interpretation is based not only on our data, but also on the results of other studies (e.g., Hamilton 1995, White 1995, Klassen and McLaughlin 1996). All these results suggest that investors incorporate poten- tial environmental problems and liabilities into their pricing of companies. In developed economies with strong regulatory regimes, the mechanism exists to support this observation: The institutional and legal systems support the public’s rights to a clean environ- ment so that polluters have to pay for their environ- mental damage. Hence, ﬁrms that have higher poten- tial environmental liabilities realize lower market values. The focus of this study (developing countries), however, involves locations where environmental regulations are lax or property rights to a clean environment are poorly enforced. In these contexts, other mechanisms must be at work. One possible mechanism for the internalization of externalities under these circumstances is as follows: Interest Management Science/Vol. 46, No. 8, August 2000 1069 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:21 .

Through these means poor environmental performance is translated into bad public image, lower consumer goodwill, and ultimately, lower ﬁrm value. 13 Aware of this disci- 13 For example, The Economist (July 20, 1996; “The fun of being a multinational”) reported that: In Malaysia, a $5.5 billion hydroelectric dam to be built by a consortium including ABB Asea´ Brown Boveri, a Swiss- based multinational, is being attacked by local people and western environmental groups for destroying rainforest. The average oil baron or mining boss might once have shrugged off such events as little local difﬁculties. Some even relished a brawl. Nowadays, they recognise that the stakes are higher. It is not only the prospect of consumer boycotts that worries them. In addition, staff morale can suffer (many Shell em- ployees opposed the sinking of the Brent Spar), political contacts can be upset (Nelson Mandela denounced Shell’s behaviour in Nigeria) and worst of all sanctions can be plinary effect, far-sighted managers conscious of ﬁrm value opt to maintain a high level of environ- mental practice, even where regulations do not require it. Bottom-line Beneﬁts There appear to be economic implications of adopting high environmental standards that extend beyond the negative or “disciplinary” effects associated with poor environmental performance discussed above. In fact, the smallest coefﬁcient for ED2 (Table 3, regression 3-d) indicates that ﬁrms adopting their own stringent global environmental standards have a Tobin’s q that is approximately 1.002 higher than those using U.S. standards abroad. Given the mean value of ﬁrm tangible assets in our sample, 1.002 represents more than $8.6 billion per ﬁrm. If we use the average of the regression coefﬁcients for ED2 in Table 4, the number increases to $10.4 billion per ﬁrm. Even company imposed (the state of Massachusetts recently banned con- tracts with ﬁrms doing business in Myanmar). 1070 Management Science/Vol. 46, No. 8, August 2000 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:21 .

The magnitude of the value increase associated with higher environmental standards thus represents more than just the monetarization of neg- ative externalities. We therefore advance our second interpretation: Adopting stringent environmental standards is more proﬁtable than defaulting to lower or poorly enforced local environmental standards. This interpretation is consistent with other studies (e.g., Cohen et al. 1995, Hart and Ahuja 1996, Russo and Fouts 1997), all of which suggest a higher level of proﬁtability associated with better environmental practices and efforts to reduce emissions and waste. We need to be careful, however, in explaining how stringent environmental standards might raise proﬁt performance. Two possible mechanisms apply. First, it may be that adopting the latest technologies and equipment increases productivity, and that is what makes the investment worthwhile. Better environ- mental practices are embedded in the latest technolo- gies as a result of pressures from interest groups and governments in developed countries. From this per- spective, the contribution of high environmental stan- dards to bottom-line performance is “coincidental”: The effect would not be present were it not for societal pressures to develop more environmentally friendly technologies and equipment. One would expect early movers to see the biggest gains from such invest- ments, as Nehrt (1996) reports. Over time, companies not able to keep up with the investments would evidence erosion in bottom-line performance and ﬁrm value.14 A second, internally driven mechanism may also be at work, however. Firms that adopt high environmen- tal standards are those that strive for eco-efﬁcient production systems. The conscious policy to pursue technologies and processes that increase the resource 14 However, this is not a typical “equilibrium” perspective. At equilibrium, the value of the above investment should reﬂect the value of cash ﬂow and thus should not affect Tobin’s q. productivity of their operations has a positive result for the bottom line.15 Low Performers Race to the Bottom Tobin’s q can be interpreted as a measure of ﬁrm “quality” (e.g., better-managed ﬁrms are higher-value ﬁrms). One can therefore interpret our results as suggesting that “quality” ﬁrms adopt high environ- mental standards independent of local requirements, and generate less pollution, while lower-quality ﬁrms engage in a “race to the bottom,” as a means of gaining short term ﬁnancial advantage. High “quality” ﬁrms are typically more focused on corporate goals and competitive position. The application of a stringent global environmental standard may be indicative of a desire to build organizational awareness amongst all afﬁliates, of company policies and practices. It may also be an indicator that a company, as an industry leader, aims to stay on top in all aspects of its business. There are still other possible explanations for the linkage between ﬁrm quality and ﬁrm environmental standard. For example, it is possible that better ﬁrms have the foresight to plan for the future: They see the importance of applying high environmental standards even where not required because the standards will increase as a region grows and develops. It is also possible that higher-quality ﬁrms simply have the resources to invest in higher environment standards. They use environmental performance as a competitive weapon against other ﬁrms with fewer resources or means to keep up. 7. Conclusion This paper refutes the idea that adoption of global environmental standards by MNEs constitutes a lia- bility that depresses market value. On the contrary, the evidence from our analysis indicates that positive market valuation is associated with the adoption of a 15 An extension of our argument is that developing countries offer particularly attractive locations to experiment with such “clean technology” because they are not subject to the same level of costly “command and control” regulation that is found in developed economies such as the United States. Indeed, under these circum- stances, it may be possible for ﬁrms to jointly optimize cost, quality, and environmental performance.

Our results imply that private valuations may in- corporate negative environmental externalities, even if the externalities take place in countries with lax envi- ronmental regulations and poorly protected environ- mental property rights. In addition, adopting stringent environmental standards may actually be more prof- itable than defaulting to lower local environmental standards. This may be a by-product of pressures in the developed world to make new technologies and equipment more environmentally friendly. It may also be that environmentally conscious ﬁrms are more diligent in reducing waste and improving resource productivity. The notion that MNE’s, as a group, pursue the lowest environmental standards and create a “race to the bottom” among developing countries desperate for foreign investments is not substantiated by the data. The most common corporate environmental practice in our sample is the opposite: adopting a stringent internal standard globally. We do not, how- ever, suggest that the race to the bottom does not exist. In fact, our ﬁndings also suggest that companies with lower market values tend to pursue lower environ- mental standards. Perhaps these companies opt to default to host country standards because they lack the means to make the investment in environmentally superior technology worldwide. They may also be less well-run companies focusing on short-term cost sav- ings. This might include, but is certainly not limited to, strategies such as recapitalizing old production assets, extending obsolete product life cycles, and exploiting low labor costs. From a public policy standpoint, then, there are clear implications regarding these results: Developing countries may indeed attract foreign investment by lowering environmental standards, but the type of companies they attract by doing so will be weaker (and more pollution-intensive) ﬁrms not investing in state-of-the-art plants and equipment. After a tempo- rary presence marked by the exploitation of the lower or poorly enforced host country standards, these com- panies may well end up fodder for those globally competitive ﬁrms which have adopted worldwide environmental standards and are reaping the compet- itive and market beneﬁts of that policy. Thus, devel- oping countries may be best served by promoting aggressive environmental objectives combined with a willingness to work collaboratively with the world’s leading MNEs to deﬁne and implement policies that facilitate “win-win” environmental solutions. The most important conclusion suggested by our results is that higher “quality” ﬁrms (as measured by Tobin’s q) appear to pollute less. Future research should examine this relationship in greater depth. Two future directions appear evident. First, our study was constrained by data availability. Future research should supplement the current data with more vari- ables, including ﬁrm reputation, more detailed infor- mation on ﬁrms’ actual environmental practices and performance, and a longer time series. Second, future work should aim to identify why ﬁrms adopt higher environmental standards. While we have proposed several plausible explanations here, examination of their validity awaits further research.16 16 The authors would like to thank the editor for her encouragement and the associate editor for insightful and penetrating comments.

The IRRC contains a record of each corporation’s declared stance regarding its international environmental standard: (1) the corporation adheres to local standards only; (2) the corpora- tion applies U.S. environmental standards wherever it does busi- ness; and (3) the corporation has its own internal environmental standard that exceeds any national standards. The assumption is that ﬁrms declaring a lower category of environmental standard are poorer environmental performers. This assumption requires validation. Full-scale validation is dif- ﬁcult because consistent and reliable pollution data at the plant level on a global scale do not exist, especially in developing countries. We therefore resorted to validating this assumption based on each ﬁrm’s U.S. “Toxic Release Inventory” (TRI) data, as reported in 1072 Management Science/Vol. 46, No. 8, August 2000 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:21 .

In the ﬁrst row, the results indicate whether the sample mean differs signiﬁcantly from 0. 1995.17 The IRRC (Investor Responsibility Research Center) tracks U.S. plants’ toxic releases (by weight) and reports for each company its ratio of toxic releases to sales and industry average. We created a variable, “relative emissions,” which is the difference between a ﬁrm’s U.S. toxic release/sales and industry average. We then examined how “relative emissions” varies with a company’s de- clared environmental standard. To determine the robustness of our results, we trimmed outliers that had student residuals greater than or equal to three. Table A1 reports the mean “relative emissions” by each declared class of environmental standard. The result is consistent with our expectation: Firms defaulting to “local standards” (Group 1) have the highest relative emissions, while ﬁrms applying “an internal global standard that exceeds any national standard” (Group 3) have the lowest relative emissions. Firms applying U.S. standards over- seas (Group 2) were in between these two extremes. We also conducted a regression analysis. Notice that we did not need to control for industrywide effects because the pollution measure has been standardized by industry average. We controlled for ﬁrm size (log of total dollars of assets) because of possible economies (or diseconomies) of scale in “polluting.” The regression analysis is reported in Table A2. The results are consistent with those in Table A1: (i) ﬁrms that “default to local environmental standards” pollute statistically signiﬁcantly more than ﬁrms that apply “an internal global standard;” (ii) ﬁrms that “default to local environmental standards” pollute more than ﬁrms that apply “U.S. standards,” but the difference is not statistically signiﬁcant; and (iii) 17 We have data for both 1994 and 1995. Using 1994 data generates similar results that are slightly less signiﬁcant but still acceptable. We chose to use the 1995 data because our records on corporate environmental standards for 1995 are more complete.

The overall model is signiﬁcant at the 5% level (F-value ⫽ 2.728) Numbers in parentheses are standard errors. ﬁrms that apply “U.S. standards” pollute more than ﬁrms that apply “an internal global standard,” but the difference is not statistically signiﬁcant. While the tests are relatively simple, they provide evidence that our Environmental Standard variable is valid and meaningful: Companies using a global environmental standard are relatively cleaner in the United States than those companies defaulting to host country standards abroad. This is especially signiﬁcant because companies that default to host country standards can, by deﬁnition, export their dirtiest processes to lax jurisdictions, an option that is not open to companies using a single global standard.
