This  study  collected  information  about  208  manufacture  firms  from  Taiwan;  we  investigated  the  contingent  effect of supply chain member involvement on product innovation performance. The result  indicate that external member involvement have positive impacts on a product innovation  performance, and third party involvement within the supplier involvement is found to be as  important  a  moderator  for  the  relationship  between  external  member  involvement  and  product  innovation  performance.  The  relationship  between  customer  involvement  and  market  performance  was  positively  moderated,  but  between  supplier  involvement  and  design performance was negatively moderated by third party involvement.

INTRODUCTION  One  of  prevailing  findings  in  concurrent  inter-firm  network  and  supply  chain  management  research is that customer and suppliers can reap great  potential  benefits  by  working  together  the  new  product  development  (NPD)  process.  Over  the  past  two decades, several researchers have shown that new  product  development  has  become  an  increasingly  important  to  the  development  and  maintenance  of  a  strong  position  increasingly  competitive  business  arena  [15,  56].  Consequently,  the  demands  on  new  product  development  performance,  in  terms  of speed, performance, quality, and cost, have become  more stringent. Today’s leading enterprises operate on  a  global  basis,  cooperating  with  suppliers,  partners,  and  a  multitude  of  stakeholders  to  deliver  product  in  an                                                    ∗ Corresponding author: chunshou@mail.hust.edu.tw    packages  [45].  Therefore,  new  product  development  must come from within the supply chain or network.  Companies  experience  constant  pressure  to  deliver superior value to the customers. In addition to  resource  inputs,  this  requires  a  set  of  processes  to  coordinate  efforts  and  improve  results.  Increasingly,  many  of  these  capabilities  and  resources  reside  outside the boundaries a single firm. Earlier and more  extensive  involvement  of  suppliers  and  customer  in  new  product  development  is  one  of  the  ways  companies can enhance product development in terms  of productivity, speed, quality [14, 50] market share,  sales volume, and market growth. Suppliers provide a  source  of  innovative  ideas  and  critical  technologies  [5,  12].  Customers  provide  demand  and  market  knowledge [35, 40, 65, 66]. However, several studies  demonstrate  that  managing  supplier  involvement  in  product  development  poses  several  challenges  [11,  30]. On the other hand, other scholars believe that the  network and the relationships in themselves have an  impact  on  how  industrial  firms  gain  and  deal  with  262  International Journal of Electronic Business Management, Vol. 10, No. 4 (2012)  rather  innovation.  the  contributions  of  channels.  Extant  research  on  innovation  in  supply  chain  relationships  focus  on  the  auto  industry  [14],  and  tend  to  emphasize  operations  and  total  quality  management  than  marketing.  However,  companies  do  not  develop  new  products  simply  to  improve quality or reduce costs. There are market and  financial  performance  incentives  as  well.  Therefore,  this study further clarifies the supply chain members  involved  in  the  new  product  development  process.  Specifically,  design  and  market  performance  help  three  distinguish  types  of  members.  This  study  argues  that  buyer-seller  interactions  in  the  supply  chain  affect  upstream  and  downstream  innovation  performance  refers  to  the  extent  to  that  product  innovation  reaches  its  target  [51].  In  the  past,  most  evaluations  of  product  innovation  performance  considered  and  market  performance [16]. In recent years, research evaluation  indicators  have  included  financial  performance  [46].  A  comparison  of  that  financial  performance  and  market  performance  evaluation indicators are very similar. To distinguish  them from general operational performance financial  indicators,  this  study  uses  design  performance  and  market  performance  to  evaluate  product  innovation.  From  an  academic  perspective,  this  framework  facilitates  a  better  understanding  of  the  innovation  process (Figure 1). these  approaches  shows  performance  Product  design  new knowledge. At the same time, relationships and  networks are not homogeneous, but tend to differ in  the  configurations  [6,  13].  Recently,  a  number  of  scholars have challenged the conventional notion that  innovations  in  the  supply  chain  context  originate  from  the  buyer  alone.  In  the  current  complex  technological  era,  is  a  multidisciplinary  activity  spanning  a  multiplicity  of  organizations, circumstances, and settings [28, 33, 43,  63, 68].  innovation  generation  that  research  on  [18,  55].  Scholars  agree  Based  on  this  concept,  this  study  shows  that  innovation results from interactions within buy-seller  relationships  that  a  substantial  part  of  the  innovation  process  occurs  between  buyers  and  sellers  in  the  supply  chain  [28,  36]. This has led to the emergence of a large body of  strategy-level  inter-firm  network  interaction  and  technical  development.

INTER-ORGANIZATION  COLLABORATION FOR  PRODUCT INNOVATION  WITHIN THE SUPPLY CHAIN    Marketing  shows  literature  that  inter-organization  collaboration  influences  product  innovation  performance.  This  inter-organization  collaboration  refers  to  two  or  more  organizations  jointly creating or using existing tactics or rules, and  cooperating  to  deal  with  the  various  types  of  work  and  challenges  in  an  environment  [2].  Firms  can  engage  in  collaboration  arrangements  for  product  innovation  with  several  types  of  partners.  These  universities,  partners  consultants,  and  competitors,  institutes,  research  research  include      inter-organization  technology  organizations,  and  other  associations.  However,  collaboration  with  competitors  can  cause  great  suspicion  due  to  the  potential  for  competitive  behavior.  Therefore,  this  study  suggests  that  competitors  are  less  likely  to  participate in new product development. Finally, this  study  explores  inter-organization  collaboration between suppliers, customers, and third  parties on performance.  the  effects  of  2.1 Effects of Customer Involvement  The  importance  of  lead  customers  in  defining  product  innovation,  and  therefore  reducing  the  risk  associated  with  the  market  introduction,  has  been  recognized  since  at  least  the  1970s  [24,  49,  52,  53,  59, 61, 62]. A review of previous studies reveals the  following  advantages  of  customer  involvement:    C. S. Lai et al.: The Involvement of Supply Chain Partners in New Product Development  263      that  including  providing  complementary  knowledge,  providing  an  understanding of customer demand; auxiliary pricing,  etc.  Gemunden,  Heydebreck,  and  Herden  [25]  showed  that  customer  contact  is  a  prerequisite  for  success, and that allowing customers to participate in  the  early  stages  of  new  product  development  is  important  [38].  Research  by  Sherman,  Souder,  and  Jenssen  (2000)  [54]  shows  the  customer in the R&D team reduces the development  time of new products. However, these findings are the  requirements;  result  of  a  company’s  one-way  customers  only  provide  the  participation is therefore relatively low. According to  Gadde  and  Snehota’s  [23]  classification  of  high  involvement,  a  high  level  of  customer  involvement  must include relation-specific investment and a high  level  of  interaction.  The  most  obvious  effect  of  customer participation in new product development is  better  time  performance  in  market  and  technical  development  [14,  54];  these  are  important  market  performance  indicators.  Previous  studies  show  that  customer  participation  primarily  affects  market  performance,  and  to  a  lesser  extent,  assists  in  technical  aspects  such  as  design  performance.  Therefore, this study infers the following hypothesis:  information,  and  H1:  The  greater  the  customer  involvement,  the  (a)  design  greater  performance and (b) market performance.    new  product’s  the  2.2 Effects of Supplier Involvement  innovation  performance  Research  on  new  product  development  shows  that  three  of  these  firm-centered  factors  include  design  for  cost,  design  for  quality,  and  design  for  manufacturability  are  important  for  the  creation  of  product  [14].  Looking  beyond the individual firm is necessary to recognize  the  importance  of  technology  knowledge  in  the  supply  chain  [58].  Although  many  studies  focus  on  integrating  customer  requirements  into  new  product  development  efforts  [26],  supplier  involvement  has  only  recently  received  significant  attention  [46].  Along  with  the  need  to  integrate  multiple  linked  processes  in  the  supply  chain,  theoretical  research  advocates  supplier  involvement  results  in  a  faster  development  process  [46, 21, 29].  extensive  early  allow  advantage  One  way  that  a  company  can  boost  its  competitive  supplier  involvement  in  design  and  product  development.  A  company  that  uses  supplier  expertise  to  enhance  its  in-house capability can reduce the time it takes for a  product  to  go  from  conception  to  the  market  place,  improving  cost  and  quality,  and  achieving  better  design performance [50]. Petersen et al. [46] used the  inclusion  of  suppliers  in  new  product  development  teams  to  verify  that  supplier  involvement  enhances  project  efficiency,  and  thus  influences  financial  that  and  to  is    performance  and  design  performance.  Song  and  Benedetto [57] found that good suppliers facilitate the  growth  of  a  product’s  market  share  and  improve  financial  performance.  Supplier  involvement  boosts  the design and market performance of manufacturers.  Therefore, this study hypothesizes the following:  H2:  The  greater  the  involvement  of  suppliers,  the  design  greater  performance, and (b) market performance.    product’s  new  the  (a)  2.3  Moderating  Effects  Involvement  of  Third  Party  the  true  believed  past,  many  technological  knowledge  [37,  41].  This  Universities and government research institutes  are important contributors to the creation of scientific  and  is  particularly  in  Taiwanese  universities  and  government  research  institutes  that  have  been  under  considerable pressure to move closer to industry. The  Taiwanese government has sought to encourage these  institutions  to  undertake  more  industrially  relevant  research  to  assist  the  competitiveness  of  Taiwanese  industry.  In  that  inter-organization  collaboration  improved  innovation  performance.  However,  some  research  shows  the  opposite to be the case. Wynstra, et al. [69] found that  early  supplier  involvement  does  not  lower  costs  or  improve  quality,  and  can  even  result  in  worse  than  expected  results.  Belderbos,  et  al.  [10]  showed  that  the involvement of third parties, such as universities  or  research  institutions,  could  improve  productivity  and  result  in  greater  sales  performance  in  the  innovative product market. Universities are therefore  an  for  companies  seeking  innovation  knowledge.  Lynch  and  O’Toole  [38]  conducted  a  survey  of  Ireland’s  manufacturing  industry  and  found  that  as  much  as  57%  of  respondents involved third parties in the new product  development. The main reasons for this involvement  included  requirements,  acquiring  expertise,  creating  market  opportunities,  and  lowering  costs,  risks,  and  development  time.  Therefore,  third  party  involvement in companies’ R&D can improve market  performance  acquire  the  company.

METHODS  3.2 Measures    3.1 Sample  The primary sample of this study consisted of  R&D  managers  and  executives  of  Taiwanese  manufacturers. This study examines four major types  of  manufacturing:  livelihood  industries  (including  SIC08,  09,  10,  11,  13,  14,  22,  31),  the  chemical  industry (including the SIC12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,  21),  information  and  electronic  industry  (including  the SIC 26, 27, 28, 30), and metal machinery industry  (including  the  SIC  23,  24,  25,  29).  These  industries  were  targeted  to  produce  a  large  enough  sample  for  subsequent  industry  analysis.  These  specific  SICs  were  chosen  because  they  are  some  of  the  most  visible  and  important  manufacturing  industries.  A  questionnaire was used for data collection. This study  received 245 surveys, but 37 of them were unusable  as  several  parts  were  missing  or  the  responses  appeared  them  unacceptable  for  data  analysis.  This  led  to  208  useable  responses.  Table  1  describes  the  sample  statistics  that  indicate  that  85.8%  of  the  responses  came  from  the  targeted  SIC  codes.

The  average  variance  extracted  (AVE)  of  the  measurable  variable  was  between  0.46  and  0.69,  except that customer involvement was lower than the  0.5 level recommended by Forrnel and Larcker [22];  the  others  variable  were  all  accepted.  These  results  show that the proposed measurement model achieved  a  good  convergent  validity.  Discriminant  validity  is  obtained when all pair wise latent-trait correlations of  constructs are significantly different from 1 [4]. Table  3  shows  that  our  construct  measures  met  this  requirement.  A  more  criterion  of  discriminate  validity  is  that  across  all  possible  pairs  of constructs the variance extracted for each construct  must  be  greater  than  the  squared  latent  correlation  between a pair of constructs [22].

RESULTS    Regarding  Following the Baron and Kenny [8] approach,  the  main  and  moderating  effects  were  tested  using  hierarchical multiple regression analyses. To mitigate  the  potential  of  multicollinearity,  each  scale  constituting  an  interaction  term  was  mean  centered  [1]. Table 4 summarizes the results.    the  hypotheses  external  organization involvement enhance product innovation  performance,  we  found  that  customer  involvement  was  significantly  related  to  market  performance  (β=.324  , p＜.001). However,  customer  involvement  was  significantly  related  to  design  performance  (β=.251,  p ＜ .001).  As  expected,  the  supplier  involvement  was  significantly  related  to  design  that      related  supplier  to  market  performance (β=.147, p＜.05), supporting Hypothesis  2a.  However,  involvement  was  not  significantly  performance  (Hypothesis  2b).  This  finding  revealed  a  different  facet  of  customer  involvement,  partially  supporting  Hypothesis  2a.  Moreover,  third  party  involvement  was  significantly  related  to  design  and  market  performance  (β=.323,  p ＜.001 ；β=.144,  p ＜.01).  Third  party  involvement  had  a  moderating  effect  on  the  relationship  between  supplier  involvement  and  design  performance  (β=.-.142,  p ＜ .05),  but  no  moderating  effect  on  market  performance.  This  means  that  higher  levels  of  third  party  involvement  increase  the  negative  relationship  between  suppliers  and  design  performance.  These  results  support  Hypothesis  3a,  but  not  Hypothesis  3b.  To  plot  this  interaction  effect,  we  constrained  the  variables  in  C. S.

DISCUSSION AND  SUGGESTIONS        5.1 Discussion  the  Previous  studies  typically  provide  relationship  between  limited  discussion  of  the  involvement of third-party supply chain partners and  product  innovation  performance.  Unlike  previous  studies,  the  current  study  explores  the  affects  of  supply  chain  partner  involvement  to  determine  the  influence that suppliers and customers have on design  in  collaborative  and  market  performance.  This  study  examines  the  moderating effect that third party involvement has on  inter-organization  interaction  relationships  and  product  innovation  performance.  This  study  finds  that  continuity  and  diversity  of  partner  collaboration  positively  affects  product  innovation  performance.

By examining the effects  of suppliers, customers, and third parties on product  innovation performance, this study shows that greater  supplier  design  performance. This may be due to the knowledge and  technology  provided  by  supplies  that  have  a  direct  effect on design performance and an indirect effect on  market  sales  performance.

The  integration  of  different  partners  will  create  different  affects  on  innovation  performance.  Therefore,  the  selection  of  a  suitable  is  crucial  for  a  firm.  The  significant  partner  differences  of  partners  can  determine  how  the  this  study  shows  in  a  that  can  268  International Journal of Electronic Business Management, Vol. 10, No. 4 (2012)    firm  can  be  achieved.  The  collaboration is managed and what kind of innovation  performance  specific  characteristics and objectives of each type of partner  suggest  that  different  partners  will  bring  different  results.  In  this  sense,  the  decision  to  pool  resources  with  another  organization  depends  on  weighing  the  risks  against  the  expected  results [47]. Supply  chain  partner  collaboration  allows  a  to  gain  considerable  knowledge  about  new  technology,  market,  and  process  improvement  [67]  and  has  a  more  significant  impact  on  product  innovation  [39].  By considering the individual impact of each type of  partner,  this  study  shows  that  supplier  involvement  are  the  single  partners  who  most  impact  on  the  achievement  of  product  design  with  more  degree  of  performance. When third party and suppliers involved  in  new  product  development  process  at  the  same  time,  its  impact  is  weakened.  This  finding  indicates  that  some  factors  remain  to  be  explored.  Future  research stage to the sequence from the process and  the individual has knowledge of the essence.  5.2 Implications for Management  The  findings  of  this  study  contain  useful  managerial  implications.

This  study  shows  that  different  types  of  collaborative  relationships  can  be  a  critical  success  factor  in  achieving innovative products. The practical value of  these  findings  lies  in  better  understanding  how  the  type  of  a  collaborative  relationship  affects  its  own  performance. Therefore, managers must be aware of  the  importance  of  partner  suitability,  network  mechanisms, and continuity of collaboration, as these  are  the  factors  that  determine  superior  collaborative  performance  the  development of the firm’s competitive advantage.    in  product  innovation  and  This  study  shows  that  the  involvement  of  different  external  organizations  produces  different  results.

It would  be  desirable  to  have  complete  information  on  the  degree  of  product  innovation,  either  using  a  richer  category  of  innovation  or  qualitative  measures  of  innovation  performance.  In  addition,  this  study  examines  third-party  participation  using  only  universities  and  government  research  institutions.  However,  the  definition  of  a  wider  range  of  third-party organizations could further distinguish the  effects  of  such  as  manufacturing  and  services,  technology  and  market  knowledge, etc.  third-party  organizations,  research  third-party  research  and  development,  New technology, patent number, or the cause of  sudden  emergence  of  a  new  phenomenon,  the  University  can  see  the  importance  of  other  research  institutions;  as  institutions  (universities  and  research  institutions)  than  to  focus  more  on  basic  science  research  enterprise  that  enterprise  more  emphasis  on  innovative  research  to  improve existing products, especially product quality  improvement  and  cost  reduction  on.  Therefore,  new  technologies or new businesses should emphasize the  participation  of  third-party  research  organizations  [48].  Most  technologies  coming  out  of  universities  are  at  the  early  stages  of  development  [60].  The  commercialization  of  such  emerging  technologies  often takes a long time, while the development of this  stage  is  usually  a  sudden  correction  or  refining  conditions,  and  further  develop  firm  business  new  model’s  [20].  This  study  shows  that  when  business  has the need for external organizations to participate  in  individual  organizations  participating  in  product  design  performance have a positive influence on the results.  However,  when  the  company  involves  third-party  suppliers  and  research  institutions  in  new  product  development,  the  effect  was  less  significant.  This  result  agrees  with  the  previous  study,  showing  that  when the basic research expertise of universities and  research  institutions  is  applied  to  the  interaction  of  suppliers, it is less effective. This study suggests that  for  enterprises  wishing  to  improve  the  quality  of  existing  products  or  decrease  supplier  costs  using  technical  knowledge,  improving  product  design  performance will be a significant help. However, care  must  be  taken  when  introducing  the  basic  scientific  research  of  third-party  researchers  due  to  differing  objectives,  schedules,  and  cognitive  differences.  Future  studies  should  examine  different  product  innovation and industry life cycles to confirm if this  difference  really  exists.

Future  studies  may  extend  this  concept  using  other  methodologies  and  sources  of information.  This  study  focuses  on  the  effects  of  manufacturing  industry  suppliers,  customers,  and  third parties on product innovation performance, and  is  not  applicable  to  all  industries.  For  example,  it  is  not applicable to the hot topic of service innovation.  Future  research  on  this  topic  should  examine  the  service  industry  or  non-profit  organizations,  and  explore the effects that external organizations have on  innovation performance. Secondly, in addition to the  moderating variable of third party that is employed in  this  study,  future  research  should  consider  other  variables or mechanisms, such as the discovery by De  Luca and Atuahene-Gima (2007) [17] that knowledge  integration mechanisms have a moderating effect on  product  innovation  performance  in  inter-functional  cooperation.  Further  could  examine  inter-organizational  collaboration  and  innovation  performance.  Lastly,  we  would  like  to  point  out  the  generalizability of these finding. Although the data in  this  study  is  limited  to  Taiwan,  the  patterns  of  collaboration  in  Taiwan  are  similar  to  those  of  the  China.    research  REFERENCES    1.
