IS HIGH EMPLOYEE TURNOVER REALLY HARMFUL?  AN EMPIRICAL TEST USING COMPANY RECORDS  ARIE C. GLEBBEEK  ERIK H. BAX  University of Groningen  We tested the hypothesis that employee turnover and firm performance have an  inverted U-shaped relationship: overly high or low turnover is harmful. Our analysis  was based on economic performance data from 110 offices of a temporary employment  agency. These offices had high variation in turnover but were otherwise similar,  allowing control for important intervening variables. Regression analysis revealed a  curvilinear relationship; high turnover was harmful, but the inverted U-shape was not  observed with certainty.  We1 are not the first to conclude that a remark  able imbalance exists in the literature on employee  turnover. While much has been written about the  determinants of turnover, little has been published  about its effects. The research literature is domi  nated by analyses in which turnover is treated as  the dependent variable (e.g., Griffeth & Horn, 1995;  Lee & Mowday, 1987; Morrow, McElroy, Laczniak,  & Fenton, 1999). In general, researchers have set  out to define factors that predict some empirical  measurement of actual turnover, or they have used  an indicator such as individuals' intentions to  leave a job, or both (Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, Sablyn  ski, & Erez, 2001).  Studies that treat employee turnover as an inde  pendent variable are relatively scarce. This imbal  ance in the research on employee turnover was  noted as' early as 1982, when Mobley wrote that  "relative to the causes of turnover, consequences  have been underemphasized" (Mobley, 1982: 31).  In 1980, Staw explicitly pointed out the potential  danger of a research practice that concentrates on  the causes of employee turnover while neglecting  its effects: such research is based on the assump  tion that turnover is an important organizational  problem and should be dealt with accordingly.  Hence, potential positive effects for organizations  are overlooked (Staw, 1980). Research on turnover  has not really changed direction since then. In  1989, Mueller and Price again pleaded for research  into the consequences of turnover rather than into  The authors thank Germaine van Bree, Hans Ooteman,  and Raimond L.

Nevertheless, in the Human Re  source Management Review's 1999 special issue on  employee turnover, all papers treated turnover as a  dependent variable and not as an independent one.  "While thousands of studies have investigated why  employees choose to leave their jobs, very little  research has directly examined the organizational  consequences associated with voluntary employee  turnover/' one of the authors observed (Williams,  1999: 549). In another journal, we have read this:  "While there is an immense literature covering the  subject of personnel turnover, there is a paucity of  writing on the impact of turnover on the organiza  tion" (Hutchinson, Villalobos, & Beruvides, 1997:  3202). It is significant that neither of these articles  mentions even one relevant title.  Even Griffeth, Horn, and Gaertner's (2000) meta  analysis of the domain, which they described as "a  final review of turnover research conducted in the  20th century" (2000: 463), was explicitly limited to  the causes of turnover, thereby completely neglect  ing its effects. We agree with Hutchinson and his  colleagues that "this dearth of studies on the im  pact of turnover is especially surprising, since it is  presumably the assumed impact of turnover on or  ganizational effectiveness which has prompted so  much turnover research in the first place"  (Hutchinson et al., 1997: 3203).  We have found only three recent studies that  report on the effects of turnover. In all these cases,  the topic is treated more or less as a side issue. The  three studies yield evidence that suggests a nega  tive effect of employee turnover on organizational  performance, but the effects are small (Huselid,  1995), not significant (Koys, 2001) or "preliminary"  (Baron, Hannan, & Burton, 2001), resulting from the  fact that the research design was not developed  with this specific issue in mind. Therefore, impor  tant control variables such as absenteeism could This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:55:23 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  278 Academy of Management Journal April  not be considered. Furthermore, it remains uncer  tain whether the effects of turnover were linear or  only manifest beyond a certain level.  One must therefore conclude that there seems to  be no tradition of empirical research into the effects  of employee turnover. The reason for this omission  is probably twofold: first, companies are often un  willing to provide the necessary data, and second,  when data are available, they do not enable re  searchers to control for spurious relationships. In  the next section, we will explain that, as an unfor  tunate consequence of all this, a sound theoretical  model concerning the effects of employee turnover  has remained untested. As a result, it has gone  largely unnoticed in subsequent turnover research.  In this study, we tested that theoretical model. As  this model deviates from the assumptions common  in turnover research, this test should also make a  substantial contribution to the existing knowledge  on turnover effects.  THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND  HYPOTHESES  Much research on the causes of turnover has  been inspired by the thought that turnover is costly  to firms and should therefore be prevented if pos  sible. This assumption was popular in the consult  ants' literature of the 1990s (e.g., Herman, 1997;  White, 1995). In the theoretical literature, a more  balanced view on turnover has been upheld, ac  cording to which turnover may actually yield ben  efits (e.g., Staw, 1980). This view has led to the  well-known proposal that firms and researchers  distinguish "functional" from "dysfunctional"  turnover (Dalton, Krackhardt, & Porter, 1981). In  the aggregate, these ideas suggest that a firm's turn  over level can be too high or too low.  This insight was expressed 20 years ago by Abel  son and Baysinger (1984), in their "optimal turn  over" model, which can still be regarded as the  standard theoretical model for inferring the conse  quences of turnover. Yet their model is not often  applied, and it has left few traces in the empirical  literature on turnover. The question, of course, is  why this model has had so little impact.  The starting point for Abelson and Baysinger  (1984) is the fact that many companies and re  searchers admit that turnover is not always dys  functional. They do, however, dismiss as inade  quate the most common solution of distinguishing  between valuable and expendable employees (im  plying that turnover should only be prevented for  the former), as companies do not even retain valu  able employees at all costs. Apart from higher  wages and fringe benefits, a number of other expen  ditures are inherent in tempting an employee to  stay (pleasant working conditions, high job auton  omy, flexible working hours, and so forth). There  fore, a firm has to find a balance between the costs  of turnover and the costs of avoiding it. As these  turnover and retention costs are opposing forces,  simple economic reasoning tells us that the rela  tionship between employee turnover and the firm  economic performance has to be an inverted U  shaped curve. Figure 2 of the article by Abelson  and Baysinger (1984) is a graph of this relationship.  Performance is placed on the Y-axis, and the rate of  turnover, on the X-axis. On the left side of the  figure, the curve is upward sloping (representing a  positive relation between turnover and perfor  mance), and on the right, the curve is downward  sloping (representing a negative relation).  This theory implies that, for every company,  there is an optimal turnover rate, which can be  defined as "the rate that minimizes the sum of the  costs of turnover plus the costs associated with  reducing it" (Abelson & Baysinger, 1984: 333). At  the same time, however, the theory implies that the  optimal turnover rate is not the same for all organ  izations. "The optimal turnover rate for different  organizations is likely to vary according to differ  ences in circumstances that influence the balance  point between retention and turnover costs. Be  cause this is peculiar to individual organizations,  there probably is no general benchmark for the  optimal, nonzero rate of turnover" (Abelson &  Baysinger, 1984: 335, emphasis added).  How then can an organization find out where its  optimal turnover rate lies or?what is perhaps more  relevant to everyday practice?on which side of the  curve the organization finds itself? At this point,  Abelson and Baysinger's article follows a course  that, we believe, may explain the lack of impact it  has had. Instead of offering the promised guide  lines for "on-site evaluation of whether or not ob  served turnover rates are optimal" (Abelson &  Baysinger, 1984: 332), the authors ask their readers  to perform an analysis that would discourage any  human resource manager.  The basis of this approach is a conceptual model  that shows how individual, organizational, and en  vironmental factors all influence the "individually  perceived costs and benefits of quitting or staying."  These costs in turn lead to an "individual quit  propensity" that, together with the number of em  ployees, produces the "baseline aggregate organiza  tional turnover rate." Somehow, the human re  source managers of an organization have to acquire  a notion of this baseline rate and then estimate the  turnover and retention costs that would support a  policy aimed at the reduction of this baseline. This This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:55:23 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2004 Glebbeek and Bax 279  implies that human resource managers have to fa  miliarize themselves with the determinants of turn  over before they can estimate its effects.  Learning these determinants would require no  less than a massive research program. Even the "not  exhaustive" list of possibly relevant factors that  Abelson and Baysinger present (for instance, eco  nomic conditions, skill levels, types of rewards de  sired, staffing strategies, housing prices, local pub  lic services, medical facilities, and so forth) is very  long. "All of these attributes may influence (1) quit  propensities and turnover rates and/or (2) the costs  of turnover and retention for any given level of  turnover.. . . Thus, it is important for future re  search to examine which of these numerous vari  ables influence aggregate optimal organizational  turnover rates and the extent of this influence"  (Abelson & Baysinger, 1984: 339). Only a mammoth  alliance of managers and researchers could accom  plish such a task.  Even for academic researchers, it would be diffi  cult if not impossible to identify a level of optimal  turnover with the help of this method. Gigantic  quantities of data would be needed to put all the  necessary control variables in place. It is with good  reason that Abelson and Baysinger proposed limit  ing these endless variations by performing the nec  essary analyses for a series of similar companies  under similar conditions. For example, all hospi  tals in a particular region could provide the objects  of study. For this population, the relationship be  tween employee characteristics, organizational fac  tors, and other independent variables on the one  hand and turnover rates on the other would have to  be established. This process would yield regression  weights that could subsequently be combined with  the specific characteristics of a specific organiza  tion. An estimate of the baseline aggregate turnover  rate ofthat organization could then be obtained. We  propose calling this procedure multivariate bench  marking.  Even with this less elaborate version, it might  prove impossible to find enough organizations in  sufficiently comparable circumstances to extract an  externally validated turnover criterion. Further  more, the empirically derived coefficients might  soon be outdated, as the relevant relationships  change over time. As Baysinger and Abelson them  selves admitted, local and cyclical economic fluc  tuations strongly influence the propensity of em  ployees to quit. Finally, it is likely that interactions  between variables would make a linear transforma  tion of a regression coefficient to a specific organi  zation impossible. In short, we have to conclude  that Abelson and Baysinger (1984) have set re  searchers and practitioners an impossible task by  linking the application of their model to data that  have to be obtained outside a given company itself.  It is our belief that this is the main reason why  this elegant and plausible model has not swept the  field. The authors rightly stated that once the no  tion of an optimal rate of turnover is widely ac  cepted, "research into turnover should capture this  possibility in its premises'' (Abelson & Baysinger,  1984: 332, emphasis added). However, as our liter  ature review has already revealed, the reverse  seems to be true. "Although recognizing that each  firm may have an optimal rate of turnover [Abelson  & Baysinger, 1984], in this study I assumed that low  rates of turnover are preferred to high rates,"  Huselid (1995: 65) wrote?thus formulating what  might be called the "conventional assumption of  turnover research."  The objective of our study was twofold. Firstly,  we sought to demonstrate that Abelson and  Baysinger's theory on the effects of turnover is  essentially correct. Our central hypothesis is  therefore:  Hypothesis 1. The overall relationship between  employee turnover and firm performance has  an inverted U-shape.  Secondly, we intend to demonstrate that the  analysis concerned can be performed with intraov  ganizational data?that is, company records. As  suming these two goals are met, this article should  provide a practical guideline for managers who  wish to find out for themselves on which side of the  optimal turnover curve their firm lies.  METHODS  It is not easy to empirically test Abelson and  Baysinger's curve. To do that, one would need data  from different firms or departments with different  turnover rates (or, alternatively, data from one firm  or department taken at different times). However,  in these situations the relationship between turn  over and performance is usually burdened with so  many other differences between the organizations  that the underlying curve easily becomes obscured.  Normally, it is impossible to control for all these  differences statistically. Besides, when control  variables exceed a certain number, there is a risk of  arbitrariness in the models. By some good fortune,  we obtained a data set that was almost ideally  suited for our purpose.  Data  Our data originate from a temporary job agency  that has offices spread throughout The Nether This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:55:23 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  280 Academy of Management Journal April  lands. The company functions in a highly compet  itive and dynamic segment of the private service  sector. Temping is a major business in The Nether  lands; the total number of temp jobs equaled 3.5  percent of Dutch employment in 1996. The vast  increase of flexible labor, in combination with a  general, rapid growth of employment, has been de  scribed as the "Dutch miracle" of the labor market.  Although the profits of the firm we studied  largely depended on the turnover in other organi  zations, the firm itself benefited by having a loyal  and experienced staff. The subject of our study was  this staff, comprising intermediaries, supervisors,  office managers, and support staff. In the period to  which our data refer, 1995-98, the agency's staff  grew from 667 to 1,894 employees. (In the same  period, the agency's average volume of daily work  ing temp employees increased from 18,500 to  39,000.) Our units of observation were those offices  active during the whole period 1995-98; we omit  ted from the analysis about 100 offices that began  activity in this period and 2 offices that ceased  activity. We also omitted the data of one office with  a turnover percentage of zero, as we considered it  lent an artificial bias: the office was primarily ac  tive in an area dominated by seasonal employment,  and employees from other offices were temporarily  relocated there. A total of 110 offices were included  in the analysis.  The offices studied varied highly in staff turn  over but were similar in product and operational  management. In fact, the firm consisted of nearly  identical units that provided an identical product.  Consequently, we kept constant a number of factors  potentially affecting turnover effects, including  skill composition, firm-specific human capital, and  learning curves. Because of the strong similarities  between the offices, a unique opportunity to test  the effects of employee turnover on office perfor  mance presented itself. If the Abelson and Baysinger  curve does exist, it should manifest itself here.  The agency's management was convinced that  the firm was on the right-hand side of the curve.  Turnover was indeed an issue. After being at an  average of 16 percent throughout 1995-97, it had  risen to 18 percent in 1998. In that year, a quarter of  all offices had turnover of more than 25 percent,  and some had more than 40 percent. In the com  pany's 1999 Plan of Operations, top management  complained that "a turnover rate too high jeopar  dizes the quality of service and costs a lot of  money." Its target for 1999 was a decrease in turn  over of one-third.  We used several data sources, but all were offi  cial firm statistical records. Data on the financial  performance of the offices were taken from the  central accounts of the firm's headquarters. Data on  the number of employees, absenteeism, and turn  over came from the company's automated person  nel files. Of course, our use of firm records did not  completely guarantee the reliability of the data, but  the principle that unreliability is generally random  and therefore suppresses existing relationships ap  plied here. There was no basis for believing that a  systematic bias in the data could artificially pro  duce the relationship we meant to test.  Measures  Turnover. We measured the turnover rate of an  office in a conventional way, using the formula  number of leavers during year/average number of  workers during same year. Although other formulas  are conceivable (cf. Mobley, 1982), this one "is in  widespread use and offers advantages of clarity and  simplicity of calculations" (Wild & Dawson, 1972:  3). In this measure "worker" is defined as a person  and not as a full-time equivalent (FTE). To obtain  the average number of office staff employed per  office per year, we measured on three dates, Janu  ary 1, July 1, and December 31, and divided the  sum total by three. District managers, supporting  staff at the district level, and all personnel not  engaged in operational functions were excluded  from the analyses and from the turnover figures.  Performance. Since the bulk of the potential  costs and benefits of turnover are indirect (Sailors &  Sylvestre, 1994), it is advisable to take the total  economic performance of an office as a measure of  the effects of turnover (Staw, 1980). However, this  dependent variable of our study is more difficult to  grasp than the independent one. Temp agencies  usually measure their performance in three differ  ent ways. The first is the number of temp hours  "sold" by an office. The second is the annual sales  made by an office: the total number of temp hours  multiplied by the price per hour. As with the first  measure, one can calculate sales per full-time  equivalent and use the result to compare one office  with another. However, this procedure does not  give insight into profitability: even if an office pro  duces below the break-even point, sales may be  impressive. The third measure, the gross result of  an office, provides the desired insight into profit  ability because it equals sales (second measure)  minus the direct wage costs of the temp workers  involved. However, it does not include other im  portant costs, such as office staff wages and over  head. This is unfortunate, as the wage costs of  the office staff are directly related to the level of  turnover.  In order to solve these problems, we developed a This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:55:23 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2004 Glebbeek and Bax 281  fourth measure, the net result per office. This mea  sure was made by taking the gross result per office  and subtracting the wage costs of the office staff.  For a complete picture of an office's contribution to  the firm's profit, overhead costs made for office  space and publicity might also be subtracted from  the results. We did not do this, as the office staff  could not influence the greater part of these costs  and, consequently, these costs had no clear rela  tionship to performance in an office. However, one  could well argue that turnover-related costs such as  those for recruitment and selection would now be  obscured by the label "overheads." Given the struc  ture of the data available, these costs could not be  specified separately. Consequently, because the re  sults of the offices with a relatively high level of  recruitment and selection activities would be esti  mated as too positive, any potential bias resulting  from this procedure would flatten out the right  hand side of the inverted U-shaped curve, thus  weakening the hypothesized relationship (that is,  the bias is conservative). Therefore, although our  measure was not perfect, it suited our purpose,  especially as it embraced all the "hidden costs" of  turnover that may be regarded as being crucial to  the research (Sailors & Sylvestre, 1994).  The correlations between these four measures  and the turnover rates of the offices show the rele  vance of the choice for a particular performance  measure. These correlations are -.45, -.42, -.39,  and -.23, respectively. It is notably the net result  (-.23) that differs. Its relation to turnover is con  siderably weaker than is the case for the other three  performance measures. This observation is in line  with the arguments presented above. More than in  the other measures, in the net result the positive  effects of turnover, such as economizing on costs,  are expressed. Consequently, if the management of  our temp agency were to estimate the effects of  turnover using the three traditional measures, the  estimate of its disadvantages would be too high.  Performance or change in performance. An  other choice to be made concerned the question of  whether the effect of turnover manifests itself in  level of performance or in change in performance.  The measures described above all relate to the av  erage results for an office over a given time period.  Differences in performance caused by factors in the  past and not caught by control variables might con  tinue to affect the dependent variable and thus the  relationships at stake. For this reason, some re  searchers consider a change in performance to be  the preferred criterion. Thus, Baron and coauthors  (2001: 1003-1007) analyzed the rise in sales of  Silicon Valley firms by taking the sales of the first  year of the period of research as a predictor for the  sales in the last year of the period. This is an ade  quate way of modeling change in performance. All  the variance in the dependent variable that already  existed in the first year is captured by the first-year  variable, so the remaining variance must be the  result of ensuing achievements. An additional ad  vantage of this procedure is that it automatically  corrects for differences between the offices that  show up in past performance.  We did not have a preference for one particular  dependent variable. Rather, it was our view that the  hypothesized effect of turnover, if robust, would  appear in both. In order to test this robustness, we  analyzed the data in both ways. Table 2 presents  the results of analyses in which the average level of  net result per office was the dependent variable;  Table 3 presents results in which we estimated the  change in results using Baron et al.'s (2001)  method. In the latter case, to avoid contamination,  we used the average result per office over the last  three years of the period as the dependent variable.  Causality. This important issue was the subject  of a preliminary analysis. An obvious objection to  the relationship presented by us is that it is not  turnover that causes performance, but performance  that causes turnover. This problem of causal inter  pretation is endemic to cross-sectional analysis and  can only be solved by presenting longitudinal data.  Following Koys's (2001) approach, we used the fact  that we had data covering several years and con  ducted two "mirrored" analyses, one in which  turnover preceded performance and one in which it  followed performance. Like Koys, we employed  cross-lagged regression analysis. We split the total  four-year period into two parts of two years each. If  the reversed-causality theory held, 1997-98 turn  over should have been more strongly related to  1995-96 performance than the other way around.  The outcomes clearly show that this was not the  case. Regression tables cannot be presented be  cause of space limitations, but the results can be  summarized by the correlations. When turnover  rates preceded the four performance measures in  time, the correlations were -.34, -.35, -.34, -.15,  respectively. When this sequence was reversed, the  correlations dropped to -.02, -.03, -.01, -.03. We  therefore concluded that the performance of the  offices could indeed be seen as being influenced by  turnover and not as the cause of turnover.  Time lag. It may take some time before a firm's  performance reflects the effects of turnover. How  ever, as there is no compelling theoretical argument  with respect to the term within which these effects  should manifest themselves (almost immediately,  after a year, or after two years?), there is no a priori  reason for preferring an analysis with time lag over This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:55:23 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  282 Academy of Management Journal April  an analysis without time lag. Therefore, we per  formed both. If the curvilinear effect were robust, it  would show in both analyses. In the tables, the  panel labeled "A" gives the cross-sectional results  (over the whole four-year period), and "B" gives the  lagged results based on the division into two peri  ods mentioned above.  Control Variables  If, as we believe, the Abelson and Baysinger  curve is fundamental, its appearance should not be  dependent on extremely complex models with a  range of control variables. Few theoretically con  ceivable control variables are to be found in daily  practice, and requiring them would have greatly  reduced the practical value of our approach. We  wanted our analysis to be as straightforward as  possible, but three control variables remained in  evitable.  Absenteeism. Turnover and absenteeism owing  to sickness may be related if they are caused by a  common factor, such as high work pressure or bad  human relations, thereby obscuring the fact that  any negative effects are caused entirely by absen  teeism and not by turnover (cf. Morrow et al.,  1999). Therefore, it is difficult but crucial to control  for absenteeism in an analysis of the effects of turn  over. The personnel files provided a percentage  based on the total number of calendar days lost to  sickness per year (corrected for part-time contracts;  pregnancy and maternity leaves were excluded).  Age. Younger people are more inclined to leave  jobs than older employees, and wages and salaries  (and thus employee costs) are generally age-related.  Controlling for the average age of the office staff  was therefore necessary for avoiding artificial  effects.  Region. As they do elsewhere, economic struc  tures and performance vary in different parts of The  Netherlands. These economic differences affected  the results of the offices studied, especially as the  temp business is strongly dependent on the nature  and volume of economic activity in its region. Also,  the level of turnover will be linked to the state of a  regional labor market. The Netherlands is com  monly seen as having an economic center (the  Randstad), a middle region, and an economic pe  riphery. In terms of this conventional regional clas  sification, 43 percent of the offices we studied were  located in the economic center, 39 percent were in  the middle area, and 18 percent were in the periph  ery. As expected, the data showed that the average  results of the offices varied according to the eco  nomic strength of their respective regions (net re  sults in the periphery were only 72 percent of the  average), and turnover was higher in the tight labor  market of the Randstad (18.5 percent as opposed to  16.2 percent on average). Therefore, a regional clas  sification was included as a control variable in the  analysis.  RESULTS  Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the  variables that were included in the analysis. In the  table, one can observe negative correlations be  tween our performance measures and the turnover  rates. This is a first and preliminary indication that  the firm's top management assumptions were cor  rect. As one can see, no high correlations between  the independent variables exist (they only occur  between periodic variables that are entered in sep  arate models), so multicollinearity is not a problem.  Neither did we find other major violations of the  Correlations, Means, and Standard Deviations3  TABLE 1  Variable  Mean s.d.  1. Turnover 16.2 5.7  2. Turnover, 1995-1996 14.2 10.9 .64  3.

We analyzed four models. The results are pre  sented in Tables 2 and 3. In model 1, the net results  of the offices are regressed against turnover only  (and of course against the net result in the first year,  when the change in performance is at stake). In  model 2 we added the control variables for absen  teeism and for the age of the office staff, and in  model 3 we introduced economic region. This pro  cedure allowed us to map the hypothesized rela  tionship. The negative correlation between turn  over and net result held if we controlled for age and  absenteeism, and even increased if we also consid  ered the regional factor. In model 3, turnover, ab  senteeism, and region all had significant, and ex  pected, effects on office performance. Either the  level of performance (Table 2) or the change in  performance (Table 3) can be used as the criterion.  The unstandardized regression coefficient (not  shown) of turnover in Table 2 indicates that a 1  percent increase in turnover equals a loss of 1,780  Dutch guilders, which is approximately 2.25 per  cent of one FTE employee's contribution to the net  result. From a management point of view, this is  quite substantial. Therefore, the volume of turnover  did have negative effects for the firm studied.  In model 4, we added curvilinearity to the anal  Results of Regression Analysis of the Effect of Employee Turnover  on the Change in Performance of the Offices*  TABLE 3  A. Net Result, 1996-98  B.

This was done in the conventional way, by  adding the squared term of turnover to the regres  sion equation. If the inverted U-curve is underly  ing, meaning that turnover is beneficial up to a  certain level and harmful after that point, then the  squared term should reflect this pattern by taking  the negative sign while the linear term becomes  positive. This is indeed shown in Tables 2 and 3.  Although the variance explained remained about  the same, the breaking down of the turnover vari  able suggested that it is predominantly an excessive  degree of turnover that had the negative effect on  performance. Both the cross-sectional (panel A)  and the longitudinal (panel B) analyses revealed  this pattern. The curvilinear effect most strongly  manifested itself when we allowed for a time lag.  This result may indicate that the costs of turnover  indeed are "hidden" and become apparent mainly  in the long run (Saylors & Sylvestre, 1994).  Do these findings provide enough evidence in  favor of our hypothesis? There may be some doubts  if one looks at significance. In all cases, after the  addition of the squared term, the linear effect be  comes positive, clearly pointing toward an inverted  U-shaped relationship. The coefficients are not sig  nificant, however. Moreover, the negative effect?  now captured by the squared term?fails to pass the  significance test in one of the four analyses. What  does this mean for the hypothesis?  First of all, model 4 may be overstretching our  data. Splitting up a significant effect into two par  tial effects with opposite signs reduces the chance  that these partial effects are independently signifi  cant. Requiring significance is asking a lot of the  statistical power of the test and, of course, when  there are only 110 cases, this power is limited.  More specifically, the analysis suggests that the  optimal turnover level in this firm lies between 6.3  and 9.9 percent. (This range is based on calculation  of the first derivative from the unstandardized co  efficients in the regressions of Table 2). Only be  tween 5.5 and 14 percent of the offices stayed be  low this level, which indicates that turnover was  generally too high in this firm. Thus, when the data  are graphed, the right part of the inverted U is  particularly apparent. This may help to explain the  lack of significance of the positive effects in model  4. At the times when the offices are more evenly  distributed along the curve, negative and positive  effects should both be significant.  However, the above is speculation. We acknowl  edge that, by conventional standards, the results  are ambiguous. Curvilinearity is clearly indicated,  but the nature of this nonlinearity (inverted U or  otherwise) is only suggested by the regression co  efficients. We therefore offer the reader two possi  ble interpretations.  Our "strong interpretation" is that the changing  sign of the main effect indicates an inverted U  curve. Statistical insignificance only reflects the  lack of statistical power that follows from the fact  that there are a mere 110 cases, with only a minor  ity of these situated at the left of the top of the  curve.  On the other hand, our cautious interpretation is  that the insignificance of the positive effects indi  cates that they do not really deviate from zero. The  pattern of linear and squared terms thus only re  flects a kink in the curve. First, the effects of higher  turnover are neutral (a sort of plateau), and then  after a critical point a higher turnover rate becomes  unprofitable.  As we believe in the arguments put forward by  Abelson and Baysinger, we tend to accept the first  interpretation. Academic conventions regarding  the interpretation of statistical insignificance may,  however, call for the second, cautious, interpreta  tion. It is important to note, though, that both in  terpretations are at odds with the conventional  assumption that higher turnover should be unprof  itable all along the line.  DISCUSSION  The authors of human resource management  (HRM) textbooks will find our main results encour  aging. In that literature, turnover is often used as a  performance indicator (e.g., G?mez-Mej?a, Balkin,  & Cardy, 1995), implying that "it is generally  viewed as negatively related to organizational ef  fectiveness" (Phillips, 1996: 180). Consequently,  Phillips included this indicator in his six-item Hu  man Resources Effectiveness Index, stating that "an  excessive turnover rate clearly has a tremendous  negative impact on an organization's costs, and HR  programs designed to reduce turnover can result in  a tremendous bottom-line improvement" (Phillips,  1996: 180). As usual, this author offers no hard  empirical evidence, although some bivariate corre  lations are presented in support of the index. The  author later acknowledges that the cost of turnover  is "an illusionary figure in most organizations"  (Phillips, 1996: 286), forcing analysts to rely on soft  data. As we observed before, this state of affairs is  explained by the fact that little is known, or indeed  could be known, about the empirical effects of em  ployee turnover, because relevant data sources are  not accessible.  Our analysis shows that turnover can have neg  ative effects on firm performance. Here we empha  size the word "can," since economic performance This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:55:23 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2004 Glebbeek and Bax 285  depends on many factors that vary according to  type of firm and related circumstances. This depen  dence on many factors is also reflected in the weak  relation between the variables in our analysis: even  in the most elaborate model of Table 2, the variance  explained does not rise above 18.5 percent. It is  clear that, although employee turnover does ex  plain part of the variation in the performance of the  temporary agency offices studied here, other vari  ables affect their performance to a much greater  degree.  This last conclusion is of course also implied in  Abelson and Baysinger's model. If turnover effects  are inverted-U-shaped, they will not, on average, be  very large. We argued above that, although Abelson  and Baysinger laid down the fundamentals of a  theory of turnover effects, their work has gone  largely unnoticed in turnover research. We believe  this lack of notice can be attributed to a misdirected  operational foundation. We hope that, with our  research, based on a different empirical approach  and testing, this model will be granted the place in  management theory that it deserves.  Of course we acknowledge that, although curvi  linearity is clearly indicated, our results have not  yielded compelling evidence for the existence of  the inverted U-shaped curve. We believe the ab  sence of compelling evidence can be attributed to  the limitations of our study. The most important  limitation is the restricted time period. The data  pertain to the years 1995 through 1998, when The  Netherlands was economically booming. As a re  sult, most offices of our focal agency had to contend  with extraordinarily high turnover rates, and only a  few offices found themselves placed in the range  where a higher turnover would have led to better  results. The chances of testing the inverted U-curve  were thus reduced. It would therefore be good to  replicate this study in times of economic down  turn, when turnover figures are much lower and  many companies would welcome some mobility.  Yet the apparent curvilinearity already implies that  both researchers and textbook writers cannot safely  assume that a lower rate of turnover is always pref  erable to a higher rate.  This finding will complicate future research into  turnover. It implies that the conventional assump  tion is not generally justified. For research that only  includes turnover as a control variable, the solution  is simple: always add the squared term to the re  gression equation (just as labor economists make it  standard practice to include an age-squared term  when estimating wage equations or human capital  models). As for the use of turnover as a perfor  mance indicator, things are more complicated. The  conventional assumption that high turnover is del  eterious cannot simply be replaced by a universal  optimal turnover level, since this level depends on  circumstances. It would therefore be wise to work  at least with a motivated threshold value (specific  for a firm or industry) that indicates from which  point onwards turnover can be considered as a  negative indicator.  For everyday practice, HR managers should have  an idea what the optimal rate of turnover is for their  organization. In addition, however, they should be  aware that this optimal rate can be influenced. In  the spirit of Abelson and Baysinger, they can imag  ine a long list of factors that are likely to influence  turnover and retention costs. As some of these fac  tors are clearly within the scope of company policy,  managers can act to reduce these costs, thereby  softening the trade-off between flexibility and com  mitment. To find out more about this, researchers  should give priority to specifying the relationship  between turnover and performance with regard to  type of HR policy.  More specifically, the question whether some  types of HR policy are more vulnerable to turnover  than others must be asked. We think the answer  should be yes, as traditional "Tayloristic" practices  have always been inspired by the aim of immuniz  ing firms against worker mobility. In the present era  of "high-commitment HRM," firms may still fall  back on forms of standardization that reduce re  placement costs; or, alternatively, they may try to  devise the least expensive ways to retain their valu  able employees. The upshot of all this is that HR  policy should not only be directed at the level of  turnover, but also at the effects of turnover. Job  design, training policies, skills portfolios, and the  development of distinctive competencies all relate  to these turnover effects. If this conjecture is cor  rect, it will take our topic into the realms of busi  ness strategy and strategic human resource manage  ment.  The fact that the analysis proved possible with  data stemming from just one company is very en  couraging. Perhaps the necessary research agenda  can now be fully realized. Of course, the cultural  and structural characteristics of our temp agency,  with its many offices producing the same product  under similar conditions, offered an almost ideal  starting point for our research. An analysis like  ours should also be feasible in less ideal circum  stances, provided sufficiently appropriate control  variables can be found. Computerized personnel  files make these company records increasingly ac  cessible, and their analysis is a practical alternative  to costly survey research and multivariate bench  marking.
