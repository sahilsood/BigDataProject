Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 Competencies and Imitability in the Pharmaceutical Industry: An Analysis of Their Relationship with Firm Performance ∗ Donna Marie De Carolis Management Department, LeBow College of Business, Drexel University, 32nd & Chestnut Sts., Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA Received 5 March 2000; received in revised form 7 May 2001; accepted 24 February 2002 Two research questions are addressed in this article. First, does technological competence enhance ﬁrm performance. Second, does competitor imitation of ﬁrm knowledge hurt perfor- mance. The relationships between technological competence, imitability and performance are basic premises in the resource-based view, yet there has been little empirical testing of them. Measures of technological competence and imitability are developed. These variables, together with measures of marketing and regulatory competence, are tested for their impact on ﬁrm per- formance in the pharmaceutical industry. Imitability has a negative and signiﬁcant impact on accounting and market-based performance measures. Contrary to expectations, technological competence is inversely related to market-based performance measures and positively related to accounting measures. Research and managerial implications for the ﬁndings are discussed. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved. When it comes to core competencies, it is difﬁcult to get off the train, walk to the next station, and then reboard. –Prahalad and Hamel (1990: 85) This quote from the article by Prahalad and Hamel succinctly allegorizes the relation- ship between organizational knowledge and core competencies. Core competencies are the embodiment of organizational knowledge, built up over time and not easily imitated (Leonard-Barton, 1995; Prahalad & Hamel, 1990) that yield a competitive advantage. Core competencies represent an accumulation of knowledge as organizations learn, actualize that learning in competencies, and deploy those competencies in their product–market ∗ Tel.: +1-215-895-1795; fax: +1-215-895-2891.

Competencies are typically so embedded in an organization that to acquire a different “bundle” of competencies entails a signiﬁcant investment in terms of resources, such as capital, people, and managerial vision—hence, the virtual impossibility of “boarding the next train.” This is particularly true with respect to ﬁrms whose competencies are technologically based, competing on the basis of a technological advantage as opposed to competing on the basis of marketing adeptness, distribution access or ownership of natural resources. Developing and sustaining technological competencies is important to continuous innova- tion in these ﬁrms. Many recent perspectives of ﬁrm behavior such as the resource-based view (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984), dynamics capabilities (Teece, Pisano & Shuen, 1997) and knowledge-based view (Kogut & Zander, 1992) suggest that ﬁrm competen- cies are stocks of knowledge (De Carolis & Deeds, 1999; Dierickx & Cool, 1989; Lev & Sougiannis, 1999) accumulated over time, difﬁcult for competitors to replicate, and are the source of competitive advantage (Barney, 1991; Dierickx & Cool, 1989; Reed & DeFillippi, 1990; Wernerfelt, 1984). A related stream of literature proposes that core competencies can become core rigidities (Leonard-Barton, 1995). Core rigidities are the opposite of core competencies; they are strengths that evolve into weaknesses. A technological competence may become a liability if it prevents the ﬁrm from expanding outside a particular knowledge trajectory to sustain competitive advantage. Core rigidities prevent new competencies from being developed or from maintaining the right balance of competencies. For core competencies to yield a competitive advantage, they must be inimitable—costly or difﬁcult for competitors to imitate. Barney (2001) stresses that imitability is the most important concept to emerge from the resource-based view. Imitability explains competitive advantage in equilibrium and this is what is most new about the resource-based view. Barney (2001) further claims that the empirical assertions derived from this concept are “. . . likely to be among the most important to come out of resource-based theory” (Barney, 2001: 45). However, there has been little empirical research on the construct of imitability. This article investigates two related research questions motivated by the resource-based view. First, do technological competencies make a difference in ﬁrm performance and, second, does competitor imitation of technological competencies hurt a given ﬁrm’s per- formance. A ﬁrm’s performance, even in technologically intensive industries, does not rely solely on technological expertise. Competencies in areas such as marketing, general man- agement, human resource management, and dealing effectively with external stakeholders and government entities may be critical to competitive advantage (Prahalad & Hamel, 1990). To address these questions, hypotheses are developed, based on the resource-based view of the ﬁrm, about the relationship between competencies, imitability and performance and tested in the pharmaceutical industry. This article makes several contributions to the growing literature on competencies and the resource-based view of the ﬁrm. First, addressing a gap in previous studies, this arti- cle investigates the impact of three different types of competencies on ﬁrm performance. This extension of previous empirical work was recently suggested by Lev and Sougiannis (1999) who call for examination of the performance implications of various assets such as marketing related competencies. Second, this paper develops a measure of technological competence that captures building on prior knowledge. This adds to the growing literature D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 29 on measuring stocks of knowledge (see for example Cockburn & Griliches, 1988; Hall, Jaffe & Trajtenberg, 2000; Lev & Sougiannis, 1999). Third, although the concept of imitability is central to the resource-based perspective, again, a review of the empirical literature in this area reveals that this construct has not been operationalized nor has its relationship with ﬁrm performance been assessed. Fourth, I empirically examine the impact of competencies on accounting and market-based measures of ﬁrm performance, again addressing a gap in the resource-based literature. Finally, the empirical analysis is based on longitudinal data and this type of dynamic research wherein the conditions under which competencies are developed under one period have implications for subsequent periods is appropriate for examining resource-based theory (Barney, 2001). The article begins with a brief exposition of the role of competencies and imitability in the context of the pharmaceutical industry. This is followed by the development of the model and hypothesis. The following sections describe the methodology, the data, and the construction of the variables. The paper then turns to a description of the results and closes with a discussion of their strategic implications for managers and suggestions for future research. Competencies and Competitive Advantage The term “competence” as used in the management literature generally conveys the notion that a ﬁrm possesses a degree of expertise and excellence in one or more particular areas compared to its competitors that results in a competitive advantage. In the numerous articles on competencies that have appeared in the past 20 years or so, the particular nomenclature for the “resources that yield competitive advantage” has varied greatly. Probably the term used most frequently is “core competence,” popularized by Prahalad and Hamel (1990). A review of the literature reveals that several concepts have emerged in lieu of or in addition to the term core competence or competence. The most commonly used terms are: resources, strategic assets, competencies, core competencies, capabilities, and core capabilities. Table 1 outlines these terms and the various authors that have used them. This table reveals that early deﬁnitions of competence were somewhat general in nature. The term has evolved into a richer concept that explains “how” ﬁrms do things better. The table also illustrates how some of the same terms are used to describe different ideas. I use the term competence as distinct from capabilities, concurring with the differences noted by Henderson and Cockburn (1994) and Leonard-Barton (1992). In this article the term competence is used to denote the local abilities, knowledge and skills and technical systems of a ﬁrm that may yield a competitive advantage. A review of the empirical studies in the competence literature reveal two gaps in the literature that are addressed in this article. First, competence is measured in various ways by different researchers. Competence has been operationalized by survey instruments of ex- cellence in functional areas (Hitt & Ireland, 1985; Hitt, Ireland & Palia, 1982; Hitt, Ireland & Stadter, 1982; Snow & Hrebiniak, 1980); by using ﬁnancial measures of intensity such as the ratio of research and development to sales, advertising to sales and administrative intensity (Chatterjee & Wernerfelt, 1991; Harrison, Hitt, Hoskisson & Ireland, 1991); by re- latedness among business units (Markides & Williamson, 1996; Robins & Wiersema, 1995); Table 1 Overview of deﬁnitions relating to competencies in the management literature Author(s) Selznick (1957) Andrews (1971) Snow and Hrebiniak (1980) Wernerfelt (1984) Dierickx and Cool (1989) Prahalad and Hamel (1990) Barney (1991) Grant (1991) Resources Strategic assets Competencies Core competences Capabilities Core capabilities [Distinctive] those things that an organization does well in comparison to competitors [Distinctive] the set of things an organization does especially well in comparison to its competitors [Distinctive] “. . . an aggregate of numerous speciﬁc activities that the organization tends to perform better than other organizations . . . ” (p. 317) “. . . anything which be thought of as a strength or weakness of the ﬁrm.” (p. 172) could “Critical or strategic asset stocks are those assets which are nontradeable . . . nonimitable and nonsubstitutable.” (p. 1507) “. . . all assets, capabilities, organi- zational processes, ﬁrm attributes, information, knowledge, etc. con- trolled by the ﬁrm that enable the ﬁrm to conceive of and implement strategies that improve its efﬁciency and effectiveness.” (p. 101) “. . . inputs into the production process . . . on their own, few resources are productive.” (p. 119) “. . . the collective learning in the organization . . . how to coordinate diverse production skills & integrate multiple streams of technology.” (p. 82) “. . . the capacity for a team of resources to perform some task or activity . . . the main source of [a ﬁrm’s] competitive advantage.” (p. 119) 3 0 .

De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 and by property based vs. knowledge-based resources (Miller & Shamsie, 1996). However, few studies (Henderson & Cockburn, 1994) speciﬁcally measure technological competence as building on a ﬁrm’s stock of knowledge. Second, relatively few studies have actually tested the relationship between different com- petencies and ﬁnancial performance. This is due in large part to deﬁnitional and operational issues. There exist many deﬁnitions of competence representing different levels of analysis. Moreover, it is difﬁcult to measure competencies on an aggregate level. Some scholars have used the case study approach to document the link between competencies and competitive advantage (Collis, 1991; Leonard-Barton, 1992). Henderson and Cockburn (1994) studied the relationship among competencies and research productivity. Chatterjee and Wernerfelt (1991) examined the link between resource proﬁles and diversiﬁcation types. Thus, there appears a gap in the literature on actually measuring the direct impact of speciﬁc compe- tencies such as technological, regulatory and marketing on ﬁrm performance. One of the purposes of this investigation is to ﬁll that gap and empirically investigate the impact of speciﬁc competencies on ﬁrm performance. Competencies and Imitability in the Pharmaceutical Industry The context of the pharmaceutical industry provides an appropriate domain for this study since it is a technologically dynamic industry. Discovery of new drugs and their success- ful commercialization drive performance. Three types of competencies are valuable in this industry: technological, marketing and regulatory (Bogner & Thomas, 1994). The value of a ﬁrm’s resources is determined by the context of the speciﬁc market in which it is operating. This makes the value component of the resource-based view exogenously de- termined (Barney, 2001; Priem & Butler, 2001). Technological, marketing and regulatory competencies are valuable in the context of the pharmaceutical industry (Bogner & Thomas, 1994; Cool & Schendel, 1988; Henderson & Cockburn, 1994, 1988; Hill & Hansen, 1991; Thomas, 1990). Technological competencies in pharmaceuticals are a function of expertise in scientiﬁc discipline and therapeutic area. The traditional scientiﬁc knowledge base for pharmaceuti- cal companies has been organic chemistry and pharmacology. However, biotechnology is affecting the technology of drug research and the capabilities of established pharmaceutical companies since its knowledge bases are found in genetics, molecular biology and protein chemistry (Pisano, 1997). Research skills in pharmaceuticals are interpreted relative to the various therapeutic classes of drugs that exist (Bogner & Thomas, 1994). Pharmaceutical ﬁrms have gener- ally pursued capabilities in particular therapeutic areas so as to become experts in certain ﬁelds. One of the factors contributing to this drive for competence in speciﬁc areas is that the preponderance of relatively “easy” pharmacological discoveries has already been made (Economist, 1997; Langreth, 1995; Tanouye & Langreth, 1997). It is becoming more difﬁ- cult for pharmaceutical companies to ﬁnd entirely new drugs. During the 1960s and 1970s there were many breakthrough medicines to treat heart disease, depression, arthritis and other diseases. New Drug Applications to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) peaked in 1983 to 270 from 120 in 1978. Subsequently, new discoveries became harder to ﬁnd D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 33 as evidenced by the decline in New Drug Applications—86 in 1993 (Economist, 1997; Langreth, 1995; Tanouye & Langreth, 1997). On the other hand, pursing new products in one therapeutic area can enhance learning in other areas. Allen, Lee and Tushman (1980) and Katz (1988) suggest that in technology- driven environments intra-organizational learning enhances research performance. Henderson and Cockburn (1994) also ﬁnd that a ﬂow of information across the bound- aries of the ﬁrm is related to research productivity. Moreover, a strategy of strictly pursing certain therapeutic classes could be too limiting and most ﬁrms look into other therapeutic areas to develop competencies and broader pipelines or portfolios of potential drugs. The durability of a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage is partly a function of how successfully other ﬁrms are able to imitate the focal ﬁrm’s technological competence. Unsuccessful imitation does not erode the focal ﬁrm’s competitive advantage. However, when a ﬁrm’s technological competencies are being imitated, then competitive advantage will not last long. This is certainly true in many industries and perhaps is even more critical in the pharmaceutical industry. Research and development costs in this industry are somewhere between US$400 and US$500 million dollars and it takes approximately 10 years to bring a drug to market (MedAd News, 1999). Pharmaceutical companies patent a new chemical entity at the time of discovery affording them some protection. By the time the development process is completed and FDA approval is achieved, a signiﬁcant portion of the patent protection is gone. This has important implications for innovation in this industry. Once a patent is granted, the knowledge contained in that patent is public. This reinforces the fact that learning must be ongoing, as imitation will eventually erode ﬁrm speciﬁc innovation. Therefore, new learning even in the same areas is critical for survival. Effectively dealing with the FDA is another valuable resource. The approval process for new drugs is costly and lengthy. The ﬁnal submission of the New Drug Application (NDA) averages about 50,000 pages. The review process can take anywhere from several months to several years. (There is an exception in the case of “high priority drugs” such as cancer or AIDS treatments that are usually approved/disapproved within 12 or so months.) Finally, pharmaceutical companies need to effectively market their new products. The success of some drugs, particularly those in the same category such as high blood pressure drugs, depends on how well a company can differentiate that drug particularly to physicians. The market share and revenues of a particular drug depend in large part on a strong and edu- cated marketing and sales team. Thus, the context of pharmaceuticals provides a rich arena in which to examine the effect of technological, marketing and regulatory competencies on ﬁrm performance. Theoretical Model and Hypotheses Technological Competence and Firm Performance The premise that unique ﬁrm capabilities are critical to ﬁrm performance has been ad- dressed in many streams of literature: resource-based models of ﬁrm behavior (Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984) organizational learning theories (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990; Fiol & Lyles, 1985); knowledge-based perspectives of the ﬁrm; (Kogut & Zander, 1992) evolutionary 34 D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 economics (Nelson & Winter, 1982) and the dynamic capabilities perspective (Teece et al., 1997). A natural trajectory of knowledge is embedded in a ﬁrm’s competencies. Knowledge has been deﬁned as the creation and organization of information, based on the commitments and beliefs of its holder (Nonaka, 1994). This explanation of knowledge is consistent with the notion that ﬁrms operate within certain technological paradigms (Dosi, 1982). Most innovations are not radical or discontinuous in the sense that they make obsolete existing organizational capabilities (Tushman & Anderson, 1986). Radical innovations are based on new science and create new markets. Most innovations are incremental in nature, building on already existing ﬁrm knowledge. Incremental innovations involve the adaptation, reﬁnement and enhancement of existing products, services and/or production processes. Firms typically compete with incremental innovations and will increase their learning and knowledge in that particular technological dominant design. Technological competencies consist of knowledge and skills embedded in people and knowledge embedded in technical systems (Leonard-Barton, 1995). Technical systems are the manifestations of years of accumulating, codifying and structuring the tacit knowledge embodied in people. These competencies can become institutionalized. That is, they are part of organizational assumptions that guide strategic decision-making. Technology embedded in technical systems and people skills typically can be traced back to the ﬁrm’s ﬁrst products or services. Dominant logic (Bettis & Prahalad, 1986) refers to the general management mindset that pervades the ﬁrm by producing a world-view governing decision-making pro- cesses and strategies. This dominant logic is also applicable to organizational knowledge as deﬁned above. In the pharmaceutical industry, ﬁrms usually develop an expertise in both scientiﬁc and therapeutic areas. Advances and learning in both areas are critical in new drug discovery and development (Henderson & Cockburn, 1994). Specialized learning over time reinforces the competencies and patterns of interactions that bear successful solutions. Firms may learn and develop technological competencies in many ways. As ﬁrms work in a particular technological regime, they innovate in the sense that knowledge is combined to create improvements in a product or incorporate new functions into a product. These incremental improvements may duplicate a competence or re-combine internal knowledge or incorporate either new internally developed knowledge or newly acquired external knowl- edge into the existing product. A ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity, the learning that occurs through absorption of external knowledge (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990) is a critical concept in un- derstanding competence building. Firms may acquire external knowledge and apply this knowledge to their own understanding. Cohen and Levinthal (1990) also emphasize that ﬁrms absorb and incorporate new knowledge that is related to their existing knowledge bases. The re-combining of internal capabilities to produce new knowledge is a central focus in the knowledge-based theory of the ﬁrm (Kogut & Zander, 1992). The creation of technological competencies is theoretically linked to competitive advan- tage (Barney, 2001; Prahalad & Hamel, 1990; Leonard-Barton, 1995). In particular, many studies address the importance of unique technological competencies to be strategically signiﬁcant in science and technology-driven industries (Dierickx & Cool, 1989; Henderson & Cockburn, 1994). D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 35 There does exist a downside to building on ﬁrm knowledge, what Leonard-Barton (1992) calls “core rigidities.” Core rigidities may result from the institutionalization of knowledge and routines so that new concepts and technologies are not taken seriously. Firms see only their competencies as being valuable and do not consider alternative innovations as having commercialization possibility. Yet, accumulated ﬁrm knowledge is the prime ingredient in technological competence as ﬁrms operate in particular technological paradigms. The manifestation of technological competencies is the ability of ﬁrms to become “experts” in what they do through the enhancement over time of organizational knowledge. The building of stocks of knowledge leads to the development of competencies. Hypothesis 1: There will be a positive relationship between technological competence and ﬁrm performance. Imitability and Firm Performance Imitability refers to the extent to which rivals can imitate a competence. The construct of imitability has received the most theoretical attention by scholars (Dierickx & Cool, 1989; Reed & DeFillippi, 1990) and the empirical assertions derived from this concept (Barney, 2001) are likely to be among the most important emanating from the resource-based view. This is due to its theoretical relationship with sustained competitive advantage. Of course, competitive advantage can be sustained in many ways and under different conditions (Reed & DeFillippi, 1990). Such a theoretical and empirical undertaking is beyond the scope of this paper. Yet, the discussion of the role of imitability in competitive advantage is well delineated in the literature and, as such, is central to the discussion of competitive advantage. A ﬁrm’s technological competencies may be inimitable (Barney, 1991; Prahalad & Hamel, 1990; Wernerfelt, 1984) and may be disseminated in a variety of ways. Levin et al. (1984) identiﬁed several methods of spillover: patent disclosures, publications, technical meetings, conversations between employees of competing ﬁrms, hiring of employees from rival ﬁrms, and reverse engineering of products. With respect to patents, there are numerous articles that support the notion that the value of the knowledge contained in patents does spill over to other ﬁrms who cite those patents. The theoretical and empirical literature in the innovation area suggests that patent citations are in fact a form of knowledge spillover (Trajtenberg, 1990). This literature also suggests that highly cited patents are the most in- novative as other ﬁrms are vying to imitate their ideas (Carpenter & Narin, 1983; Narin, Rose & Olivastro, 1989; Trajtenberg, 1990). However, there is little literature on the effect of this imitation on the “cited” ﬁrm. In other words, if the originator of a valuable innovation is being imitated (in the case of patents, “cited”), then there should be a detrimental effect on the ﬁrm’s competitive advan- tage. Rival ﬁrms are appropriating their knowledge and their commercial success from that knowledge. In the pharmaceutical industry, knowledge spillovers may be beneﬁcial to research pro- ductivity. Henderson and Cockburn (1996) suggest that knowledge spillovers produce a positive effect on research productivity if the knowledge is complementary. However, when rival research efforts are substitutes, there would be a negative effect on research produc- 36 D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 tivity. Moreover, even though pharmaceutical companies can license their patents to other ﬁrms, they receive no income when other ﬁrms cite their patents in subsequent patents. Appropriability—the ability of a ﬁrm to capture the proﬁts generated by an innovation— is inﬂuenced by legal mechanisms such as patents, copyrights and trade secrets and also by the nature of the underlying technology, that is, the extent to which knowledge is tacit or codiﬁed (Teece, 1986). If an innovation is easily imitated, then a ﬁrm may not be able to appropriate the returns from that innovation. A weak appropriability regime (Teece, 1986) lessens the chances that an innovator will proﬁt from an innovation. In pharmaceuticals the long lead-time between the patenting of a new molecular entity and its ﬁnal commercialization can result in patent expiration before the commercialization (Pisano, 1997). Moreover, this lead-time may be even shorter in that once a patent is issued, the information becomes public knowledge. Rival ﬁrms have the opportunity to circumvent issued patents and imitate the knowledge generated in those innovations. Thus, it should be true that if a ﬁrm’s knowledge is imitated, its performance will diminish. Hypothesis 2: Imitability of ﬁrm knowledge has an inverse relationship with ﬁrm per- formance. Marketing Competencies and Firm Performance As mentioned above, ﬁrms may possess several types of competencies. Conceptually, a marketing competence refers to a ﬁrm’s ability to develop and maintain relationships with customers, the ability to use market intelligence about external factors that might in- ﬂuence current and future customer needs and also the quality of channel relationships (Mooreman & Slotegraaf, 1999). Marketing competencies are proposed to be just as im- portant to ﬁrm performance (Cool & Schendel, 1987). Current marketing literature, based on resource-based theory, suggests that a ﬁrm’s marketing competency will have a direct inﬂuence on performance (Day, 1994; Hunt & Morgan, 1995; Mooreman & Slotegraaf, 1999). In the pharmaceutical industry, the deployment of strong marketing capabilities impacts the success of new drugs. Pharmaceutical companies rely on highly trained sales forces to represent their products to doctors, health care systems and managed care networks. Phar- maceutical representatives are intensely trained so as to be knowledgeable about the drugs being promoted to their various customers. Pharmaceutical companies track the prescribing habits of individual physicians through pharmacies to obtain data on which physicians are prescribing particular drugs. A strong marketing competence can make a tremendous dif- ference in market share for drugs of the same type. Several studies have empirically linked the positive effects of advertising on ﬁrm performance (Chauvin & Hirschey, 1993; Jose, Nichols & Stevens, 1986; Lustgarten & Thomadkis, 1987; Morck, Shleifer & Vishny, 1988). In the management literature, the importance of resources such as marketing and innovative skills is closely linked to ﬁrm performance (Bettis, 1981; Chatterjee & Wernerfelt, 1991). Hypothesis 3: Marketing competencies have a positive relationship with ﬁrm performance. D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 37 Regulatory Competencies and Firm Performance Barney (1986) suggests that assets required to implement a strategy might be bought and sold in factor markets. As Dierickx and Cool (1989) point out, however, this is not true of all assets. Consider for example, the instance of corporate reputation, dealer loyalty or the ability to deal proﬁciently with governmental agencies. Dierickx and Cool (1989) suggest that assets such as these are nonappropriable. Their nonappropriability derives from many sources such as the absence of deﬁned property rights, loyalty or trust. These assets are built or accumulated over time. Firms will engage in a consistent pattern of activities over long periods of time to accumulate such competencies. As mentioned previously, throughout the drug development process, a pharmaceutical company must maintain constant communication with the FDA, which has oversight author- ity over the clinical trials, ﬁnal approval and manufacturing of any drugs. Pharmaceutical companies are required to ﬁle an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application with the FDA that must be approved prior to the commencement of clinical trials. They also need to prepare and ﬁle a (NDA) with the FDA for ﬁnal approval to manufacture and market a new drug. Pharmaceutical companies have entire staffs devoted to dealing with the FDA. Developing an expertise in the preparation and completion of the required documentation for the drug approval process and establishing a relationship with the FDA, is critical to product commercialization in the pharmaceutical industry (Cool & Schendel, 1988). These relationships and expertise in communicating with the FDA are attributable to the accumulation of expertise in this area, to time compression diseconomies (Dierickx & Cool, 1989), to tacit knowledge, to complexity and to asset speciﬁcity (Reed & DeFillippi, 1990). There exists a tremendous human component in maintaining a successful relationship with an external agency. It involves a degree of tacitness, that is, development by experience and practice that is hard to codify. It is characterized by complexity—consisting of large numbers of organizational routines and individual or team based experiences. A regulatory competence is necessary to maintain harmonious relationships with governmental agencies (Hitt & Ireland, 1985). Thus, in addition to technological knowledge and marketing compe- tencies, a proﬁciency in documentation and ﬁling for the FDA and a working relationship with this agency is an important competency in the pharmaceutical industry. Hypothesis 4: Regulatory competencies have a positive relationship with ﬁrm perfor- mance. Measuring Technological Competence and Imitability Technological competence involves building a stock of knowledge. Most of the previous research that has attempted to measure technological competence has been case study or anecdotal evidence (Bogner & Thomas, 1994; Collis, 1991; Grant, 1991; Leonard-Barton, 1992; Prahalad & Hamel, 1990). New measures of technological competence and imitability are advanced using a variation of patent citation analysis. Before the actual measure used is described, the general technique of patent citation analysis is explained. 38 D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 Patent citations are references delineated on the front page of every patent that refer to prior patents. Every new patent relies on knowledge developed in past patents, much in the same way that advances in management literature cites previous research. When ﬁrms develop new inventions and patent these inventions, they will cite prior “state of the art.” The front page of a patent contains demographic information as well as a section titled “References Cited.” In this section, prior patents that provided the knowledge relied on for the current patent are listed. Citation analysis involves the selection of certain patents and then scrutinizing subsequent patents to assess how many times they are cited. Patent citations are worthy indicators of technological competence for two reasons. First, they are objective. Patent citations are not quoted at the whim of the inventor. The patent examiner, together with the inventor and the inventor’s attorney, arrive at a ﬁnal list of citations for every patent and this list limits the scope of property rights of the patent owner and is protected by law. Thus, there is an incentive for all parties to cite the relevant state of the art (Campbell & Nieves, 1979; Trajtenberg, 1990). Second, patent citations are indicators of valuable technological knowledge. A patent that is highly cited is one that is regarded as having greater than average impact. Clearly, patent citation analysis is an improvement over simple patent counts that do not capture the quality of a patent. Other studies (Carpenter & Narin, 1983; Narin et al., 1989; Trajtenberg, 1990) empirically establish the validity of patent citation analysis as indicators of technological competence. In a recent study, Hall et al. (2000) ﬁnd that citation weighted patent stocks are more highly correlated with market value than stocks of patents themselves. Self-citation Analysis Earlier works have measured stocks of knowledge and have operationalized the stock of knowledge with patent data (De Carolis & Deeds, 1999; Henderson & Cockburn, 1994, 1996). Patents are one manifestation of ﬁrm knowledge. The learning that occurs to pro- duce the innovation contained in the patent—whether that learning be acquired through combining existing internal knowledge or combining existing internal knowledge with new internal knowledge—is represented on that patent. Patents embody stocks of accumulated knowledge—not just from 1 or 2 years but also from many years. Extending these prior empirical applications, this study suggests that a ﬁrm’s ability to build on its knowledge is manifested by the frequency with which it cites its own inventive activities on its issued patents. In the present study, this is measured using a variation of patent citation analysis that is identiﬁed as “self-citation analysis.” That is, a ﬁrm’s refer- ences to its prior patents on its subsequent patents are representative of building knowl- edge stocks. This approach is analogous to bibliographic author counts that are indicators of how frequently researchers in the natural and social sciences are quoted. Researchers who cite their past work, build knowledge within particular areas and become experts in those areas. This same reasoning is applied to patent references. Thus, the method used in this study to represent a ﬁrm’s stock of knowledge is patent self-citation analy- sis. Similarly, imitability may be measured by assessing how frequently other companies cite a particular ﬁrm’s knowledge, again obtained from patent data. It is expected that the value of a ﬁrm’s knowledge is diluted as more and more companies try to mimic that knowledge. D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 39 Methodology In addition to the reasons discussed above for choosing the pharmaceutical industry as the domain of this study, testing the model is tested in a single industry over multiple points in time rather than in multiple industries controls for industry effects. Patent data was obtained from Computer Horizons Inc. (CHI) and the sample consists of 14 pharmaceutical companies that represent major global ﬁrms, were in the top 40 of annual US pharmaceutical sales in at least one of the sampled years and have been used extensively in previous research. These companies are: Abbott Labs, American Home Products, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Glaxo, Johnson and Johnson, Merck, Monsanto, Pﬁzer, Schering-Plough, Smith Kline Beecham, Syntex, Upjohn and Warner Lambert. Measures Descriptions of the measures used for the independent and dependent variables are given below. Measures for technological competence and imitability, are derived from a patent database developed by CHI. The database obtained by this author included selected infor- mation on patents and patent citations for each of the pharmaceutical companies for the years 1985–1991. Technological competence (Techcomp). This variable is calculated as follows: Company A had issued “N” number of patents during a given year. Within 2 years of their issue date, “M” patents had cited these “N” patents. Of these “M” citations, “X” patents belonged to Company A—self-citing. The ratio of X/N is the measure used for technological competence. Imitability (Imitability). Similar to the self-cite measure, this was calculated as follows: Company A had issued “N” number of patents during a given year. Within 2 years of their issue date, “M” patents had cited these “N” patents. Of these “M” citations, “Y” patents were by other companies. The ratio of Y/N is the measure used for Imitability. Marketing competence (Ad/Sales). Relative advertising expenditures is used measured as the total advertising expenditures divided by total sales for a given year. This information was obtained from Compustat. Previous studies have utilized levels of spending intensity as proxies for marketing skills (Bettis, 1981; Chatterjee & Wernerfelt, 1991; Lecraw, 1984). Regulatory competency (Approval). This construct is operationalized as the number of new drugs per year per ﬁrm. Pharmaceutical companies may develop a reputation for dealing effectively with the FDA. This expertise should be reﬂected in the amount of new drug approvals per year. New drugs categorized as Type A drugs or high priority drugs were used as the basis for this measure. Type A drugs as deﬁned by the FDA Pink Sheets, represent totally new chemical entities; thus they embody the culmination of the ﬁrm’s developing knowledge. Research and development expenditures (RD/Sales). Research and development expen- ditures have been used as a proxy for innovation, competence or technological strength 40 D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 (Hill & Snell, 1988; Jensen, 1987). The assumption is that more funds committed to R&D the more chances a ﬁrm has to be innovative. An alternative view (Grabowski & Vernon, 1990; Graves & Langowitz, 1993; McClean & Round, 1978; Scherer, 1965) suggests that increased R&D expenditures in fact lead to a decline in innovation. Given the inconsistent results of prior research on the effects of research and development on ﬁrm performance (Henderson & Cockburn, 1996) it is included as a control variable here. It is measured as the ratio of research and development expenditures to total sales and data was obtained from Compustat. Size (Assets). The size of the pharmaceutical company measured as total assets is in- cluded as a control variable. All data was obtained from Compustat. Total number of patents (Patents). This variable, measured, as the total number of patents granted to a pharmaceutical company per year, is included as a control variable. Single patent counts have correlated with innovativeness in prior empirical studies. Firm age (Age). Sorensen and Stuart (2000) found that age had implications for innova- tive activities for ﬁrms. Speciﬁcally, they found that the tendency of a ﬁrm to cite their own patents increases with ﬁrm age. In this study, conﬁned to one industry, most of the ﬁrms will be of relatively similar age. However, ﬁrm age is included as a control variable here, acknowledging the effect found by Sorensen and Stuart (2000). Performance (ROA & MKBK). Performance is measured using return on assets (ROA) and market to book value (MB). There are several reasons for using both measures. First, proﬁtability measures are frequently used in the strategy literature. Previous research in the resource-based view has also empirically examined proﬁtability measures as a function of competencies (Bierly & Chakrabarati, 1996; Harrison et al., 1991; Markides & Williamson, 1994, 1996). This investigation is also part of the patents-performance literature that spans the disci- plines of strategy, economics and ﬁnance. Within these streams, many studies have explored the relationship between innovation and market value using patent data (Deng, Lev & Narin, 1999; Hausman, Hall & Griliches, 1984; Hall, 1998; Hall et al., 2000). In the tradition of these literatures, market to book value is also used a performance measure. Market to book values captures the market valuation of a ﬁrm’s total assets, both tangible and intangible, relative to an accounting valuation—the book value of assets. Market to book captures fu- ture economic returns whereas return on assets captures current returns (Mueller, 1990). Compustat is the source for both performance measures. Analysis Since the data covers 7 years, this study employs a time-series cross sectional regression analysis. The particular technique used is TSCS REG found in SAS. The model under investigation consists of observations of the same units several times and the observations may not be statistically independent. The biases associated with this speciﬁcation are serial and contemporaneous correlation of the residuals and heteroskedasticity. The modiﬁed GLS D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 41 estimation technique by Parks (1967) takes into account three sources of bias under these assumptions. The ﬁrst is serial correlation which assumes that the error terms within cross sections are more highly correlated in years 1 and 2 than in years 1 and 7. The second bias is heteroskedasticity that occurs when the residuals do not have a common variance. The third is contemporaneous correlation. The Parks method corrects for all of these biases. This particular type of time-series cross sectional analysis has been performed in other management studies (Mizruchi & Stearns, 1988; Stearns & Mizruchi, 1993). The analysis is performed using models with no lag between the independent and depen- dent variables and with a 1-year lag to account for any lagged effects of speciﬁc competen- cies and imitation activity on ﬁrm performance. Conceptually, the independent variables represent a ﬁrm’s stock of competencies and similarly, the variable imitability is capturing the cumulative imitation of technological competence. On the other hand, there may also be lagged effects so that accumulated competencies affect performance in future periods. Other studies in this area have shown lagged effects (Deng et al., 1999; Hausman et al., 1984). Results Concerning the patent citation analysis, Table 2 shows the breakdown of the citations into within sample and outside of the sample. The sample includes a total of 4198 patents. One thousand six hundred and eight of those patents are self-cites within the group. Two thousand two hundred and ﬁfty-three are cites from outside the sample. The average patent activity for the sample is 97 patents. Descriptive statistics and the correlation analysis are presented in Table 3. Techncomp and Imitability were standardized. A t-test was performed to check for differences of the means between technological competence and imitability. The test was signiﬁcant at the .001 level. It should be noted that citations begin to decline during the last year because in some cases, citations are made to these patents after 1991. This should be kept in mind when interpreting the regression results (Hall, 1998). The results of the correlation analysis show no problems of multicollinearity among the independent variables. As would be expected there is a signiﬁcant positive correlation between Assets and Patents suggesting that larger ﬁrms engage in more patenting activity. The positive and signiﬁcant correlation between Age and Assets further implies that older ﬁrms are larger in size. Patents are negatively correlated with RD/Sales, suggesting that more research and development dollars do not necessarily result in increased patenting Table 2 Breakdown of patent citations Within sample Outside sample Self-cites Cites from others 1608 0 1608 337 2253 2590 Total 1945 2253 4198 Table 3 Descriptive statistic and correlation analysis Mean S.D. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 13.634 5.399 .000002 −.000001 .069 .847 .096 5219.000 100.286 96.571 5.76 3.41 .95 .97 .06 .91 .03 2418.00 50.07 30.07 1.000 .421*** .075 −.092* −.130 .200 .200 −.101 −.117 −.097 1.000 −.128 −.218* −.013 .118 .150 .037‘ .007 .095 1.000 .245 .316** −.171 −.140 −.208 −.056 −.072 1.000 −.006 −.069 −.120 −.115 −.012 −.053 1.000 −.020 −.363*** −.343*** .167 −.375*** 1.000 .029 .192 .260* .025 1.000 −.230 .414*** −.131 1.000 .596*** .436*** 1.00 .137 1.00 Variable 1.

Ad/Sales has a negative relationship with age, assets and RD/Sales. This implies that older and larger ﬁrms spend less on advertising and sales. The inverse relationship among AD/Sales and RD/Sales suggests that ﬁrms that spend more on research and development spend less on advertising. Table 4 shows the regression results for four models. Using ROA as the dependent vari- able, there are consistent results across both models for Techcomp and Imitability. Support- ing Hypothesis 1, Techcomp is positive and signiﬁcant. Imitability is negative and signiﬁ- cant supporting Hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 3 is not supported as Ad/Sales is not signiﬁcant. Hypothesis 4 is supported in the lagged model as Approval is positive and signiﬁcant. Of the control variables, Assets and RD/Sales are positive and signiﬁcant in Models 1 and 2. Age is negative and signiﬁcant in the lagged model. Models 3 and 4 show the regression results with MKBK as the dependent variable. Con- trary to Models 1 and 2, there are different results, particularly with Techcomp. In Model 3, there is no relationship between Techcomp and MKBK. However, in Model 4, there is a neg- ative and signiﬁcant relationship between Techcomp and MKBK suggesting that building on ﬁrm speciﬁc knowledge adversely affects future cash ﬂows. In support of Hypothesis 2 and consistent with the results found in Models 1 and 2, Imitability is negative and signiﬁcant with MKBK. AD/Sales is positive and signiﬁcant in both models supporting Hypothesis 3. Hypothesis 4 is also supported as Approval is positive and signiﬁcant. With respect to the control variables, Assets is positive and signiﬁcant in both Models 3 and 4. RD/Sales is directly and signiﬁcantly related to MKBK only in Model 3. Finally, Patents is positive and signiﬁcant in both Models 3 and 4 skills in terms of preventing knowledge appropriation. Discussion Despite the theoretical support for a relationship among technological competence and performance, the empirical results in this study are conﬂicting. Technological competence has a positive impact on return on assets and a negative effect on market to book value in the lagged model. Return on assets is a return on investment measure. These results suggest 44 D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 that in the short term, building on prior stocks of knowledge may be a superior strategy. However, future cash ﬂows, as evidenced by market to book value, do not beneﬁt from a strategy of building on ﬁrm knowledge stocks. What accounts for this unpredicted ﬁnding? Building on ﬁrm speciﬁc knowledge could indicate the development of core rigidities (Leonard-Barton, 1995) and the market sees this as a shortcoming. The implication is that relying on the same competencies (as well as the self-citations demanded by such reliance) rather than developing new competencies is dam- aging to ﬁrm performance. This could lead to ignoring external developments that may be crucial to future competitive advantage, particularly in environments characterized by rapid scientiﬁc and technological advances. These results not only highlight the controversy over appropriate performance measures in the strategy literature but also speak to the challenges facing managers when making strategic decisions. Building on ﬁrm speciﬁc knowledge may be proﬁtable in the short term but the market views does not view this strategy as the route to competitive advantage. Reliance on the same competencies will not carry the day in the future, as is evidenced by the inverse relationship between technological competence and market to book value. This may also be seen as “active inertia”—that is, the tendency of ﬁrm’s to persist in a current trajectory and continue established behavior patterns (Sull, 1999). Sull (1999) suggests that companies become stuck in modes of thinking and working that initially brought them success. When the environment changes, ﬁrms may be unable or incapable of adapting. The predicted negative relationship between imitability and ﬁrm performance was sup- ported in all models. This is quite a signiﬁcant result given the magnitude of the imitability concept in the resource-based view. These ﬁndings provide strong evidence that a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage can be diluted quickly as other ﬁrms draw from its technological knowledge. Marketing competence is positively and signiﬁcantly related to market to book value but not to return on assets. This implies that the development of marketing competencies is a necessary expense that does not immediately contribute to accounting returns but may in fact contribute to the future value of the ﬁrm. Regulatory competence is positive and signiﬁ- cant in all but one of the regression models afﬁrming the importance of cultivating effective relationships with governmental bodies. In the pharmaceutical industry, a regulatory com- petence is a valued asset that is developed over time and contributes to ﬁrm performance. The total number of patents is positive and signiﬁcant only in the market to book regression models. This ﬁnding is consistent with recent prior literature (Deng et al., 1999; Hall, 1998) on the relationship between patenting activity and market value. The ﬁeld of organizational ecology has addressed the repercussions of aging on organi- zational innovation, but there is no consensus in that literature as to whether these reper- cussions are positive or negative in terms of ﬁrm performance (Sorensen & Stuart, 2000). This analysis seems to suggest that the market is agnostic as to the age of the ﬁrm. Age is negative and signiﬁcant with ROA, implying that as ﬁrms get older, their return on their current investment shrinks. Finally, research and development intensity is directly related to performance in all but Model 4. As mentioned earlier, prior theoretical and empirical literature is inconsistent about the impact of research investment on organizational performance. To some extent, these results exhibit that same inconsistency. D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 45 Overall, these ﬁndings seem to suggest that competencies are better predictors of market measures of performance. This seems to square well with previous studies using patent data (Deng et al., 1999) and market measures of performance. It also implies that the market incorporates the affect of stocks of competencies—be it positive or negative—into its evaluation of future performance. Future Research In addition to the questions this study addresses, the results suggest several new directions for future research. This article used patent citation data to tease out the ex- tent to which ﬁrms built upon their own innovative activity. Future research might seek out other ways of measuring the phenomena of building on ﬁrm speciﬁc knowledge. For example, competencies could develop from a combination of internal and external learning, or the re-combining of internal knowledge, or from the acquisition of external knowledge. Incorporating measures that represent these different dimensions of techno- logical competence may increase our understanding technological competencies and their impact on ﬁrm performance. However, measuring ﬁrm knowledge building is a difﬁcult task. Another avenue of research is to explore the intriguing possibility that ﬁrms whose innovations have been imitated may in fact learn from the imitator. In other words, a ﬁrm may be able to enhance its knowledge by learning from what others have done in their attempts to imitate them. A scholarly examination of how imitation of knowledge may impact the originator of that knowledge would provide tremendous insights into the strategy, learning and technology areas. This study proposed a measure for imitability, a central construct in the resource-based view that is at the ﬁrm level and not been used before. The ﬁndings for the imitability measure are a ﬁrst step and should spur future research interest in both operationalizing this construct and examining its relationship to ﬁrm performance. Related to this, researchers could investigate how ﬁrms try to prevent imitation. Protecting knowledge from appropri- ation is a skill unto itself and examining the ways ﬁrms do this would be an interesting avenue of research. Another avenue for future research in this area is the generation of alternative measures for both marketing competence and regulatory competence. As marketing competence is strategically important not only for pharmaceuticals but for many industries, the creation of more reﬁned measures of this construct would be a great contribution to this area. Similarly, regulatory competence, the ability to deal effectively and successfully with government agencies, is a critical strategic competence in many industries. Through communicating and working with government agencies, companies gain a certain reputation for their adroitness or ineptness in this area. Incorporating the impact of reputation more directly into a measure of regulatory competence might shed more light on the relationship between regulatory competencies and ﬁrm performance. Finally, the fundamental issue of does innovation or day-to-day execution of business processes matter more for ﬁrm performance is highlighted in this study. In the market to book models, both execution variables, marketing and regulatory competence are directly related to ﬁrm performance, while in the ROA models, technological competence, not the 46 D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 other competence variables, directly inﬂuence performance. Future research could explore this possibility. Practical Implications These ﬁndings generate some interesting managerial implications. First, the results sug- gest that accumulation of ﬁrm speciﬁc knowledge does not always lead to a competitive advantage. In fact, these results actually suggest that reliance on the same competencies harms ﬁrm performance in the long run. In technologically dynamic industries, the acquisi- tion and incorporation of new knowledge is critical to both short and long term competitive advantage as evidenced by these ﬁndings. Companies are challenged to simultaneously learn how to exploit their current competencies while allocating resources to develop new ones. With respect to the pharmaceutical industry, the rapid advances in biotechnology necessitate quick learning of new competencies for established pharmaceutical ﬁrms. Second, and most challenging for the pharmaceutical industry, is the ﬁnding with respect to imitability. Being innovative is a double-edged sword in pharmaceuticals as patenting protects yet reveals knowledge. Despite the fact that knowledge building is critical, the imitation of ﬁrm knowledge can be detrimental. Competitors may imitate and approve upon innovations creating new knowledge, techniques and products. These ﬁndings underpin the managerial imperatives of (1) monitoring and incorporating technological developments; (2) continually generating innovations and (3) improving their skills in terms of preventing knowledge appropriation. Limitations These ﬁndings, their interpretation and my subsequent discussion must be considered in the context of the study’s limitations. This investigation focused on one industry and, as such, lacks generalizability. However, with a homogeneous sample, any industry disturbances are held constant for all ﬁrms. Deeper insight into the effects of competencies and imitability on ﬁrm performance would be obtained by examining these variables in different industries. The data covered only a selected time period. Longer time frames may shed more light on the robustness of the hypothesized relationships. In some cases, citations made to speciﬁc patents may decline in later years, as there is not enough time for them to be cited. This limitation should be recognized in interpreting the regression results. Moreover, the patent data used in this study has some limitations. First, I was unable to differentiate between product and process patents and also patent categories and there may exist systematic differences in patent citations among these different types of patents. The second limitation of this particular patent data set is the inability to identify licensed or acquired patents that have implications in terms of ﬁrm’s building on a stock of knowledge. Conclusion This article opened with a quote from Prahalad and Hamel (1990) in which they sug- gested that developing new competencies is no easy task—rather unlike simply getting off one train and sauntering onto another. Implicit in their analogy is the fact that accumulation D.M. De Carolis / Journal of Management 2003 29(1) 27–50 47 of expertise not only takes time to acquire, but it also takes time to transform. These empir- ical results highlight the jeopardy inherent in acquiring competencies and the importance of new learning. These empirical ﬁndings also provide evidence of the negative relation- ship between competitor imitation of knowledge and ﬁrm performance. Finally, the results suggest that ﬁrm performance is affected by other competencies, such as marketing and regulatory. It is hoped that the results presented here stimulate new resource-based research on the relationship between competencies, imitability and ﬁrm performance in other industry contexts.
