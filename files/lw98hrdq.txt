Human Resource Orientation and  Corporate Performance  Long W Lam, Louis I?  White  H R D  has been seen as an issue that is criticalfor U S .  corporations so that  they can remain competitive. Yet  little has been known about the strategc role  of  H R D  and how it may influence corporate performance.  In this study, we  have argued that HRD plays an immensely strategic role when combined with  effective recruitment and compensation policies. These three activities together  contribute to the company’s human resource (HR) orientation and create sw-  tainable competitive advantages for organizations. Datafrom fourteen  man-  ufacturing industries supported the proposition that companies with a strong  HR orientation performed signijicantly better than firms with a weaker H R   orientation. Suggestions were offered with respect to the strategic and devel-  opmental role of  H R  management.  The  United  States has  led  the  world  in  the  annual  rate  of  productivity  improvements since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. From the start  of  the 1950s, however, that productivity improvement factor has decreased sig-  nificantly  The reverse has been  true in countries such as Japan and other  Pacific Rim nations where the productivity growth rate has increased rapidly.  In 1972, productivity for the average Japanese worker was 63 percent of  that  of an American worker. This changed quickly so that by 1988, the average pro-  ductivity of  a Japanese worker  had  increased to 80 percent  of  the average  American worker’s productivity (Cascio, 1995). From 1970 to 1990, the pro-  ductivity growth rate for the American worker slowed to an average of  1.3 per-  cent annually  Since then, this alarming trend has begun to spawn a greater emphasis on  HRD. If  mishandled, employees can be a source of  major corporate difficul-  ties; if, on the other hand, they are dealt with competently, employees can be  developed to an organization’s competitive advantage (Becker and Gerhart,  1996). As a result, HRD is viewed as a significant issue for U.S. companies, so  that they can remain strategically competitive in the global market (Sonnen-  feld, 1985). Today, the challenge is to use HR in the planning and problem-  solving process in such a way that companies can identify the critical employee  HUMAN RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT QUARTERLY, VOl. 9, no. 4, Winter 1998  0 Jossey-Bass Publishers  351  352  Lam, White  skills in the corporate and business strategies (Hall, 1984; Butler, Ferris, and  Napier, 1991; Becker and Gerhart, 1996). HR executives are also expected to  act as change catalysts in making organizations more productive. This trend  reflects a growing awareness of  the contributions that HRD can make to the  firms success.  This growing awareness has spawned a number of  empirical studies that  investigate how HR  practices could contribute to a firm’s performance (for a  review, see Butler, Ferris, and Napier,  1991, and Becker and Gerhart,  1996).  Following this line of  research, many studies have centered on a single HR  practice, such as recruitment or compensation, and then evaluated the per-  formance effect on companies (Schmidt, Hunter, McKenzie, and Muldrow,  1979; Balkin and Gomez-Mejia, 1990; Gerhart and Milkovich, 1990). The  effectiveness  of  managerial  training  has  also  been  researched  extensively.  Although it was concluded that managerial training was overall moderately  effective in terms of  improvlng participants’ learning and job behavior (Burke  and Day, 1986; Bartel, 19941, relatively few studies have addressed whether  training programs can improve a company’s profitability (Magnum, Magnum,  and Hansen, 1990). As a result, trainers often have to justify the financial con-  tribution of their programs and explain how they may add value to the com-  pany (Gordon, 1987).  Although training and development alone may have little effect on cor-  porate  performance, they can be seen to play a much more  important role  when  coupled  with  effective  recruitment  and  compensation  practices  (Wright and Snell, 199 1).There has been speculation that researchers should  distinguish between the complete systemic view of  HR policies and the mere  adoption of  traditional  HR practices, because the systemic view may pro-  vide more details about the interaction of  different HR practices (Huselid,  Jackson, and Schuler, 1997; MacDuffie, 1995). In this study, we viewed the  complete implementation of  HR systems as a company orientation and eval-  uated whether such an orientation can lead to superior corporate perfor-  mance,  We  explained  from  a strategic  perspective  the  importance  of  effective  recruitment and compensation in attracting and retaining competent employ-  ees, as well as the significance of  training and development in terms of sus-  taining the human advantage. The creation  of  a strong HR orientation, we  argued, should include equally important roles for recruitment, compensation,  and training and development.  We measured  these HR  activities by surveying companies to determine  their perceptions of whether or not their competitors have strong HR  orienta-  tions. We found that companies that developed the reputation of being HR on-  ented also enjoyed significant financial payoffs in terms of  profitability, sales  growth, and appreciation of  stock values. At the end of  this chapter, we will  discuss the implications of  our findings for the research and practice of strate-  gic HR  development.  Human Resource Orientation and CorDorate Performance  353  Theoretical Background  Concept of  HR  Orientation.  In this study, we defined HR orientation as “a  systematic organizational effort to attract, retain, and develop competent and  committed human resources.” Organizations that develop a strong HR orien-  tation will not only adopt a single HR practice but also emphasize three behav-  ioral components-attraction,  retention, and development. In this way, they  will be transforming employees as the basis of sustainable competitive advan-  tages (see Figure  1). The process of creating sustainable competitive advan-  tages has been cited recently by theorists of strategic management to describe  how firms can trace their successes to their internal stock of resources (Barney,  1991; Prahalad and Hamel, 1990). From this perspective, human resources  are viewed on a par with technological or physical resources in terms of hav-  ing the same strategic potential. This strategic perspective has led Wright and  his colleagues to urge organizations to focus on the serial steps of recruitment,  compensation, and training in order to attract and develop competent employ-  ees (Wright and Snell, 1991; Wright and McMahan, 1992).  Following this approach, we identify recruitment as the first critical strat-  egy that HR-oriented firms will employ, because effective recruitment efforts  help the company “locate the relevant competencies and attract them to the  organization” (Wright and Snell, 1991, p. 221). Competent employees are not  necessarily loyal, however. To retain competent employees, it could be critical  Figure 1.  Components of HR Orientation  1.

Retention  Committed  employees  Lam, White  354  to have a competitive level of  compensation and fringe benefits (Balkin and  Gomez-Mejia, 1990; Gerhart and Milkmich, 1990).Therefore, the second step  involves implementing compensation strategies to improve employees’ level of  commitment. Finally, to sustain a competitive advantage, a company needs fur-  ther developmental investments to maintain the level of  superior HR compe-  tence (Magnum, Magnum, and Hansen, 1990). Rivals are constantly striving  to improve their competitive positions. Thus, a competitive advantage is not  sustainable unless a company makes continuous improvements to keep com-  petitors from matching its competence level. The third step in this HR orien-  tation also has to do with training a committed workforce. In interaction with  recruitment and compensation, increasing the workforce’s competence is pos-  tulated to increase workers’ sense of efficacy, because workers feel that they can  perform well enough to make significant contributions to the organization  (Hackman and Oldham, 1980). Thus, the level of  employee commitment may  also be enhanced through training and development.  Third, the extent of  HR orientation can also affect the way in which orga-  nizations organize their HR functions. Companies with a minimal HR orien-  tation often view the HR  department as a staff function. The department may  be  embedded  in  a larger  administrative  division, and the head  of  the  HR  department will therefore not assume a key role in the organizational hierar-  chy. A contrasting approach would elevate the HR  department to be on par  with other functional units. Although such a structural change alone will not  guarantee  a greater emphasis on HR, it should be viewed as a positive  step  On the other hand, the pursuit of an HR orientation can also exceed con-  ventional definitions of HR practices. There are cultural, strategc, structural, and  cognitive ramifications for organizations if they decide to adopt HR as their cor-  porate orientation. First, organizational culture represents a company’s values and  belief system (Schuler and Huber, 1993). The aspect of  organizational culture that  relates to employees is a company’s HR beliefs and values about the role of HR in  the success of corporations (Schuler, 1992). If companies believe strongly in the  importance of  HR, t h  convmion will be reflected in their HR activities. For exam-  ple, “companies such as Levi Strauss that have a culture of  caring for and respect-  ing the individual are likely to offer employment security and provide benefits for  a variety of employee needs. In this way, many employees learn the culture of the  it selects, what criteria it evaluates,  organization through the HR activitie-how  and what it compensates most highly’‘ (Schuler and Huber, 1993, p. 70).  Second, the pursuit of  an HR onentation represents a firm’s strategic choice  by recognizing that human resources, similar to other physical and techno-  logical resources, can become important ingredients of  a firm’s competitive  strategy (Barney. 1991; Wright and Snell, 1991; Wright and McMahan, 1992).  Companies adopting this approach should devote their attention to various  strategic HR practices, such as staffing, creating reward systems, and imple-  menting HRD, and should incorporate them into the company’s strategic plan  (Butler, Ferris, and Napier, 1991; Abelson, Ferris, and Urban, 1988).  Human Resource Orientation and Corporate Perjormance  355  toward a more holistic approach-one that recognizes HR as central to orga-  nizational design and effectiveness.  Finally, a strong HR orientation can alter the way organizations perceive  external events and the way they prioritize internal activities. Organizations are  said to adopt one of the four mental “frames” or perspectives as their cognitive  orientation.  These are structural, human resource, political,  and symbolic  frames (Bolman and Deal, 1997). This study focused on the creation of an HR  frame. Bolman and Deal argued that the adoption of an HR frame will enable  organizations to have “a sensitive understanding of people and their symbolic  relationship with organizations” (p. 102). We hold that a strong HR orientation  will help organizations recognize the human needs of their employees.  Impact ofHR  Orientation on Corporate Performance.  Does HR orientation  have any impact on corporate performance besides its cultural, strategic, struc-  tural, and cognitive manifestations? Yes, we believe there are two reasons behind  a positive impact of HR orientation on corporate performance. First, HR-oriented  firms are likely to enjoy substantial cost savings by reducing employee absen-  teeism and turnover rates. From a cost perspective, an absent employee often  means a loss in wages and benefits. The annual cost of unscheduled absence has  been estimated to range from about $250 to $500 per employee (Cascio, 1995).  It is beneficial, therefore, for firms to reduce the rate of absenteeism. For each case  of employee turnover, the company incurs additional expenses to terminate and  replace that person. The termination costs may include the expenses of an exit  interview and the increase of unemployment tax. After termination, new employ-  ees are needed to fill the vacant position. Thus, there will be an increase in  replacement costs in terms of additional recruiting and training (Cascio, 1995).  These replacement costs can be minimized if companies incorporate HRD activ-  ities into their strategic business plans so that they can rely more on existing  employees to fill vacant positions (Friedman and LeVino, 1984).  Second, HR-oriented firms are also likely to develop their employees into  a more competent workforce, because they place stronger emphasis on recruit-  ing, compensating, and training and development. The development of employ-  ees into a highly competent workforce has been argued to produce competitive  advantages that are more valuable and also more difficult to imitate (Pfeffer,  1994). For these reasons, a strong HR orientation may bring significant eco-  nomic benefits to companies (Gatewood and Field, 1994; Cascio, 1995). The  advantages of increasing employee commitment and creating a more compe-  tent workforce led us to propose the following research question: Does a strong  HR orientation have a positive impact on corporate performance?  Research Methodology  Industry Setting and Sample.  The sample consisted of  firms from four-  teen manufacturing industries in the United States.’ These fourteen industries  were  purposely  selected  to  create a  diverse  contextual  background.  They  356  Lam, White  include a variety of  products and manufacturing  technologies, ranging from  heavy equipment, such as farm machines and aircraft engines, to light equip-  ment, such as electrical  houseware  and electronic  components. They  also  include various industry structures, ranging from growing to declining indus-  tries, from oligopolistic to fragmented industries, and from high-technology to  low-technology industries.  The firms were selected from the COMPUSTAT database, which contains  financial and stock market information  for major  U.S. corporations. To  be  included  in  the sample, a firm had  to meet  several criteria. First, because  smaller firms are more prone to fold and are therefore less likely to be traced  in follow-up studies, we included only larger firms (those whose annual sales  were  $2.5 million  or more).  Second, to  avoid  confounding  corporate and  diversification effects on firm performance, we included only firms classified  as having a dominant business in a sampled industry (specifically, firms with  70 percent of  more of  their total sales in one of  the fourteen industries; see  Rumelt, 1974). Using these criteria, we selected 235 firms from the COMPU-  STAT database.  Measurement and Sources of  Data.  Multiple sources were used to collect  data on HR orientation and corporate performance.  HR  Orientation.  We  used survey techniques to collect data about each  firm’s HR orientation. Using the corporate and personnel data provided by the  COMPUSTAT database, Dun and Bradstreetk Million  Dollar Directory (1993),  and Standard and Poor’s Reguter of  Corporations, Directors, and Executives (1993),  we contacted four senior executives at each company in the fall of  1993. The sur-  vey was administered using the total design method (Dillman, 1978), which con-  sisted of pretests, pilot tests, prenotification postcards, first-round mail, follow-up  postcards, second-round mail, and second follow-up postcards. This procedure  yielded 246 usable questionnaires, which is equivalent to a response rate of 26.3  percent [246 responsed(235 firms x 4 executives)]. No statistical differences were  found between the responding and the nonresponding sample.’  Competitive assessment was used to determine the level of  HR orientation,  If a studys purpose is to document how certain HR practices are developed,  the firm itself is probably an ideal informant. Because we were more interested  in how corporate performance was affected, however, we believed that outside  constituents would be in a better, and perhaps more objective, position to  assess the external reputation of  a firm’s HR  orientation, As a result, we chose  competitors as the key informants in this study. A similar approach of  com-  petitive assessment was used by Cappelli and Crocker-Hefter (1996) when they  measured distinctive HR  competencies.  In a cover letter accompanying the questionnaire, we asked each execu-  tive to respond  to a series of  HR questions about two competing firms. We  determined  competitors by  locating firms in  the sampling frame  that  sold  products that were the most similar (the product information was provided by  COMPUSTAT). The survey was also initially designed so that executives of  Human Resource Orientation and Corporate Performance  35 7  each company would evaluate HR orientation for two competitors and so that  the company’s own HR orientation would also be evaluated by other execu-  tives  from  two  different  competing  firm^.^  In  the  final sample,  120 firms  received competitor responses.  As defined previously, an HR orientation is conceptualized as a systematic  organizational effort to attract, retain, and develop competent and committed  employees. Accordingly, we wanted respondents to evaluate a firm’s HR ori-  entation on these items (on a seven-point scale). We asked:  To what extent is the company characterized by  (a)  effective recruitment of valued employees?  (b)  above-average compensation and fringe benefits?  (c)  extensive training and development programs?  The results of Cronbachs alpha and intraclass correlation indicated that  the scale had achieved acceptable levels of  interitem and interrater reliability  Uudd, Smith, and Kidder, 1991; James, 1982; Glick, 19851.‘ Because of the  high level of convergence, we first averaged these items to generate individual  executive ratings. We then used the mean rating among executives to measure  HR orientation for each company  Corporate Performance.  In conducting studies of corporate performance,  researchers of strategic management have recommended using multiple mea-  sures of  corporate performance (Venkatraman and Ramanujam, 1986). As a  result, three different measures of corporate performance were used in this  study The first measure was return on assets. A firm’s return on assets is an indi-  cator of  accounting profitability. It was computed by dividing the operating  income by total assets in 1993. The second measure was growth in sales. Sales  growth can capture how well customers accept a company’s products or ser-  vices. We calculated the average annual growth of  sales between  1990 and  1993. The third measure was growth in stock values. To capture how well firms  maximize the shareholder’s value, we also measured the annual growth rate of  a firm’s stock market value. We did this by (1) computing market value (the  share price multiplied by the number of outstanding common shares) and (2)  calculating the average annual growth of  market values between  1990 and  1993. Because the data were skewed, a natural logarithm of  growth in market  values was used  as a dependent variable. Data for operating income, total  assets, sales, and stock market values were extracted from the COMPUSTAT  database.  Exogenous Factors.  Because the level of  corporate performance tends to  vary across industries, we included three types of  industry characteristics in  this study (see Dess, Ireland, and Hitt, 1990): research intensity, industry con-  centration, and industry growth. The level of  corporate performance may be  affected by the intensity of research efforts that characterizes each industry We  measured this industry characteristic by averaging the ratio of R&D expenses  358  Lam, White  and sales of the sampled firms in each of  the fourteen industries. These indus-  try-level  data  were  obtained  from  COMPUSTAT.  Industry  concentration  describes the structure of  the industry in terms of the level of control exercised  by large organizations. It was measured by the total market shares captured by  the largest four firms in an industry The data were provided by the U.S. Bureau  of  the Census.5 The rate at which an industry is growing shows the level of cus-  tomer demand for the products and services. This variable was measured using  the compound annual growth rate of  industry sales over a seven-year period  (1987 to 1994). The data were provided by The U S .  Industrial Outlook (1994).  In addition to accounting for industry effects, this study also controlled  for a number of  firm effects before examining how HR orientation  relates to  corporate performance  (see Capon, Farley, and Hoenig, 1990, for a review of  firm effects). Those firm effects included age, debt position, and market share.  A firm’s age may affect how the company performs. To control for this effect,  we used the number of years since a firm first issued stock as a proxy for a  company’s age. These data were provided  by COMPUSTAT. The amount of  debt a firm has may also affect its performance. The ratios of debt to total assets  in  1993 were extracted from COMPUSTAT. Like age, firm size may affect a  company’s financial performance. We measured size in terms of  a firm’s mar-  ket share relative to its largest three competitors. Measuring market share in  relative terms allows the variable to reflect the firm’s size advantage and mar-  ket position within its industry. Firm sales in  1993 were extracted  from the  COMPUSTAT database.  Empirical Findings  Table 1 lists univariate statistics and correlations for all the variables used in the  data analyses. Our research question predicted that an HR orientation would  relate to firm performance. Because the effect of  HR  orientation was expected  to be positive, a one-tailed test of  significance was used. As Table 2 indicates,  the beta coefficients of several exogenous factors are statistically significant when  return on assets is analyzed. This includes research intensity (p < .Ol), indus-  try growth rate (p < .05), and debt divided by total assets (p < .OOl). The find-  ings also suggest that after we account for these industry and firm effects, HR  orientation is still strongly related to return on assets (p < .05). Similar results  were also obtained when the other two measures of  firm performance were ana-  lyzed. In both cases, HR-oriented firms were able to outperform their competi-  tors in terms of growth in sales (p < .Ol) and growth in stock values (p < ,051.  Therefore, the overall results strongly support our research question; sig-  nificant financial payoffs were found among companies that strongly empha-  sized recruitment, compensation, and training and development. Through a  strong HR orientation, companies enjoy a more competent and committed  workforce, thus creating a sustainable competitive advantage that rivals will  find difficult to surpass. The result also illustrates the strategic importance of    0 1   9   8   7 6   5   4   3   2   1   D S     s n o i t a l e r r o C d n a   s c i t s i t a t S   e v i t p i r c s e D   . 1   e l b a T   n a e M   -   * * * 4 5 .   -   * * * 9 2 .   -   7 1 .   2 1 . 2 2   2 2 3 5 .   5 1 . 6 3 1   7 6 . 4   2 5 . 0 3   9 2 . 6 1 1 -     s e u l a v k c o t s   n i   h t w o r G   . 3   s e l a s   n i   h t w o r G   . 2   s t e s s a   n o n r u t e  R 1 .     s e l b a i r a v   t n e d n e p e D   e l b a i r a V   . 0 0  1 * * * 8 2 .   -   1 0 .   * * * 1 3   4 1 .  - * * * 8 3 . .   -   -   1 0 .   2 0 .   * 7 1 . -   5 1 . -   5 0   * 9 1 .   1 2 . . .   -   * * * 0 4 . -   5 1 . -   * * * 9 2   7 4 .   8 0 . -   6 0 . -   9 0 . -   2 0 . -   -   * * * 8 4 . -   -   4 1 . -   1 1 .   3 1 . -   * 9 1 . -   * * * 2 3 . -   3 1 . -   2 0 .   8 1 .   * * 2 2 . -   * * * 6 3 . -   9 0 .   7 0 . -   3 0 .   * 5 2 .   1 0 .   2 1 . -   3 1 .   * * 2 2 . -   4 1 .

HR orientation was defined as a systematic organi-  zational effort to attract, retain, and develop competent and committed employ-  ees. We proposed that HR-oriented organizations would perform better because  they place stronger emphasis on attraction, retention, and development in order  to create a low-cost sustainable competitive advantage. Data on HR orientation  were  obtained  from U.S. companies  in  fourteen manufacturing industries.  Results supported the hypothesis that companies with a strong HR orientation  performed significantly better than firms with a weaker HR orientation. Such  findings suggest that corporations have strong financial incentives in promot-  ing HR cultures and should invest heavily in their HR practices.  The findings should be interpreted carefully, however, with respect to the  limitations of  this study. First, as indicated earlier, the sample for this study  Human Resource Orientation and Corporate Performance  361  came from the 1993 COMPUSTAT database. This approach made the study  static; that is, we took a snapshot, or one-time view, of  certain aspects of a firm.  Future research could try to avoid this static approach. That is, a future inves-  tigation of  the hypothesis tested herein would attempt to find a causal rela-  tionship between HR orientation and firm performance over time. Data on firm  performance could be analyzed from the initiation of the corporate activity on  recruitment, compensation, and training and development. In this way, the  degree of an HR orientation’s impact could be determined more precisely This  method might then provide future studies with a more direct measurement of  the relationship between HR orientation and firm performance.  Second, there  are also certain  limitations  regarding the use  of  survey  methodology. For instance, various respondents may have different percep-  tions of an HR orientation. Future research should therefore consider alterna-  tive methods (for example, focus groups and case studies), so that results can  be compared with the measurement of  HR orientation.  Third, our findings may lack generalizability. To minimize potential noise  about corporate performance, we limited our sample to domestic, manufac-  turing companies. One should therefore exercise caution when generalizing  the results beyond the population from which the sample was drawn. To alle-  viate this issue, future studies might adopt a different sample, such as a more  international group of  organizations. Researchers would then be able to assess  the impact of cultural differences and of  differing nations on the HR orienta-  tion and corporate performance. If incorporated, these suggestions might shed  light on the consistently increasing importance of HR orientation and its role  in successful corporate performance in the global arena.  Despite the need for further research, our findings may have strong impli-  cations regarding the demand for strategic HR development and the expanded  strategic role of  HR executives. First, the conventional view regarding HRD is  that it is needed when companies experience (1) a lack of  qualified employ-  ees,  (2) changes  of  job performance  standards,  or  (3) a high  variance  of  employee outputs for the same job (Hall and Goodale, 1986). Our findings  imply an additional strategic need for HRD; besides ensuring effective recruit-  ment and compensation systems, HRD helps to sustain the human advantage  vis-a-vis competitors.  Second, our results imply that the workforce can add a valuable compet-  itive advantage for organizations. Consequently, we believe that HRD should  be one of  the building blocks in corporate strategic plans. HR directors should  be included at the strategic level of  decision making similar to directors of  other functional areas. This strategic restructuring would then allow the HR  director to help select strategic alternatives so that HR strategies could be for-  mulated to support organizational strategic choices (Hall, 1984). The employ-  ees needed to support the organizational strategy could then be recruited.  Available staffing requirements would be known and fulfilled, wage and salary  policies could be worked through, and necessary training requirements would  3 62  Lam, White  be developed so that critical HRD activities could be initiated. Firms adopting  such an HR orientation would then be positioned  to capitalize on the advan-  tages of  a well-trained and committed workforce.  Notes  1. COMPUSTAT contained  more than fourteen manufactunng  industnes. These are the four-  teen industnes selected for the study: farm machines, office machines, refrigerator and heating  equipment. electrical houseware, audio and video equipment, personal wireless communication  equipment. electronic components, auto parts, aircraft, aircraft engines, aircraft parts, electrical  testing and measuring instruments, analytical instruments,  and measuring and control devices.  We chose only manufacturing industnes in order to minimize the influences of macroeconomic  factors (for example, capital investment and economic cycles) on corporate performance.  2.  No significant differences (p <  05) were noticed between the responding and the nonre-  sponding samples in t e r n  of  firm size (log of  annual sales [t = 0.881, log of total assets [ t  = 0.691)  or in terms of  firm performance (return on assets  It = 0.161, stock market values  [ t  = 1.911).  3.  In the final sample, some firms received one response from one of their competitors whereas  others received multiple responses. When analyzing the data, we  recognized that the number of  respondents was not equal among the companies and that this discrepancy could introduce poten-  tial biases to the findings  The results of intraclass correlations (ICC(1) and ICC(2)), however, sug-  gested that both single-rater  and mean-rater  responses  were reliable.  In terms of  single-rater  response, the ICC(1) was 0 36, surpassing the acceptable level of  single-rater reliability proposed  by James (1982). In other words, the information on HR orientation was reliable, even though one  response was used per firm. Based on this information, firms having one response were included  in the data analysis. In terms of multiple responses per firm, the level of  ICC(2) was 0.65, which  also reached the acceptable  standard of  mean-rater  reliability proposed  by Glick (1985). As a  result, when a firm received multiple responses, we used the average to measure HR orientation.  4. Cronbach's alpha was .82 for the interitem reliability. Also see note 3.  5.
