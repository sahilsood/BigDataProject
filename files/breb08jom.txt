Human Resource Flexibility as a Mediating Variable Between High Performance Work Systems and Performance Inmaculada Beltrán-Martín* Vicente Roca-Puig Ana Escrig-Tena Juan Carlos Bou-Llusar Departamento Administracion de Empresas y Marketing, Facultad Ciencias Juridicas y Economicas, Universitat Jaume I, Castellon (12071)-Spain Much of the human resource management literature has demonstrated the impact of high per- formance work systems (HPWS) on organizational performance. A new generation of studies is emerging in this literature that recommends the inclusion of mediating variables between HPWS and organizational performance. The increasing rate of dynamism in competitive environments suggests that measures of employee adaptability should be included as a mechanism that may explain the relevance of HPWS to firm competitiveness. On a sample of 226 Spanish firms, the study’s  results  confirm  that  HPWS  influences  performance  through  its  impact  on  the  firm’s human resource (HR) flexibility. Keywords: human  resource  flexibility;  high  performance  work  systems;  mediating  effects; organizational performance; resource-based view Over the past decades, several empirical studies have suggested that high performance work  systems  (HPWS)  contribute  to  facilitating  growth  of  organizations  and  improving *Corresponding author: Tel.: +34-96472854; fax: +34-964728629 E-mail address: ibeltran@emp.uji.es  Journal of Management, Vol. 34 No. 5, October 2008 1009-1044 DOI: 10.1177/0149206308318616 © 2008 Southern Management Association.

Most of these  studies  draw  from  the  resource-based  view  (RBV)  to  formulate  and  empirically demonstrate the relationship between HPWS and organizational performance (e.g., Becker & Huselid, 1998; Huselid, 1995; Koch & McGrath, 1996). However, some of the literature suggests that a better understanding of how HPWS enhance organizational effectiveness can be achieved by assuming that before it is evidenced in final results, HPWS influence other intermediate  organizational  outcomes,  mostly  related  to  employee  responses  and  perfor- mance at work (Huselid & Becker, 2000). Recently, a number of studies have made initial attempts to examine the processes that explain the influence of HPWS on firm performance (e.g., Moynihan, Gardner, Park, & Wright, 2001; Ramsay, Scholarios, & Harley, 2000), but to date there is a lack of unequivocal evidence about which variables mediate the relation- ship between HPWS and performance and to what extent they do so. In  this  vein,  contradictions  have  emerged  regarding  the  actual  relevance  of  a  set  of employee  outcomes  (e.g.,  employee  skills,  motivation,  or  commitment)  as  intermediate mechanisms. Some existing studies focusing on specific HPWS practices conclude that the indirect effect of HPWS on performance through employee outcomes depends on the HPWS practice  that  is  taken  into  account  (e.g.,  Fey,  Bjorkman,  &  Pavlovskaya,  2000;  Paré  & Tremblay, 2007; Paul & Anantharaman, 2003). Other scholars analyze HPWS as a whole and find that although some of these employee outcomes mediate the influence of HPWS on performance, the mediation effect is partial (e.g., Katou & Budhwar, 2006; Park, Mitsuhashi, Fey, & Bjorkman, 2003; Sun, Aryee, & Law, 2007), which indicates that researchers should consider  other  potential  mediator  variables  when  explaining  the  intermediate  processes. Finally, studies such as Moynihan et al. (2001) and Ramsay et al. (2000) showed weak and even nonsignificant effects of the mediator variables in their models. For example, Ramsay et al.’s (2000) discussion of their work highlighted that “the widely held assumption that pos- itive  performance  outcomes  from  HPWS  flow  via  positive  employee  outcomes  has  been shown to be highly questionable” (p. 521). In sum, prior evidence indicates that there are still some omitted variables in the HPWS–performance linkage that reduce the explanatory infor- mation of these models. Recent theoretical advances in the HPWS field suggest that the debate should be taken further by including additional intermediate variables that can improve our understanding of the processes through which HPWS influence firm outcomes (e.g., Boxall & Purcell, 2000). Specifically, the application of the RBV in the HPWS literature is placing growing empha- sis on organizational flexibility and firm growth (Boxall & Purcell, 2000). Colbert (2004) argued  that  limiting  the  discussion  to  adaptive  concepts  such  as  employee  organizational commitment, which contribute to implementing an a priori defined strategy, limits the power of the RBV as originally articulated by Penrose (1959). The relevance of HPWS should not only focus on the attainment of favorable returns in the current context but also on prepar- ing firms for the challenges of the new context (Evans & Genadry, 1999). Recent attention to the increasing dynamism of competitive environments and the emergence of new princi- ples to manage firms in these contexts points to human resource (HR) flexibility as a poten- tial mediator of the relationship between HPWS and organizational outcomes (Bhattacharya, Gibson, & Doty, 2005; Cappelli & Newmark, 2004; Dyer & Shafer, 2002; van den Beukel & Molleman, 1998). Beltrán-Martín et al. / Human Resource Flexibility 1011 Figure 1 Theoretical Models Sector Size γ2 γ3 HPWS γ1 ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE Direct Effect Model HPWS γ4 Sector Size γ2 γ3 γ1 ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE β1 HR FLEXIBILITY  Mediated Model Note: HPWS = high performance work systems; HR = human resource. The purpose of our study is to empirically test whether HR flexibility acts as a mediating variable in the HPWS–firm performance linkage (Figure 1). Although various scholars high- light the relevance of HR flexibility as a potential mediator (e.g., Bhattacharya et al., 2005; Wright & Snell, 1998), this study is arguably among the first to examine the potential inter- vening role of this variable in the relationship between HPWS and organizational perfor- mance.  Our  research  sets  out  to  complement  previous  research  work  that  explores  the mechanisms between HPWS and performance by considering a more proactive component of employee performance at work that goes beyond traditional job-related variables such as 1012 Journal of Management / October 2008 employee commitment or satisfaction and that is in accordance with the most recent RBV trends (Boxall & Purcell, 2000). The article is organized in five sections. The first section offers an overview of HPWS and its contribution to firm performance. The second section presents the definition of HR flex- ibility from the resource-based view and its consideration as a mediating mechanism in the HPWS–performance linkage. In the third section, we present the empirical research carried out and the methodology. The fourth section provides an overview of the main results, and the fifth section summarizes the conclusions, implications, and future lines of research stem- ming from this study. High Performance Work Systems The  term  high  performance  work  systems  refers  to  a  human  resource  management approach that tries to elicit employee commitment to and involvement with the organiza- tional goals so that people’s behavior is self-regulated rather than controlled by sanctions and pressures (Walton, 1985; Wood & Albanese, 1995). This commitment-oriented model has been central in the human resource management (HRM) field, and many related terms have emerged,  such  as  high  commitment  management (e.g., Arthur,  1994;  Gallie,  Felstead,  & Green,  2001;  Whitener,  2001),  high  involvement  management (e.g.,  Edwards  &  Wright, 2001;  Guthrie,  2001),  or  progressive  human  resource  management (e.g.,  Cappelli  & Newmark, 2001; Ichniowski, 1990), all of which have been regarded as synonyms. HPWS  aim  to  increase  productivity  and  effectiveness  and  rely  on  conditions  that  help employees  to  identify  with  the  firm’s  goals  and  to  work  hard  to  accomplish  those  goals (Whitener, 2001). With this purpose, the adoption of HPWS entails the use of certain HRM practices, although no consensus has yet been reached on what these practices are (Becker &  Gerhart,  1996;  Dyer  &  Reeves,  1995;  Guest,  1997;  Wright  &  Gardner,  2003).  In  our research we consider that HPWS are made up of four dimensions, namely, comprehensive staffing, extensive training, developmental performance appraisal, and equitable reward sys- tems. In line with some scholars (e.g., Snell & Dean, 1992; Wright, Garnder, & Moynihan, 2003; Wright, McCormick, Sherman, & McMahan, 1999; Youndt, Snell, Dean, & Lepak, 1996), we consider these dimensions to represent the major areas of HPWS that appear in almost all the empirical research in this field. HPWS  comprise  practices  aimed  at  enhancing  the  firm’s  human  capital,  under  the premise that employee potential is not fully utilized and can be enhanced through the appro- priate means. According to Delery and Doty (1996), a higher level of human capital can be attained by focusing on either the selection processes that determine the characteristics of the workforce or on developmental actions covering current employees, which thus introduces the first two dimensions of HWPS, respectively. First, human capital–enhancing efforts can be oriented toward guaranteeing an appropri- ate competence pool among the employees hired. In this vein, comprehensive staffing pro- cedures are a critical element to determine the nature of the organization’s future workforce (Delaney  &  Huselid,  1996;  Huselid,  1995;  Whitener,  2001; Youndt  et  al.,  1996).  HPWS place  special  emphasis  on  finding  the  right  person  for  each  position  by,  for  instance, Beltrán-Martín et al. / Human Resource Flexibility 1013 considering a high number of candidates for each vacancy (Huselid, 1995; Whitener, 2001) or using extensive and detailed staffing procedures (Snell & Dean, 1992). Second, organizations can improve their human capital by providing developmental activ- ities after selection. Several studies in the HPWS literature have highlighted the need for extensive training programs either in terms of the number of hours provided or the percent- age of employees covered by the training programs (Delaney & Huselid, 1996; MacDuffie, 1995; Youndt et al., 1996). Third, another main feature of HPWS is that they attempt to eliminate the worst aspects of routinized work and to provide intrinsically satisfying tasks (Wood & Albanese, 1995). From an HPWS philosophy, the organization tries to utilize human resources to the fullest by providing high-quality, challenging jobs (Guest, 1987). When work is enriched as in an HPWS context, performance appraisal takes on an important developmental role. The dis- cretion encouraged in employees is often accompanied by a managerial emphasis on devot- ing  more  time  to  providing  feedback,  discussing  problems,  and  identifying  areas  for employee performance improvement (Snell & Dean, 1992). Fourth,  because  employees  need  to  be  motivated  to  contribute  effectively  to  organiza- tional success, HPWS also provide a rewards structure consisting of monetary and nonmon- etary rewards that employees perceive as equitable (Applebaum, Bailey, Berg, & Kalleberg, 2000; Bailey, 1993; Takeuchi, Marinova, Lepack, & Moon, 2004). Research in social psy- chology  has  demonstrated  that  employees’ perceptions  of  equity  affect  their  decisions  to join, remain, and produce for a firm (Snell & Dean, 1992). In this regard, HPWS promulgate reward equity that leads to employees’ perception of a match between their own inputs and outcomes and those of relevant others (Lam, Schaubroeck, & Aryee, 2002; Paterson, Green, & Cary, 2002). These relevant others may refer to other companies, that is, the firm offers similar  rewards  to  other  companies  for  the  same  job  position  (i.e.,  external  equity),  or  to other employees within the organization, for example, by implementing merit pay schemes that reward employees in proportion to their contributions or by avoiding wide variations in salaries within the same unit (i.e., internal equity) (Campbell, Campbell, & Chia, 1998). In addition, the HPWS literature emphasizes the need to adopt coherent systems of prac- tices  (Arthur,  1994;  Delery  &  Doty,  1996)  to  capture  the  complementarities  among  the HPWS  components,  under  the  premise  that  an  HPWS  practice  may  be  more  effective  in stimulating  the  desired  employee  outcomes  when  the  firm  implements  it  in  concert  with other  HPWS  practices  (Ichniowski,  Shaw,  &  Prennushi,  1997).  The  empirical  evidence shows  that  many  HPWS  practices  are  usually  found  together  (i.e.,  there  is  an  internal  fit among  them)  because  they  are  driven  from  a  common  philosophy  (Gallie  et  al.,  2001; Vandenberg, Richardson, & Eastman, 1999). In terms of the conceptualization of HPWS pre- sented in this study and following the suggestions by Wood and Albanese (1995), we assume that there is an underlying approach to the management of training, staffing, appraisal, and rewards practices that explains the association between them. The RBV of the firm (Amit & Schoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984) argues that HPWS can lead to competitive advantages by developing a unique and valuable human capital pool (Delery, 1998). Studies such as Wright, McMahan, and McWilliams (1994) or Boxall and Purcell (2000) found that HPWS contribute to building a human capital pool and to stimulating certain valuable human behaviors in the firm that are at the same time rare and 1014 Journal of Management / October 2008 difficult to imitate. Many studies have demonstrated the strategic relevance of HPWS for the firm in terms of HPWS impact on organizational performance (Arthur, 1992, 1994; Delaney & Huselid, 1996; Huselid, 1995; Huselid, Jackson, & Schuler, 1997). In addition, some of these studies highlight the effect of integrated HPWS on organizational results due to added synergies gained  from  the  conglomeration  of  practices  (Delery  &  Doty,  1996;  MacDuffie  &  Kochan, 1995; Park et al., 2003). Drawing from these studies, we formulate the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1: HPWS will have a positive effect on organizational performance. Human Resource Flexibility Organizations  now  operate  in  environments  with  unprecedented  and  unpredictable  events resulting  from  several  factors,  such  as  technological  advances  or  market  globalization  (Hitt, Keats, & Demarie, 1998; Shafer, Dyer, Kitty, Amos, & Ericksen, 2001). These circumstances have forced managers to make paradigm shifts in guiding their organizations, and new princi- ples have emerged for managing firms in these environments where time frames for strategic decisions are shorter. The heightened demands on organizations have subsequently called for a corresponding staff of flexible and capable individuals (van den Beukel & Molleman, 1998). In modern companies, proficiency in the performance of a set of assigned tasks is not enough to guarantee competitive advantages, and aspects related to employee flexibility are included in the new job performance standards (Hesketh & Neal, 1999). In this section we first present a defi- nition of HR flexibility proposed from the RBV perspective. Following this, we discuss the rel- evance that HR flexibility may have in the effect of HPWS on performance. HR Flexibility From the RBV As discussed earlier, the RBV of the firm is a valid framework in the HRM field (Wright et al., 1994). Moreover, it also provides an interesting theoretical basis on which to advance knowledge  about  HR  flexibility  (Bhattacharya  et  al.,  2005;  Chadwick  &  Cappelli,  1999; Dyer & Shafer, 1999; Lepak, Takeuchi, & Snell, 2003; Wright & Snell, 1998). From this the- oretical point of view, the definition of HR flexibility has an internal orientation because HR flexibility refers to the extent to which employees possess skills and behavioral repertoires that can provide a firm with options to pursue strategic alternatives (Wright & Snell, 1998). Employees like these, mobilized through the appropriate human resource practices, consti- tute  a  source  of  competitive  advantages.  Consequently,  researchers  should  make  greater efforts to disentangle the meaning and components of HR flexibility. According to Wright and Snell (1998), one of the main features of a flexible workforce is employees’ ability to accomplish a large number of diverse tasks. This idea corresponds to the notion of functional flexibility, which implies that employees are able to work on differ- ent tasks and under diverse circumstances and that the costs and time needed to mobilize employees into new duties or jobs are low (van den Berg & van der Velde, 2005). Therefore, functional  flexibility  is  similar  to  workforce  versatility or  polyvalence,  which  facilitates employee movements between jobs or the assumption of responsibility for multiple tasks from other jobs (Cordery, 1989; Riley & Lockwood, 1997). Beltrán-Martín et al. / Human Resource Flexibility 1015 Moreover,  employees  are  flexible  when  they  are  able  to  learn  quickly  to  perform  new tasks (Bhattacharya et al., 2005; Wright & Snell, 1998), which corresponds to the idea of skill malleability (Maurer, Wrenn, Pierce, Tross, & Collins, 2003). Rather than focusing on the  current  breadth  of  competences,  skill  malleability  refers  to  how  easily  and  quickly employees assimilate new skills and abilities. In this sense, employees show skill malleabil- ity when they train and retrain as necessary, anticipate future skill requirements, or demon- strate enthusiasm for learning new approaches to perform their jobs (Arulampalam & Booth, 1998; Dyer & Ericksen, 2005; Pulakos, Arad, Donovan, & Plondon, 2000). Finally, flexible human resources are characterized by exhibiting behavior flexibility, that is, by showing a variety of behavioral repertoires in different circumstances (Bhattacharya et al., 2005). According to Wright and Snell (1998), employee behaviors are the scripts or sequences that employees adopt in their jobs. If an employee who has applied a particular script in repetitive work situations selects the same script to deal with a novel situation, his or her behaviors are considered rigid. In contrast, if employees look for new sequences of actions with which to perform their daily activities or to face new circumstances, their behaviors are flexible. Thus, this concept involves a greater tolerance for nonroutine behavior, according to which employees adapt their responses to new circumstances, based on improvisation and not on fixed patterns of action (Bhattacharya et al., 2005; Dyer & Ericksen, 2005). In sum, for the purposes of this study we consider three components in the definition of HR  flexibility:  functional  flexibility,  skill  malleability,  and  behavior  flexibility. This  con- ceptualization  resembles  previous  definitions  provided  from  the  RBV  perspective  (e.g., Bhattacharya et al., 2005). In addition, a review of this literature provides several theoretical arguments that sustain the interdependencies between these dimensions. For instance, some authors hold that employees manifesting functional flexibility possess a wide repertoire of competences or a set of general abilities such as leadership or problem-solving skills that encourage them to extend their current pool of skills, that is, to show higher skill malleability (Wright & Snell, 1998). Moreover, accord- ing to Simon (1993), continuous learning processes associated with employee skill malleability demand the adoption of new cultural values and structural mechanisms, which eventually change the viewpoint and the role of the individual in the firm and thus his or her willingness to show adaptable behaviors (Senge, 1990, 1993). Therefore, the definition of HR flexibility in our study takes into account the interdependencies among the dimensions of flexibility. HR Flexibility as a Mediating Variable Although the notion that flexible employees have become a competitive asset in modern organizations is widespread (Lawler, 1994), so far this claim has not been fully supported by empirical evidence. Studies on the influence of HR flexibility on organizational performance and on the relevance of HPWS to fostering HR flexibility provide a basis for the considera- tion of HR flexibility as a mediating variable in the HPWS–performance linkage. HR  flexibility–performance  relationship.  Several  studies  have  demonstrated  that employee  functional  flexibility,  as  one  of  the  main  components  of  HR  flexibility,  signifi- cantly affects firm performance. Studies within the framework of human capital theory argue 1016 Journal of Management / October 2008 that the pool of skills and abilities that underlies employees’ functional flexibility determines their capacity to be responsible for several activities in the organization (Rönnmar, 2004). Employees with a broad knowledge base contribute to the organization’s competitive advan- tage as this base generates greater capabilities to develop more efficient means of accom- plishing task requirements (Boxall, 1999; Wright et al., 1994). Some scholars assume that higher  functional  flexibility  leads  to  more  satisfied  and  motivated  employees  and  thus  to higher labor productivity (Cordery, Sevastos, Mueller, & Parker, 1993) and lower employee turnover (Kelliher & Riley, 2003). Also, employee polyvalence reduces the number of line managers, thus diminishing administrative levels and associated costs (Valverde, Tregaskis, & Brewster, 2000). Furthermore, employees who show functional flexibility maintain prof- itable relationships with customers, contributing to satisfying their needs and enhancing their satisfaction (Youndt & Snell, 2004). In addition, HR flexibility may be relevant in the adoption of innovative solutions in the firm because skill malleability implies that employees are able to respond in better ways to stimuli that have appeared previously. Furthermore, when employees continuously improve their pool of knowledge, their performance variability at work reduces over time, thereby increasing productivity (Lado & Wilson, 1994). Similarly, the behavior flexibility dimension of  HR  flexibility  encourages  organization  members  to  improvise  and  think  of  new  ideas, question and reflect on their actions, and make sense of and generate new understandings from those actions. For example, it permits organization members to reduce production and service  delivery  costs  and  develop  new  process  innovations  that  eliminate  costly  steps  or reduce inputs (Youndt & Snell, 2004). Some empirical studies have demonstrated the impact of this type of employee on job performance (Crant, 1995), job satisfaction (Seibert, Crant, &  Kraimer,  1999),  productivity,  customer  service  and  commitment  (Kirkman  &  Rosen, 1999), and financial performance measures (Bhattacharya et al., 2005). HPWS–HR flexibility relationship. The benefits that HR flexibility provides for the firm’s performance  have  encouraged  researchers  to  analyze  the  mechanisms  through  which  the firm can promote the flexibility of its workforce. In this sense, many authors consider human resource activities, and in particular HPWS, to be an appropriate instrument to increase HR flexibility levels (Dyer & Shafer, 2002; Sparrow, 1998). HPWS  influence  HR  flexibility  through  human  capital–enhancing  activities,  mainly related to training and staffing activities, which are oriented toward the promotion of a cli- mate of personal growth in the firm, enabling employees to prepare for whatever the future might bring in terms of abilities or behaviors needed in the workplace (Shafer et al., 2001). Due to the rapid process of knowledge obsolescence in current environments, the importance of being “ahead on the learning curve” is crucial in creating flexible employees (Dyer & Shafer, 2002). Extensive developmental activities in the HPWS are likely to favor the abili- ties needed to perform a variety of tasks effectively, namely, to promote functional flexibil- ity (Friedrich, Kabst, Weber, & Rodehuth, 1998; van Dam & Thierry, 2000). In addition, the focus of HPWS on the workforce’s development provides a firm with a skilled workforce capable of ongoing learning (Batt, 2002; Youndt & Snell, 2004). Thus, these developmental efforts on the part of the organization are also beneficial in promoting the workforce’s skill malleability because employees are keen to increase their current pool of skills and abilities Beltrán-Martín et al. / Human Resource Flexibility 1017 when they possess a valid educational basis because proficiency in certain areas gives them the confidence to master and apply new skills (Wright & Snell, 1998). The firm’s efforts to broaden the workforce’s skills and competences also allow employees to conceive alterna- tive  methods  of  carrying  out  their  jobs,  thus  fostering  behavior  flexibility  (Frese,  Kring, Soose, & Zempel, 1996; Parker & Axtell, 2000). The developmental appraisal component of HPWS encourages employee flexibility for several reasons. On one hand, appraisal activities constitute an organizational communica- tion tool that helps the firm to shape the psychological contract, that is, to clarify the set of reciprocal  expectations  between  the  employee  and  the  organization  (Guest  &  Conway, 2002). According to the psychological contract perspective, the use of developmental per- formance appraisals generates a more positive view of the exchange in the sense that the con- tract  has  been  met  and  high  levels  of  trust  exist  between  the  employee  and  the  employer (Guest & Conway, 2002). Employees who perceive they are being treated fairly in the orga- nization are more willing to adjust to the kind of adversities that can appear in the workplace, therefore becoming more flexible (Cobb, Folger, & Wooten, 1995; Moorman, 1991). In this regard, Cavanaugh and Noe (1999) found that employee participation in appraisal activities gives employees a greater sense of control over their professional careers, which contributes to fostering their willingness to participate in the firm’s change processes through skill mal- leability or behavior flexibility. On  the  other  hand,  the  use  of  developmental  appraisals  comprises  certain  elements  of employees’ involvement, by allowing employees to participate in the establishment of per- formance standards or by discussing performance achievements with them, all of which con- tribute to extending the role of employees in the firm. Employees with extended roles in the firm  assume  that  key  competences  at  work  are  multiple,  and  they  feel  responsible  for  a broader range of problems, which leads to their willingness to be flexible (Parker, 2000). For example, Wright and Snell (1998) suggested that these initiatives encourage employees that are more willing to develop their pool of competences rather than those with a narrow vision of their role in the organization, therefore showing higher skill malleability. Moreover,  HPWS  may  impact  HR  flexibility  through  the  provision  of  appropriate rewards. Some authors highlight the relevance of equitable rewards to encourage employees’ willingness to move and reallocate as the need arises (i.e., to show functional flexibility). Fluid assignments implicit in the notion of functional flexibility require considerably high inputs  from  the  workforce  and  organizations  should  provide  commensurate  returns  in  an effort to motivate desired employee movements across tasks and jobs (Dyer & Shafer, 2002; Noe, 1996). Furthermore, the provision of equitable rewards is an instrument that helps to attract versatile employees because employees with high qualifications, varied knowledge, and multiple abilities may expect to receive appropriate rewards for their competences. This component of HPWS can also motivate employees to engage in flexible behaviors and effec- tive discretionary decision making in response to a variety of internal and external contin- gencies  (MacDuffie,  1995;  Wright  &  Snell,  1998).  Several  authors  argue  that  equitable rewards provide employees with the confidence to take initiative and behave flexibly at work because they are aware that the organization will recognize their efforts in proposing creative solutions to new problems (Frenkel, Korczynski, Shire, & Tam, 1999; Unsworth & Parker, 2003).  In  fact,  authors  such  as  Morris  (1993)  indicate  that  one  of  the  components  of 1018 Journal of Management / October 2008 equitable rewards—performance-related pay—is used as a signal to express organizational intentions and create a flexible and self-motivated workforce. According to Unsworth and Parker (2003), higher initiative and flexibility at work can involve a greater workload, which may produce stress and anxiety in employees if these efforts are not reinforced by equitable rewards. A fair, balanced exchange relationship with the organization enhances feelings of certainty  about  gaining  fair  rewards  for  substantial  innovative  efforts  (Williams,  Pitre,  & Zainuba, 2002). The aforementioned reasoning leads us to propose that a relevant mediating process by which HPWS affect performance is through improvements in the flexibility levels of human resources.  Thus,  we  hypothesize  that  the  reason  why  HPWS  impact  firm  performance  is because they affect HR flexibility, which is a critical determinant of the outcomes the firm achieves. This idea is expressed as follows: Hypothesis  2: HR  flexibility  will  mediate  the  relationship  between  HPWS  and  organizational performance. Data Collection Method The fieldwork for this study took place from May to October 2005 on a sample of Spanish industrial and service companies with 100 or more employees. We used company size to delimit the population because the literature considers that a minimum size is required to identify companies with an explicit or formalized human resource strategy (Lepak & Snell, 2002). According to this criterion, the population for our study was made up of 3,427 firms in different sectors. The unit of analysis in our study is the commercial departments of the companies; that is, we are interested in the linkages between HPWS, HR flexibility, and performance related to salespeople in our sample of firms. The nature of work in this department refers not only to the generation of sales but also the creation of strong relationships with customers (Román, Ruiz, & Munuera, 2002; Wilson, 2000). Nowadays, commercial teams focus on implement- ing  a  customer-oriented  approach,  which  implies  solving  customers’ problems,  providing opportunities, and adding value to the customer’s business over an extended period of time (Flaherty, Dahlstrom, & Skinner, 1999). In the words of Weitz and Bradford (1999), employ- ees in this area act as boundary spanners by building customer relationships and creating value. In their boundary-spanning roles, salespeople are responsible for making decisions and  working  with  limited  supervision,  showing  differences  from  internal  employees (Chonko,  Jones,  Roberts,  &  Dubinsky,  2002). As  Marshall,  Moncrief,  and  Lassk  (1999) demonstrated, the commercial function in an organization covers a wide range of activities (these authors identified up to 83 different activities in the sales function across a sample of firms in different sectors). In addition, over the past decade, some new activities have been added to the responsibilities of employees in this function, mostly related to communication, team building, or database management (Marshall et al., 1999). Beltrán-Martín et al. / Human Resource Flexibility 1019 The limitation of the study to this area has several advantages. On one hand, as HPWS refer only to one group of employees in the firm, some improvements to the reliability of the HPWS  measurement  can  be  made  (Delery,  1998).  Several  scholars  have  suggested  that human resource practices vary with respect to location, type of employee, or business unit. In this regard, Tsui, Pearce, Porter, and Tripoli (1997) provided strong evidence that organi- zations  use  different  human  resource  practices  for  employees  in  different  jobs. Consequently,  one  informant  is  unlikely  to  provide  an  accurate  definition  of  the  human resource practices that correspond to different jobs (Wright & Gardner, 2003). For the same reason, a general assessment of the human resource practices for the whole workforce would not be appropriate (Lepak & Snell, 2002). To avoid these problems, some studies have rec- ommended focusing on specific jobs or a group of similar jobs (Delery, 1998). Furthermore, employees in the commercial department are increasingly relevant to competi- tion in current environments (Slater & Olson, 2000). The sales or commercial occupation has considerable relevance to the economies of most countries because this function plays an essen- tial role in guaranteeing the success of many firms (Farrell & Hakstian, 2001). For this reason, enhancing the performance of salespeople is one of the most urgent tasks managers face (Boles, Brashear, Bellenger, & Barksdale, 2000). However, the notion of salespeople’s performance is changing because several external challenges are affecting the commercial function in modern firms: Customers have more information, competition is stronger due to market globalization, and technology is continually becoming more advanced (Ingram, 2004; Román et al., 2002; Wotruba, 1996). In the Spanish context, the commercial function in companies is also facing increasing customer demands, microsegmentation of domestic markets, advances in information technologies  and  telecommunications,  direct-marketing  alternatives,  and  higher  competition (Kuster & Canales, 2006). In these circumstances, contemporary sales forces are under pressure to change and adapt to new circumstances in their daily tasks (Chonko et al., 2002). We collected data through the administration of structured questionnaires to the commer- cial managers in the companies. Our analyses included a total of 226 valid responses. Of these companies, 37% were from service sectors and 63% from industrial sectors. Regarding organizational size, 49% of the companies were medium sized (100 to 249 employees) and 51%  were  large  companies  (250  employees  or  more). The  sample  error  in  our  study  was ±6.3%. This sample error is relatively high, but this is a typical situation in research con- ducted in Spain, where collaboration between companies and universities is not easily estab- lished (Camelo, Martín, Romero, & Valle, 2004; Valle, Martín, Romero, & Dolan, 2000). To examine the representativeness of the sample and the risk of nonresponse bias, we compared the  characteristics  (organizational  size)  of  the  population  to  those  of  the  sample  (Short, Ketchen, & Palmer, 2002). We performed an ANOVA to compare size (number of employ- ees) between the two groups of companies. The result of this analysis (F = 1.313; p = .252) shows no significant difference and therefore supports the representativeness of the sample. Measurement The appendix provides a detailed description of the measures used in our research. To mea- sure HPWS, we used Snell and Dean’s (1992) scale, which covers items related to selective 1020 Journal of Management / October 2008 staffing,  comprehensive  training,  developmental  performance  appraisal,  and  equitable reward systems. As in the original scale, questions in our questionnaire ranged from 1 to 7, with anchors varying according to the question. Subsequent studies have used this scale and demonstrated the validity of its measurement properties (Whitener, 2001). As described in the definition of HPWS, there should be an internal fit between the previous dimensions. In this  study,  we  operationalize  HPWS  internal  fit  as  covariation based  on  factor  analysis (Venkatraman, 1989). According to this perspective, the common variation of HPWS dimen- sions is explained by a latent factor (HPWS) that captures their covariance (Delery, 1998; Dorenbosch, van Veldhoven, & Poell, 2005; Wood, 1996; Wood & Albanese, 1995). We measured HR flexibility with an adaptation of the measurement scales proposed by Volverda (1998) and Verdú (2002) to assess functional flexibility. In measuring skill mal- leability we followed the suggestions provided by Pulakos et al. (2000) to develop a scale designed to assess the facility with which employees alter their skill base as the need arises. To measure behavior flexibility, we selected a set of items used by Frese et al. (1996) to eval- uate job initiative. The resultant HR flexibility scale bears many similarities to other studies that have recently operationalized this concept from the RBV approach (Bhattacharya et al., 2005). The wording of the HR flexibility items incorporates the suggestions provided by sev- eral scholars (Delery, 1998; Farrell & Hakstian, 2001; Huselid et al., 1997; Wright, Smart, & McMahan, 1995) who state that the features of the workforce can be assessed by a key respondent whose position in the organization enables him or her to rate them. In particular, following Huselid et al. (1997), items in our questionnaires asked these managers to assess the  extent  to  which  employees  in  this  department  currently  possess  the  capabilities  and attributes listed on a scale ranging from 1 (applies to very few employees) to 7 (applies to most of the employees). In this study, we represent HR flexibility as a latent factor that cap- tures the intercorrelations between the previous dimensions. Concerning organizational performance and in accordance with the description of the unit of analysis in our study, we endeavored to use measures that are more directly related to the commercial department rather than firm performance indicators where other variables (e.g., market trends or competitors movements) may contaminate the results (Challis, Samson, & Lawson, 2005). Specifically, given the close interaction between employees in this area and the firm’s customers, we included customer service effectiveness as an indicator of perfor- mance. Prior studies in the HRM field have used this measure (e.g., Borucki & Burke, 1999; Liao & Chuang, 2004; Youndt et al., 1996), and it refers to the extent to which relationships with customers are efficient and customers’ needs and expectations are fulfilled. As shown in  the  appendix,  the  performance  measures  used  in  our  research  are  relative  because  we asked informants to assess their performance over the past 3 years as compared with that of their competitors (Delaney & Huselid, 1996). In  addition,  we  considered  organizational  size  and  sector  as  control  variables  that  can account for an association between HPWS and performance (Gerhart, Wright, McMahan, & Snell, 2000). Following previous studies in the HRM field, we measured size as the loga- rithmic  transformation  of  the  number  of  employees  (Huselid  et  al.,  1997; Youndt  et  al., 1996).  Regarding  sector,  we  differentiated  between  industrial  and  service  companies (according to the Standard Industrial Classification code) and then created a dichotomous variable, where 1 corresponds to industrial sector companies and 2 to service firms. Beltrán-Martín et al. / Human Resource Flexibility 1021 Results Analytic Procedures We conducted our analyses with structural equation modeling (SEM) using the statistical program EQS 6.1 for Windows (Bentler, 1995). To start with, we carried out a preliminary analysis of our data to assess the issue of common method variance and examine the corre- lations between the variables included in our research. Following this, we estimated the measurement models corresponding to our scales so as to analyze their dimensionality, that is, the relationships between latent and observed vari- ables. In doing so, we estimated a set of confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) that helped us to  verify  the  proposed  structure  for  the  HWPS,  HR  flexibility,  and  organizational  perfor- mance scales. Finally, we tested the structural models corresponding to our hypotheses. In particular, we performed structural models for tests of mediation according to the procedure suggested by Baron  and  Kenny  (1986)  and  Holmbeck  (1997).  This  procedure  involves  estimating  two structural models. The first corresponds to a direct effect model that tests the effect of the predictors on the dependent variables. In the context of our research, this model allows us to test Hypothesis 1 as it involves estimating the direct effect of HPWS on performance (Figure 1). For mediation to exist, the path coefficients in the direct effect model corresponding to the HPWS–organizational performance linkage (γ 1) must be significant to continue to test the mediation effect. The second model is a mediated model that includes the intermediate variable.  This  model  corresponds  to  our  second  hypothesis  and  considers  the  effects  of HPWS  on  HR  flexibility,  the  influence  of  HR  flexibility  on  performance,  and  the  direct effect  of  HPWS  on  performance  (Figure  1).  Furthermore,  to  test  whether  the  mediating effect of HR flexibility is partial or total, we compare the previous mediated model with a constrained model in which the HPWS–performance path (γ 1 in the mediated model) is set to  zero.  This  allows  us  to  examine  whether  the  mediated  model  implies  a  significant improvement in fit over the constrained model. If there is a total mediating effect of HR flex- ibility,  the  addition  of  the  HPWS–performance  path  to  the  constrained  model  should  not improve  the  fit.  Alternatively,  for  total  mediation  to  exist,  the  previously  significant HPWS–performance  in  the  direct  effect  model  (γ 1)  should  be  reduced  to  nonsignificance when the mediator is taken into account in the mediated model (Holmbeck, 1997). Preliminary Analysis and Correlation Matrix As a preliminary step in our analyses, we assessed the issue of common method variance because  a  single  respondent  evaluates  all  the  variables  in  our  research.  According  to Harman’s single-factor test (Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003; Podsakoff & Organ, 1986), if common method variance exists, a single factor will emerge from a factor analysis  of  all  survey  items.  This  test  can  be  performed  using  a  CFA  that  includes  all  items from all the constructs in the study in a factor analysis to determine whether most of 1022 Journal of Management / October 2008 the variance can be accounted for by one general factor (Podsakoff et al., 2003). The results of this CFA (Satorra Bentler χ2 = 212.65; df = 77; p = .00; Bentler-Bonnet Non-Normed Fit Index = 0.76; Comparative Fit Index = 0.79; root mean square error of approximation = 0.10; normed chi-square = 2.76) indicate that common method variance does not exist in our study because these indices show far from acceptable values. Table 1 shows the means, standard deviations of all the variables included in our analy- ses, and the correlations between them. This matrix includes 19 variables corresponding to the  components  of  HPWS  (V1-V4),  HR  flexibility  (V5-V7),  organizational  performance (V8-V14), and control variables (V15-V16). Furthermore, variables V17 (organizational per- formance), V18 (HPWS), and V19 (HR flexibility) derive from averaging the corresponding scale items. Structure of HPWS, HR Flexibility, and Organizational Performance We  used  CFAs  to  evaluate  the  measurement  models  included  in  this  study,  that  is,  to examine the dimensionality of our scales. The purpose of this analysis is to describe how well the observed indicators serve as a measurement instrument for the latent variable, and according to SEM methodology, it is a necessary step before testing the causal relationships between the latent variables. Dimensionality of the HPWS Scale For the HPWS scales, we performed a confirmatory factor analysis for each HPWS dimen- sion. For the selective staffing, comprehensive training, and developmental appraisal scales, the goodness-of-fit indices fell within the commonly accepted limits, thus confirming the unidi- mensionality of these scales, namely, items constituting each HPWS scale represent the same theoretical construct. However, our analyses did not support the unidimensionality of the equi- table reward system scale, with goodness-of-fit indices much too low for a well-fitting model. We  therefore  performed  an  exploratory  factor  analysis  with  the  items  corresponding  to  this scale. The exploratory factor analysis showed that the items load on two different factors (Table 2). As a result, we split the equitable reward systems scale into two subscales: one correspond- ing to the more subjective evaluation of internal and external equity (made up of three items) and the other subscale corresponding to a performance-based pay item. In summary, we considered five components of HPWS for subsequent analyses, namely, selective staffing, comprehensive training, developmental performance appraisal, equitable reward systems, and performance-based pay. In addition, we estimated a CFA on the overall HPWS  scale,  including  all  items  for  all  five  dimensions. This  model  includes  the  HPWS dimensions  as  intercorrelated  latent  variables.  The  fit  indices  corresponding  to  this  CFA show acceptable values (Table 3), thus confirming the proposed dimensionality. To test whether there is internal fit among the HPWS components, we performed a CFA (Wood & Albanese, 1995) including HPWS as a second-order latent factor underlying the first-order latent variables corresponding to the HPWS dimensions (Figure 2). Theory argues for a higher-order factor (HPWS) that is considered accountable for the first-order factors (selective staffing, comprehensive training, developmental performance appraisal, equitable 1   e l b a T   s n o i t a l e r r o C d n a   , s n o i t a i v e D d r a d n a t S   , s n a e M 9 1 V 8 1 V 7 1 V 6 1 V 5 1 V 4 1 V 3 1 V 2 1 V 1 1 V 0 1 V 9 V 8 V 7 V 6 V 5 V 4 V 3 V 2 V 1 V D S M e l b a i r a V 0 0 . 1 * * 1 2 . 0 * * 9 2 . 0 1 1 . 0 5 0 . 0 – * * 6 2 . 0 * * 0 3 . 0 2 1 . 0 * * 8 1 . 0 * * 1 2 . 0 * * 9 2 . 0 * 6 1 . 0 * * 8 7 . 0 * * 7 8 . 0 * * 4 8 0 . 3 1 . 0 * * 5 2 . 0 * * 0 2 . 0 9 0 . 0 1 9 . 0 9 0 . 5 0 0 . 1 * * 8 1 . 0 3 0 . 0 9 0 . 0 3 0 . 0 * * 0 2 . 0 * * 9 1 . 0 2 1 . 0 * * 5 1 . 0 0 1 . 0 3 1 . 0 0 1 . 0 * * 4 2 . 0 * * 8 1 0 . * * 9 6 . 0 * * 7 5 . 0 * * 7 5 . 0 * * 5 6 . 0 9 5 . 0 7 8 . 3 0 0 . 1 4 0 . 0 8 0 . 0 – * * 0 7 . 0 * * 0 7 . 0 * * 2 6 . 0 * * 7 7 . 0 * * 2 8 . 0 * * 6 7 . 0 * * 9 7 . 0 * * 5 2 . 0 * * 6 3 . 0 * 5 1 0 . * 4 1 . 0 * * 1 2 . 0 0 1 . 0 6 0 . 0 8 7 . 0 6 5 . 5 0 0 1 . 0 0 . 1 9 0 0 . 0 0 . 1 1 1 . 0 – 0 0 0 – . * * 1 4 . 0 * * 6 3 . 0 * * 6 4 . 0 * * 6 4 . 0 * * 5 4 . 0 * * 6 4 . 0 * * 6 2 . 0 * * 8 2 . 0 4 0 0 . 4 0 . 0 – 1 0 . 0 0 1 0 . 2 0 0 . 8 0 . 0 – 2 0 0 . 2 0 . 0 – 3 0 0 . 9 0 . 0 – 9 0 . 0 – 0 0 0 – . 5 0 0 . 0 0 . 0 – 2 1 0 . 6 0 . 0 – * 4 1 0 . 9 0 0 . 4 0 . 0 – 8 0 . 0 2 1 . 0 1 0 0 . 1 0 . 0 3 0 . 0 1 0 . 0 6 0 . 0 . 1 0 – * * 0 2 0 . 1 0 . 0 – 5 0 . 0 0 1 0 – . 2 0 . 1 7 6 . 5 — — 4 0 1 . 9 5 5 . e z i s   l a n o i t a z i n a g r O   . 6 1 V l a n o i t a z i n a g r O   . 7 1 V y l k c i u q   s r e m o t s u c r o t c e S   . 5 1 V e c n a m r o f r e p   h g i H   . 8 1 V e c r u o s e r   n a m u H   . 9 1 V s m e t s y s   k r o w e c n a m r o f r e p y t i l i b i x e l f 0 0 . 1 * * 2 3 . 0 * * 2 4 . 0 * * 9 4 . 0 * * 4 4 . 0 * * 6 4 . 0 * * 3 2 . 0 * * 3 3 . 0 * * 2 2 . 0 * 7 1 . 0 * * 1 2 . 0 * * 1 2 . 0 * * 8 1 . 0 4 0 . 1 5 5 . 5 r o i v a h e b   r e m o t s u c s n r e t t a p g n i h c a o r p p A   . 4 1 V . s m e t i   e l a c s   g n i d n o p s e r r o c   e h t   g n i g a r e v a   m o r f   e v i r e d   ) y t i l i b i x e l f   e c r u o s e r   n a m u h (     9 1 V d n a   , ) s m e t s y s   k r o w   e c n a m r o f r e p   h g i h (   8 1 V   , ) e c n a m r o f r e p   l a n o i t a z i n a g r o (   7 1 V   s e l b a i r a V : e t o N . 1 0 .   < p * *   . 5 0 .   < p * 1023 0 0 . 1 * * 8 3 . 0 * * 2 4 . 0 * * 2 3 . 0 * * 2 3 . 0 5 0 . 0 * * 9 1 . 0 6 0 . 0 * * 8 1 . 0 * * 8 1 . 0 6 0 . 0 9 0 . 0 4 1 . 1 4 3 . 5 s e c i v r e s   d n a   s t c u d o r p s r e m o t s u c   o t   d e r e f f o o t   s t n e m t s u j d A   . 3 1 V 0 0 . 1 * * 3 6 . 0 * * 7 4 . 0 * * 8 5 . 0 * 7 1 . 0 * * 1 2 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * 5 6 . 0 * * 4 6 . 0 * * 1 2 . 0 * * 5 2 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * 5 6 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * 0 2 . 0 * * 9 1 . 0 * * 3 2 . 0 * * 6 3 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * 4 6 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * 7 5 0 . * * 5 2 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * 7 1 . 0 2 0 . 0 0 1 . 0 8 0 . 0 * * 8 1 . 0 3 1 . 0 0 0 . 1 4 0 . 0 * * 0 2 . 0 * * 2 2 . 0 * * 8 2 . 0 1 1 . 0 * * 3 2 . 0 * * 0 2 . 0 7 0 . 0 4 0 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * 6 2 . 0 2 1 0 . 4 0 . 0 * * 6 1 . 0 * * 8 1 . 0 6 0 . 0 * * 8 1 . 0 6 0 . 0 * 3 1 . 0 2 0 . 0 4 0 . 0 9 0 . 0 4 0 . 0 0 0 . 1 * * 1 4 . 0 7 0 . 1 6 3 . 4 0 0 1 . 6 8 0 . 4 2 3 . * * 6 2 . 0 * * 0 2 . 0 1 1 . 0 8 0 . 0 6 0 . 0 3 0 . 0 1 0 . 0 8 7 . 0 6 7 . 0 1 3 . 1 5 0 . 1 2 9 . 0 6 0 . 1 5 9 . 0 0 3 . 4 2 1 . 4 7 9 . 4 9 2 . 5 1 0 . 5 3 5 . 5 8 6 . 5 4 0 . 0 8 9 . 0 4 6 . 5   n o i t a c i n u m m o c   r e m o t s u c 0 0 . 0 5 0 . 1 9 4 . 5 f o   e g n a r   t n e m e v o r p m I   . 2 1 V s t n i a l p m o c   r e m o t s u c n i   n o i t c u d e R   . 1 1 V m e t s y s   s d r a w e r   e l b a t i u q E   . 4 V l a s i a r p p a   e c n a m r o f r e p l a t n e m p o l e v e D   . 3 V y t i l i b i x e l f   l a n o i t c n u F   . 5 V y t i l i b i x e l f   r o i v a h e B   . 7 V y t i l i b a e l l a m   l l i k S   . 6 V g n i f f a t s   e v i t c e l e S   . 1 V e v i s n e h e r p m o C   . 2 V g n i n i a r t n o i t c a f s i t a s   r e m o t s u c n o i t n e t e r   r e m o t s u C   . 9 V n i   s t n e m e v o r p m I   . 8 V n i   s t n e m e v o r p m I   . 0 1 V 1024 Journal of Management / October 2008 Exploratory Factor Analysis of the Equitable Reward System Scale: Item Loadings Variable Factor 1 Factor 2 Table 2 How would you rate pay levels in this unit relative to other firms?

This  model  essentially  has  the  same  factor  structure  as  the  aforementioned  model  with Beltrán-Martín et al. / Human Resource Flexibility 1025 Figure 2 High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) Second-Order Confirmatory Factor Analysis HPWS SELECTIVE STAFFING COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING DEVELOPMENTAL PERFORMANCE EQUITABLE REWARD SYSTEMS PERFORMANCE-BASED PAY HPWS  as  intercorrelated  latent  variables.  However,  the  higher-order  factor  (HPWS)— namely, second-order factor—is hypothesized as accounting for or explaining all variance and covariance related to the first-order factors. The first-order factors now operate as depen- dent  variables,  which  means  that  their  variances  and  covariances  are  no  longer  estimated parameters in the model. The CFA depicted in Figure 2 hypothesizes that (a) HPWS can be conceptualized in terms of four factors (selective staffing, comprehensive training, develop- mental  performance  appraisal,  equitable  reward  systems)  and  one  observable  indicator (performance-based pay), (b) each observed variable will have a nonzero loading on the fac- tor it was designed to measure and zero loadings for all other factors, (c) error terms associ- ated  with  each  observed  variable  will  be  uncorrelated,  (d)  the  first-order  factors  will  be correlated, (e) covariation among the first-order factors and the observable variable will be explained fully by their regression onto the second-order factor. An appropriate fit for this model implies that such variation and covariation is accounted for  by  the  second-order  factor,  which  according  to  the  idea  of  fit  as  covariation,  lends 1026 Journal of Management / October 2008 Human Resource (HR) Flexibility Second-Order Confirmatory Factor Analysis Figure 3 HR FLEXIBILITY  FUNCTIONAL FLEXIBILITY SKILL MALLEABILITY BEHAVIOR FLEXIBILITY support to the existence of internal fit among the HPWS dimensions (Venkatraman, 1989). This model shows a good fit, as indicated by the χ2 and the fit indices (Table 3). This result can be interpreted as evidence of an underlying HPWS approach that explains any associa- tion that may exist between the set of practices associated with HPWS, therefore verifying the existence of an internal fit among the HPWS dimensions. We  evaluated  the  reliability  of  the  HPWS  scales  through  a  composite  reliability  (c.r.) index, which is often applied in research using SEM (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). This index takes into account the relative importance of each indicator in the factor to which it belongs and shows values of 0.56 for the selective staffing scale, 0.74 for comprehensive training, 0.66 for developmental performance appraisal, and 0.54 for the first subscale of equitable reward systems. To reduce the complexity of our structural models for tests of direct and mediated effects, we considered it appropriate to reduce the items corresponding to each HPWS dimension into a single value by calculating the mean value of these items. The resulting five variables act as observable indicators of a first-order factor corresponding to HPWS. Dimensionality of the HR Flexibility Scale Regarding the HR flexibility scale, we first verified the unidimensionality of each flexi- bility  dimension  by  estimating  three  single-factor  CFAs,  which  showed  appropriate  fit indices. We then estimated a CFA comprising the three HR flexibility dimensions as interre- lated latent variables shows a good fit (Table 3). Composite reliability indices are higher than 0.7 for the three scales. Similarly to HPWS, we assume that there is an underlying HR flexi- bility higher-order factor that captures the intercorrelations among the flexibility dimensions. Beltrán-Martín et al. / Human Resource Flexibility 1027 Figure  3  depicts  a  second-order  HR  flexibility  confirmatory  factor  analysis  measurement model. The single-headed arrows leading from the second-order factor of HR flexibility to each of its first-order factors (functional flexibility, skill malleability, behavior flexibility) indicate the prediction of these dimensions from the higher-order HR flexibility factor. Fit statistics associated with this model verify the proposed structure of the HR flexibil- ity  construct  (Table  3).  We  also  reduced  the  items  corresponding  to  each  HR  flexibility dimension into a single value by calculating the mean value of these items. Dimensionality of the Organizational Performance Scale Finally,  the  CFA  with  the  seven  performance  indicators  (Table  3)  confirms  that  these items belong to a single factor, with high reliability (c.r. = 0.86). Testing the Structural Models As regards the estimation of the structural models corresponding to our hypotheses, the χ2 for the direct effect model is not statistically significant and the values of the fit indices fall within the commonly accepted limits (Table 4). The results confirm that once the con- trol variables have been introduced in the equations, the value of the structural parameter γ 1 corresponding to the influence of HPWS on performance is statistically significant with a value of 0.27, as shown in the standardized solution of this model (Table 5). Thus, our analy- ses demonstrate that HPWS impact organizational performance, corroborating Hypothesis 1 and lending support to previous studies that demonstrate the relevance of adopting HPWS to firm success (e.g., Delaney & Huselid, 1996; Huselid, 1995; Huselid et al., 1997; Koch & McGrath,  1996).  In  addition,  because  we  operationalized  HPWS  as  a  latent  variable,  our results highlight the positive effects of a synergistic system of HPWS practices (i.e., show- ing internal fit) on performance. The results of this model indicate that there is a relationship between HPWS and performance, which is a necessary condition for estimating the medi- ated model, corresponding to Hypothesis 2. The estimation of the mediated model also shows a good fit, according to the values of the χ2 and the fit indices (Table 4). Structural coefficients corresponding to this model appear in Table 6 and Figure 4. Of crucial interest is the fact that HPWS significantly affect HR flex- ibility (γ 1 = 0.31), which confirms the mediating role of HR flexibility in the HPWS–performance relationship, as predicted in Hypothesis 2. 4 = 0.40) and HR flexibility influences firm performance (β We then compared this model with a model in which the HPWS–performance linkage is constrained to zero. The fit indices for the constrained model appear in Table 4. A χ2 differ- ence test between these two models reveals that the difference in the χ2 is not statistically significant  (p =  .11).  Hence,  the  HPWS–performance  relationship  in  the  mediated  model does  not  significantly  improve  the  fit  of  the  constrained  model,  thus  evidencing  the  total mediating effect of HR flexibility in this model. In  addition,  we  observe  that  when  HR  flexibility  is  introduced  in  the  equation  (in  the mediated model), both the structural coefficient corresponding to the direct effect of HPWS 1028 Journal of Management / October 2008 Table 4 Fit Indices for the Structural Models Model χ2 b SB Direct effect 92.99 df 75 model Mediated model 145.73 115 Constrained 148.31 116 model p .08 .03 .02 Bentler- Bonnet Non- Normed Fit Index .96 .95 .95 Comparative Fit Index Root Mean Square Error of Approximation Normed Chi-Square .97 .96 .96 .03 .03 .04 1.24 1.27 1.28 Standardized Solution for the Direct Effect Model Table 5 High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) Organizational Performance Errors .94 .95 .62 .95 .98 .62 .66 .56 .69 .88 .79 .80 .79 .76 .83 .72 .48 .61 .59 .35 .32 .78 .31 .20 Variable Selective staffing Comprehensive training Developmental performance appraisal Equitable rewards system Performance-based pay Improvements in customer satisfaction Customer retention Improvements in customer communication Reduction customer complaints Improvement in range of products and services offered to customers Adjustments to customer behavior patterns Approaching customers quickly Organizational performance = 0.27* HPWS – 0.08 SECTOR + 0.03 SIZE + 0.96 *p < .05. Beltrán-Martín et al. / Human Resource Flexibility 1029 Standardized Solution for the Mediated Model Table 6 Variable Selective staffing Comprehensive training Developmental performance appraisal Equitable rewards system Performance-based pay Functional flexibility Skill malleability Behavior flexibility Improvements in customer satisfaction Customer retention Improvements in customer communication Reduction customer complaints Improvement in range of products and services offered to customers High Performance Work Systems (HPWS) Human Resource (HR) Flexibility Organizational Performance Errors .35 .35 .73 .34 .19 .94 .94 .68 .94 .98 .81 .27 .75 .62 .65 .56 .69 .88 .59 .96 .66 .78 .76 .83 .72 .48 Adjustments to customer behavior patterns Approaching customers quickly HR flexibility = 0.40** HPWS + 0.92 ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE = 0.16 HPWS +0.31** HR FLEXIBILITY − 0.09 SECTOR +0.03 SIZE +0.92 .61 .59 .79 .81 **p < .05. **p < .01. on performance and its statistical significance diminish, leading to a nonsignificant effect of HPWS on the dependent variable (γ 1= 0.16). This result can be also interpreted as evidence of a total mediating effect of HR flexibility in the relationship between HPWS and perfor- mance.  The  mediated  model  contribution  to  the  HPWS–performance  linkage  lies  in  the analysis of HR flexibility as an intermediate mechanism that explains the relationship and that helps to enhance the information provided by the direct effect model. Discussion We found evidence for our sample of companies that HPWS have a positive influence on firm performance. These results support the strategic relevance of HPWS for the firm and coincide with previous empirical studies in the field (e.g., Arthur, 1994; Huselid et al., 1997). However, we assume that the direct effect of HPWS on organizational performance may be due to the existence of intermediate variables that are affected by HPWS and that in turn 1030 Journal of Management / October 2008 Figure 4 Results of the Mediated Model Sector Size –0.09 0.03 HPWS 0.16 ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE 0.40∗∗ 0.31∗∗ HR FLEXIBILITY  Note: HPWS = high performance work systems; HR = human resource. *p < .05. **p < .01. influence organizational performance. By modeling these intervening variables along with their antecedents, researchers can avoid omitted variables and certain threats that accompany such  omissions  (e.g.,  overestimates  of  HPWS  on  organizational  performance)  (Bagozzi, 1994;  Becker  &  Huselid,  2006).  This  concern  has  guided  recent  empirical  studies  in  the HRM field that try to explore what happens between HPWS and organizational performance (e.g., Park et al., 2003; Ramsay et al., 2000). Similarly to the studies mentioned earlier, our work is embedded in the “next generation” of human resource management and offers a deeper study of how and why HPWS affect organizational performance (Wright, 2003). In particular, we demonstrate the relevance of HR  flexibility  as  a  mediator  variable  between  HPWS  and  organizational  performance. According to our results, when we introduce HR flexibility in the mediated model, the effect of HPWS on organizational performance becomes statistically insignificant. This result can be  interpreted  as  meaning  that  HPWS  mainly  exert  their  influence  on  firm  performance through HR flexibility. In other words, HPWS no longer affect organizational performance when HR flexibility has been controlled for. Therefore, HR flexibility is one of the variables that contribute to a deeper insight into the processes through which HPWS influence firm results. We believe that these results contribute to the HPWS literature in several ways. First, support for the hypothesized mediating role of HR flexibility lends credence to the RBV  arguments  highlighting  the  relevance  of  creativity  and  agility  in  organizational resources  for  the  firm’s  performance  (Sanchez,  1997,  2004).  Our  work  goes  beyond  the adaptive concept of HRM, which assumes that firms have an a priori strategy and the main Beltrán-Martín et al. / Human Resource Flexibility 1031 challenges lie in employee contribution to strategy implementation (Colbert, 2004). The tra- ditional adaptive vision justifies the relevance of aspects such as employees’ commitment to the firm’s goals or their current skill base as intermediate variables between HPWS and orga- nizational  performance,  which  was  the  focus  of  prior  empirical  studies  (e.g.,  Moynihan et al., 2001; Ramsay et al., 2000). However, from the RBV perspective, researchers should also consider questions related to employees’ flexibility in explaining the reason why HPWS impact firms’ outcomes. Results concerning the indirect effect of HPWS on organizational performance through HR flexibility in our study confirm this belief and also lend support for critical theoretical studies in the HRM literature, which proposes that HR flexibility is one of the mechanisms through which HPWS affect firm performance (e.g., Guest, 1987; Wright & Snell, 1998). Second, prior empirical evidence has not fully clarified the processes between HPWS and organizational performance in that it has only found partial or weak mediating effects (e.g., Katou & Budhwar, 2006; Park et al., 2003; Ramsay et al., 2000; Sun et al., 2007). Along with our results, HR flexibility has to date been an omitted mediating variable that can comple- ment  prior  empirical  evidence  and  help  researchers  improve  the  information  available  in their  models  and  therefore  advance  the  examination  of  the  intermediate  mechanisms between HPWS and measures of firm performance. Third, the estimation of the mediated model corresponding to Hypothesis 2 provides some partial results that deserve mention. On one hand, we observed that the effect of HR flexibility on organizational performance is positive and statistically significant. This result confirms that as employees show flexibility at work, by manifesting flexibility in skills and behaviors, the firm’s results increase. Our conclusions complement prior discussions on the positive effects of HR flexibility for firm performance, most of which had to date arisen at a theoretical level (e.g., Campbell, 2000; Wright & Snell, 1998). On the other hand, the second partial result stemming from our mediating model refers to the impact that HPWS have on HR flexibility, as recent stud- ies in the field suggest (Bhattacharya et al., 2005). This result confirms the ideas provided by earlier proponents of HPWS in that one of the consequences of HPWS in terms of employees’ performance at work is an improvement in their flexibility (e.g., Guest, 1987). Fourth, we aim to integrate the individual- and organizational-level approaches to study- ing HR flexibility by recognizing that HR flexibility arises out of individual skills and behav- iors that can be fostered by HPWS as a set of human resource practices consciously designed and implemented by the firm. Moreover, our research demonstrates that both the content and process effect of human resource management that Bhattacharya et al. (2005) suggested can appear simultaneously in the firm. According to these authors, HR flexibility is an indicator of  the  firm’s  ability  to  react  and  adapt  to  changing  conditions  (process  effect),  whereas HPWS represent the existence of specific practices in the firm that are associated with orga- nizational performance (content effect). Our research verifies that both of these aspects and their interrelations (i.e., influence of HPWS on HR flexibility) are essential to attain supe- rior organizational performance. Fifth, the current study contributes to the HR flexibility literature by adopting a multidi- mensional definition of HR flexibility from the RBV premises that extends the conceptual- izations proposed by previous scholars (e.g., Kara, Kayis, & O’Kane, 2002; Shafer et al., 2001). By considering questions such as skill malleability, the RBV perspective introduces 1032 Journal of Management / October 2008 a proactive element into the HR flexibility concept, focused on the change-initiating role of employees  that  allows  organizations  to  anticipate  future  external  changes.  HR  flexibility from  the  RBV  differs  from  previous  conceptualizations  of  workforce  flexibility,  which mainly focus on employee versatility or functional flexibility (Karuppan, 2004; Molleman & Slomp, 1999) and therefore on employees’ ability to move or reallocate once a triggering episode has occurred. This definition of HR flexibility has been defended from a theoretical perspective (RBV), and our research together with that of Bhattacharya et al. (2005) provide initial attempts to introduce this measure into empirical researches. Sixth, this work is one of the first to examine the intermediate mechanisms that explain the relevance of HPWS for firm outcomes in the Spanish context, where empirical research has mainly focused on the direct effects between these variables (e.g., De Saá & García, 2001; Ordiz, 2004; Peña & Hernández, 2006; Rodríguez, 2003) without providing much information about the causalities involved. In addition, and taking into account the unit of analysis in the present study, our research verifies the relevance to firm success of employees from the com- mercial area. This finding is consistent with the suggestions of MacKenzie, Podsakoff, and Ahearne (1998), who highlighted the relevance for firms of flexibility in this particular group of employees. Employees in commercial departments shape the nature of the interdependences between  the  organization  and  its  customers,  which  has  emerged  as  a  competitive  factor  in Spanish firms (Kuster & Canales, 2006; Verano, Melián, & García, 2006). Finally, we operationalize HPWS as a latent factor, recognizing that the complementari- ties among the HPWS practices rather than isolated HPWS components influence HR flex- ibility and in turn organizational performance (Ichniowski et al., 1997). We represent HPWS as a latent variable that captures the congruence between several human resource practices. These  results  are  similar  to  findings  of  previous  studies,  such  as  De  Menezes  and Wood (1996),  MacDuffie  (1995),  or Youndt  et  al.  (1996),  that  demonstrated  the  existence  of  a common factor underlying the use of particular human resource practices. In this vein, our study complements prior empirical studies on the intermediate mechanisms (e.g., Fey et al., 2000; Paul & Anantharaman, 2003), which examined isolated relationships among HPWS practices, employee outcomes, and performance. Managerial Implications Our study has implications for managers. Results on the mediating model demonstrate that HR flexibility is a relevant element that explains why HPWS enhance organizational performance.  Our  research  implies  that  managers  are  able  to  verify  whether  or  not  their firm’s human resource strategy is contributing to firm performance by observing changes in employee flexibility. According to our results, even if the HR strategy does not show a direct causal connection with organizational performance, it can significantly influence organiza- tional outcomes indirectly, through HR flexibility. When managers implement new human resource strategies, they should take into account that variables related to employee flexibil- ity  mediate  the  effect  of  HPWS  on  firm  performance.  If  this  is  the  case,  managers  are encouraged to check the design of the human resource strategies implemented in the firm by taking  the  most  appropriate  approach  of  targeting  HR  investments  in  those  practices  that Beltrán-Martín et al. / Human Resource Flexibility 1033 influence HR flexibility. In a related vein, a further notable finding of our study is the simul- taneous effect of HPWS components that influence HR flexibility, which is in accordance with Ostroff and Bowen’s (2000) suggestions that the stronger (i.e., internally consistent) the human resource system is, the more significant effects it will have for employee outcomes. These results provide several orientations to managers when selecting the human resource practices that work together and that can benefit the firm’s results through HR flexibility. Another relevant finding of interest for managers is the need to expand the job perfor- mance concept in the firm by including HR flexibility–related questions, such as employee abilities to engage in broad, open-ended, and interdependent roles that differ from a tradi- tional conception of job performance centered on the effective performance of a set of spec- ified tasks (Campbell, 2000; Parker, 2000). Aspects such as the provision of new ideas or the ability to learn should become part of the labor performance notion (Ilgen & Pulakos, 1999; Murphy, 1999). This question also has implications for the design of specific HR procedures. In particular, we recommend including employee flexibility indicators as additional effective- ness criteria used in the performance appraisal processes. Similarly, the relevance of HR flex- ibility in the HPWS–organizational performance relationship recommends the consideration of employee flexible features when recruiting new employees, for example through the exam- ination of the candidate’s willingness to adapt to new circumstances in the staffing processes by using psychological tests or in-depth interviews. Our study employs a measure of the HR flexibility concept that is theoretically driven, grounded, and integrative, which can be useful in the HR audit processes aimed at evaluat- ing the efficacy of the human resource function when promoting employee flexibility. This measure can provide valuable information for firms, enabling them to more easily identify where improvements may be needed in the flexibility of the workforce. Limitations and Directions for Future Research This study has certain limitations that should be highlighted. As regards the methodology used in the empirical research, we only considered the opinions of one person (commercial manager) on employee flexibility. Future research might compare this measure of HR flexi- bility with employees’ self-rating evaluations of their own flexibility. Moreover, this article focuses on a single employee outcome (HR flexibility) as a medi- ator variable, thus ignoring the potential interrelationships between this variable and other relevant employee outcomes, such as employee commitment, skills, or job satisfaction. As Evans and Genadry (1999) noted, future studies should analyze the relevance of HPWS on the  tensions  that  need  to  be  managed  as  organizations  wrestle  with  achieving  favorable returns in the current context while preparing appropriately for challenges of the new one. That is, an interesting angle would be to observe how the relevance of HR flexibility as a mediating  variable  varies  when  combined  with  other  employee  outcomes.  Hence,  further questions emerge, such as: Are employees who perform well in a set of established tasks equally ready to face challenging external conditions? Does proficiency in the performance of daily jobs constitute a source of motivation for employees to engage in adaptive roles? The comparison between the reactive and proactive sides of employee performance would 1034 Journal of Management / October 2008 contribute  to  advancing  understanding  of  the  relevance  of  employee  outcomes  in  the HPWS–firm performance linkage. In  addition,  the  mediating  model  that  we  propose  refers  to  employees  in  commercial departments. Although  this  is  a  relevant  group  of  employees  in  modern  firms  (Slater  & Olson, 2000), these analyses should be replicated in other organizational areas. The increas- ing challenges that employees in the commercial function have to face in their daily tasks (Ingram, 2004; Román et al., 2002; Wotruba, 1996) can justify the finding that HPWS only influence performance through HR flexibility (i.e., that a total mediating effect of HR flexi- bility exists). By assessing the proposed relationships in different functions within the firm, researchers could determine whether the relevance of HR flexibility as a mediator mecha- nism depends on employees’ positions in the firm or the characteristics of their job. This question reveals a need to consider environmental dynamism in the proposed model because this  variable  determines  the  relevance  of  HR  flexibility  for  firm  performance.  Thus,  the replication of the model in other settings can help to advance in the consideration of HR flex- ibility as a mediator variable. Future research could include the environmental characteris- tics as moderator variables in the proposed model. Moreover, we believe that further efforts should be made to reach a consensus on which specific practices define HPWS as well as the importance of considering “bundles” of prac- tices  in  this  debate. A  shift  from  a  practice-oriented  to  a  bundle-oriented  perspective  of HPWS would provide a more global interpretation of this strategy, which can help to inte- grate discrepancies identified in previous conceptualizations of HPWS. Finally, we suggest analyzing the tensions between the HR flexibility concept presented in our research and other definitions of the term to clarify the relevance of HR flexibility as a mediator variable in the HPWS–organizational performance linkage. By taking the RBV as the framework for defining HR flexibility, this concept is conceived in our study as an internal feature of the firm. However, reality shows us that not all firms have faith in this approach. A large proportion of firms rely on temporary contracts and part-time work as the predominant  approach  in  fostering  competitiveness  through  HR  flexibility.  This  second approach of HR flexibility consists of human resource practices that seek numerical flexi- bility  (Atkinson,  1984;  McIlroy,  Marginson,  &  Regalia,  2004;  Michie  &  Sheehan,  2001, 2005; Valverde et al., 2000). Although the two HR flexibility approaches are conceptually different, the issue of whether they are mutually exclusive in business practice has still not been resolved (Cappelli & Newmark, 2004; Kalleberg, 2001; Lepak et al., 2003; Lepak & Snell, 2002; Tüselmann, 1996) and scholars should determine whether they are complemen- tary or exclusive as mediating variables in the proposed model. Beltrán-Martín et al. / Human Resource Flexibility 1035 Appendix Questionnaire Measurement Scales High Performance Work Systems Selective Staffing • How extensive is the employee selection process for a job in this department?
