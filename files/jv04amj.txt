EMPLOYEES' GOAL ORIENTATIONS, THE QUALITY OF  LEADER-MEMBER EXCHANGE, AND THE OUTCOMES OF JOB  PERFORMANCE AND JOB SATISFACTION  ONNE JANSSEN  NICO W. VAN YPEREN  University of Groningen  As hypothesized, data from 170 employees of a Dutch firm showed that the quality of  leader-member exchange mediated positive relationships between a mastery orienta  tion and leader-rated in-role job performance, leader-rated innovative job perfor  mance, and job satisfaction. In contrast, a performance orientation was negatively  related or unrelated to those outcomes. These findings suggest that employees with  stronger mastery orientations are more effective on the job because they tend to  establish higher-quality exchanges with their supervisors.  Important and recurring questions in organiza  tional science are why employees perform well in  their jobs and why they are satisfied with their jobs.  Achievement goal theory and research suggest that  employees' job performance and job satisfaction  depend on their goal orientations (e.g., Farr, Hof  mann, & Ringenbach, 1993; Phillips & Gully, 1997;  Van Yperen & Janssen, 2002). Goal orientations are  believed to create different perceptual-cognitive  frameworks for how individuals approach, inter  pret, and respond to achievement situations (e.g.,  Barron & Harackiewicz, 2000; Duda, 2001; Dweck,  1999; Pintrich, 2000; Van Yperen, 2003). Most at  tention in the achievement goal tradition has been  given to two goal orientations: a mastery orienta  tion and a performance orientation. A mastery  orientation focuses on developing competence,  gaining skill, and doing one's best, whereas a per  formance orientation focuses on establishing one's  superiority over others.  To date, achievement goal research has been pre  dominantly focused on exploring individual cogni  tion, affect, and behavior related to task engage  ment and task performance in individual task  settings (e.g., Barron & Harackiewicz, 2000; Button,  Mathieu, & Zajac, 1996; Elliot, 1999; Farr et al.,  1993; Ford, Smith, Weissbein, Gully, & Salas, 1998;  Phillips & Gully, 1997; Pintrich, 2000; Van Yperen,  2003a). Surprisingly, little attention has been given  to the question of how goal orientations influence  individuals in the way they interpret and respond  to the interpersonal context of achievement situa  tions. In most work and organizational settings,  employees do not act in isolation but interact with  colleagues, supervisors, or customers to perform  their job duties. Employees differing in goal orien  tations are likely to differ in the way they develop  and maintain relationships with other actors in  their work context. According to leader-member  exchange (LMX) theory (for reviews, see Gerstner  and Day [1997] and Graen and Uhl-Bien [1995]),  each employee establishes a unique social ex  change relationship with his or her supervisor, and  the quality of this leader-member exchange is gen  erally found to be positively related to job perfor  mance and job attitudes.  In the present study, we aimed to develop and  test the idea that goal orientations affect how em  ployees develop and maintain social exchanges  with their supervisors. More specifically, we argue  that mastery orientations cause employees to estab  lish high-quality exchanges with their leaders,  whereas performance orientations keep employees  from establishing high-quality exchanges with their  supervisors. In turn, the quality of leader-member  exchange helps employees to be effective on the job  in terms of inrole performance, innovative per  formance, and satisfaction. Thus, we combined  achievement goal theory and leader-member ex  change theory to propose that the interpersonal  mechanism of leader-member exchange mediates  the relationships between employees' goal orienta  tions and the outcomes of job performance and job  satisfaction.  THEORY AND HYPOTHESES  In the following sections, we first discuss extant  theory and research concerning the relationships  between employees' goal orientations, and job per  formance and job satisfaction. We then consider  how a mastery orientation and a performance ori  entation might differently influence employees in  establishing exchange relationships with their su  368 This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:42:36 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2004 Janssen and Van Yperen 369  pervisors. Finally, we theorize on how the quality  of leader-member exchange facilitates employees'  being effective and satisfied on the job.  Goal Orientations and the Outcomes of Job  Performance and Job Satisfaction  Goal orientations are viewed as rather stable per  sonality characteristics fostered by "self-theories"  about the nature and development of attributes  (such as intelligence, personality, abilities, and  skills) people have (Dweck, 1999). As such, a mas  tery orientation stems from the belief that one's  attributes are dynamic and changeable and that  exerting effort leads to performance improvement,  while a performance orientation stems from the  belief that attributes are fixed, concrete, and inter  nal entities. Performance-oriented individuals tend  to believe that working hard does not lead to per  formance improvement. In their view, working  hard indicates low competence, and those who per  form poorly do not have the attributes necessary to  do well in their jobs (Dweck, 1999).  Early research relying on a dichotomous concep  tualization of goal orientation repeatedly showed a  mastery orientation to be more beneficial for a wide  range of task performances than a performance ori  entation (e.g., Button et al., 1996; Farr et al., 1993;  Ford et al., 1998; Phillips & Gully, 1997; Vande  Walle, Brown, Cron, & Slocum, 1999). However,  recent achievement goal research suggests that a  performance orientation may also have beneficial  effects, particularly with regard to actual perfor  mance. To clarify these opposite effects of perfor  mance orientation, Elliot and his associates (e.g.,  Elliot, 1999; Elliot & Church, 1997) proposed a  trichotomous conceptualization of achievement  goals by bifurcating performance orientation into a  performance-approach orientation and a perfor  mance-avoidance orientation (cf. VandeWalle,  1997). They argued that performance-oriented in  dividuals can be motivated either to "outperform"  others and to demonstrate their superiority, or to  avoid failure and to avoid looking incompetent,  respectively. The finding that a performance  approach orientation is associated with superior  performance (e.g., Barron & Harackiewicz, 2000;  Elliot & Church, 1997; Harackiewicz, Barron,  Carter, Letho, & Elliot, 1997) suggests that individ  uals with performance-approach orientations tend  to exert sufficient effort to accomplish their goal of  outperforming others. The tendency to reduce ef  fort after encountering setbacks and difficulty often  associated with performance orientations (e.g.,  Duda, 2001; Dweck, 1999) seems to be more char  acteristic of performance-avoidance-oriented indi  viduals (Barron & Harackiewicz, 2000; Elliot, 1999;  Pintrich, 2000). Mastery goals were also bifurcated  into approach and avoidance versions (Elliot &  McGregor, 2001; Van Yperen, 2003a). That is, indi  viduals endorsing mastery-avoidance goals strive  to avoid deterioration, losing their skill, or leaving  a task incomplete or unmastered, whereas mastery  approach goals are focused on the development of  competence through task mastery (Elliot & McGre  gor, 2001). As such, approach-oriented individuals  tend to pursue beneficial outcomes, whereas avoid  ance-oriented employees tend to avert detrimental  outcomes. The four different types of goal orienta  tions?that is, mastery approach, mastery avoid  ance, performance approach, and performance  avoidance?appear to have different antecedents  and consequences (e.g., Elliot & McGregor, 2001).  However, the different types of goal orientations  can coexist in a person, so that, for example, trying  to attain mastery is not necessarily inconsistent  with striving to outperform others. Thus, people  vary in the extent to which they pursue each of the  four achievement goals.  Because we had no clear hypotheses regarding  the avoidance components of mastery and perfor  mance orientations, we focused exclusively on the  approach versions. That is, we developed and  tested theory proposing that employees with mas  tery-approach orientations are more effective on  the job because of their tendency to establish high  quality exchanges with their supervisors, whereas  employees with performance-approach orienta  tions are less effective because they fail to establish  exchanges of a high quality with their supervisors.  For the remainder of this article, we restrict the use  of the terms "mastery goal" and "performance goal"  to the approach versions of these goal orientations.  As it stands now, achievement goal theory sug  gests that both mastery-oriented and performance  oriented individuals are strongly motivated to meet  their respective performance standards. However,  in work and organizational settings, mastery-ori  ented and performance-oriented employees may  differ in the aspects of job performance they focus  on. Job performance is a broad and complex con  struct comprising two fundamentally different as  pects, namely, in-role job performance mandated  by an organization, and more spontaneous innova  tive work behaviors (Katz, 1964). So far as we  know, no research has been conducted to answer  the question of how the different goal orientations  relate to these fundamentally different aspects of  job performance.  In-role job performance can be defined as actions  specified and required by an employee's job de  scription and thus mandated, appraised, and re This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:42:36 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  370 Academy of Management Journal June  warded by the employing organization. These sets  of rules and procedures make work behavior pre  dictable so that basic organizational tasks can be  coordinated and controlled in order to achieve or  ganizational goals. The proficiency with which em  ployees carry out their work activities and work  roles appears to be an important individual source  of variation in job performance (Borman & Motow  idlo, 1993; Motowidlo & Van Scotter, 1994). Be  cause a mastery orientation creates a tendency to  improve proficiency on the job and to persist effec  tively in the face of obstacles (cf. Dweck, 1999),  mastery-oriented employees can be expected to  meet or even exceed their organization's standards  for in-role job performance. However, we also ex  pected that performance goal orientations would  motivate employees to perform well with respect to  in-role task requirements. A performance goal re  flects the desire to demonstrate superior compe  tence to others. As such, employees with perfor  mance orientations tend to perceive in-role job  requirements as competitive standards that moti  vate them to exert effort in order to outperform  others and to obtain favorable competence judg  ments from their organization's appraisal and re  ward systems. Moreover, performance goal orienta  tions have been argued to cause employees to  rehearse job components and skills until they re  quire little attention and can be performed auto  matically in a very efficient and effective manner  (Steele-Johnson, Beauregard, Hoover, & Schmidt,  2000). Accordingly, the following hypotheses were  formed:  Hypothesis 1. A mastery orientation is posi  tively related to in-role job performance.  Hypothesis 2. A performance orientation is  positively related to in-role job performance.  An organization has to find the right balance  between using rules and procedures to make work  performance predictable and giving employees the  freedom to spontaneously innovate to adapt to  problems, opportunities, and unusual situations  (cf. Jones, 2001; Katz, 1964). Innovative job perfor  mance can be defined as the intentional generation,  promotion, and realization of new ideas within a  work role, work group, or organization in order to  benefit role performance, a group, or an organiza  tion (e.g., Kanter, 1988; Scott & Bruce, 1994; West &  Farr, 1989). A mastery goal orientation can be ex  pected to be an important motivational source for  innovative job performance for several reasons.  First, individuals pursuing mastery goals have a  preference for challenging and complex tasks  (Ames & Archer, 1988; VandeWalle, 1997). Innova  tion is an especially complex and challenging task  encompassing a broad variety of cognitive and so  cial activities, such as generating, promoting, dis  cussing, modifying, and ultimately implementing  creative ideas (Kanter, 1988). Moreover, innovative  job performance concerns the development and ap  plication of something new for which the requisite  knowledge and strategies have yet to be learned.  Research has shown that a mastery goal focuses an  individual's attention on the elaboration and devel  opment of new knowledge and deep processing  strategies leading to effectiveness in complex and  unfamiliar tasks (Elliot & McGregor, 2001; Fisher &  Ford, 1998; Steele-Johnson et al, 2000; Winters &  Latham, 1996).  Second, mastery-oriented employees have per  sonal and intrinsic interest in the tasks they per  form (Barron & Harackiewicz, 2000; Elliot, 1999;  Pintrich, 2000; Van Yperen, 2003a). Creativity is  evoked by the pleasure provided by the tasks them  selves, and the innovation literature emphasizes  that this intrinsic aspect of work motivation is an  essential motivational base for performing innova  tive activities (e.g., Amabile, 1988; Redmond,  Mumford, & Teach, 1993). According to Amabile  (1985, 1988), intrinsic motivation affects innova  tiveness by influencing the likelihood that alterna  tive?and potentially more innovative?response  possibilities will be explored during task engage  ment.  Third, when obstacles such as demanding task  difficulties are encountered, mastery-oriented em  ployees tend to deal with these challenging circum  stances by putting more effort into their jobs  (Dweck, 1999; Farr et al., 1993). As has already  been mentioned above, innovation requires a broad  variety of cognitive and sociopolitical efforts from  individual innovators (e.g., Kanter, 1988). More  over, innovation involves change that may give rise  to resistance because of the insecurity and uncer  tainty it may bring (Frost & Egri, 1991; Janssen,  2003; Jones, 2001). Hence, innovative employees  are likely to meet resistance from other workers in  their work environment who want to prevent inno  vative change. Convincing those workers of the  benefits of innovation can be difficult and demand  ing. Mastery-oriented employees are likely to cope  effectively with such difficulties by putting sub  stantial effort into the job of innovation in order to  identify and apply the strategies needed to succeed  (cf. Dweck, 1999; Farr et al, 1993).  In contrast with a mastery goal orientation, a  performance orientation might be less beneficial for  innovative behaviors on the job. Fisher and Ford  (1998) found that performance orientations cause  individuals to rehearse task strategies and familiar This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:42:36 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2004 Janssen and Van Yperen 371  task components until they become rapid and au  tomatic. Such a focus on practicing job components  can interfere with innovation and learning as indi  viduals possess a fixed number of attentional re  sources that can be allocated to a variety of job  components (e.g., Steele-Johnson et al., 2000). Per  formance-oriented employees tend to devote their  attention to surface processing (Elliot & McGregor,  2001; Elliot et al., 1999) and practicing in-role job  components that may help them to outperform oth  ers. This focus on surface processing and practicing  in-role job components further refines and estab  lishes the existing framework for doing things and  is likely to prevent employees from devoting atten  tional resources to developing innovative ideas for  doing things differently.  Furthermore, performance-oriented employees  have an extrinsic work motivation in the sense that  they tend to define success on the job primarily in  terms of outperforming others and demonstrating  superiority. The task of innovation, however, is an  uncertain and controversial endeavour. That is, the  process and outcomes of innovation are unpredict  able, as progress comes in spurts among unforeseen  delays, setbacks, and costs (e.g., Kanter, 1988).  Moreover, innovation poses a threat to vested in  terests and alternative courses of action and, there  fore, often leads to political problems and failure  (Frost & Egri, 1991; Kanter, 1988). As a conse  quence, employees with performance orientations  may tend to keep away from innovation because  innovative tasks imply the risk of failure, which  would demonstrate their inferiority rather than the  superiority they pursue.  This line of reasoning about the relationship be  tween goal orientation and innovative job perfor  mance led to the following hypotheses:  Hypothesis 3. A mastery orientation is posi  tively related to innovative job performance.  Hypothesis 4. A performance orientation is  negatively related to innovative job perfor  mance.  is in itself indicative of success (Duda, 2001;  Dweck, 1999). In contrast, performance-oriented  individuals believe that working hard signifies low  ability, which makes them uncertain about their  capacities to meet their competitive standards (cf.  Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Van Yperen & Janssen,  2002). Furthermore, mastery-oriented individuals  have predominantly internal loci of perceived con  trol and causality (e.g., Dweck & Leggett, 1988),  whereas performance-oriented individuals typi  cally evaluate task performance on the basis of  social comparison criteria that appear to them to be  largely outside their personal control (cf. Button et  al, 1996; Elliot, 1999; Farr et al., 1993; Philips &  Gully, 1997). The work stress literature has shown  that a lack of control is accompanied by negative  affective outcomes, especially when task require  ments are high (e.g., Karasek & Theorell, 1990; Van  Yperen & Hagedoorn, 2003). Hence, we hypothe  sized that a mastery orientation is positively related  to job satisfaction, whereas a negative relationship  was expected between performance orientation and  job satisfaction.  Hypothesis 5. A mastery orientation is posi  tively related to job satisfaction.  Hypothesis 6. A performance orientation is  negatively related to job satisfaction.  Goal Orientations and the Quality of Leader  Member Exchange  Leader-member exchange (LMX) theory and re  search suggest that the quality of the exchanges that  develop between employees and their leaders are  predictive of performance-related and attitudinal  job outcomes, especially for employees (Gerstner &  Day, 1997; Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995). LMX theory is  unique among leadership theories in its focus on  the dyadic exchange relationships between super  visors and each of their subordinates (Gerstner &  Day, 1997). High-quality exchange relationships  are characterized by mutual trust, respect, and ob  ligation that generate influence between an em  ployee and his or her supervisor. Low-quality  exchange relationship, on the other hand, are char  acterized by formal, role-defined interactions and  predominantly contractual exchanges that result in  hierarchy-based downward influence and distance  between the parties.  Goal orientations may influence how employees  approach, interpret, and establish their relation  ships with their supervisors. Employees with mas  tery goal orientations strive to develop their com  petence, skills, and ability. Given this focus,  supervisors should be of interest as valuable  With regard to the affective outcome of job satis  faction, achievement goal research demonstrates  that mastery-oriented individuals derive more sat  isfaction and enjoyment from their efforts to reach  their goals than performance-oriented individuals  (e.g., Barron & Harackiewicz, 2000; Elliot, 1999;  Harackiewicz et al., 1997; Pintrich, 2000; Van  Yperen & Janssen, 2002). When increased task re  quirements are encountered, mastery-oriented in  dividuals direct extra effort to a task itself. They  tend to view exerting great effort as a desirable  attribute of the self so that, for them, exerting effort This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:42:36 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  372 Academy of Management Journal June  sources of work-related knowledge, information,  and experience that can provide employees with  prospects for skill development and self-improve  ment. Therefore, mastery-oriented employees may  tend to frequently seek social exchanges with their  leaders in order to discuss and learn how to better  deal with emerging problems and opportunities  when performing their jobs. These exchange inter  actions may help employees to succeed in their  goal of improving ability and skill.  Furthermore, given mastery-oriented employees'  intrinsic work motivation and willingness to work  hard, supervisors may provide these employees  with support, decision latitude, and freedom so  that they can initiate, control, and carry out their  tasks without excessive supervision. In turn, em  ployees may reciprocate by working hard, doing  extra tasks needed for performance improvement,  and performing spontaneous and innovative extra  role behaviors going beyond contractual expecta  tions (e.g., Basu & Green, 1997; Howell & Hall  Merenda, 1999; Sparrowe & Liden, 1997; Wayne,  Shore, & Liden, 1997). As such, exchanges between  mastery-oriented employees and their supervisors  are likely to develop to high levels. That is, they  can count on each other for support and loyalty,  share important informational and behavioral re  sources, and base the exchange process on mutual  trust, respect, and obligation (cf. Graen & Uhl-Bien,  1995; Howell & Hall-Merenda, 1999).  In contrast, employees with performance goal  orientations strive to outperform others and to  demonstrate superiority. Given this focus, they  may perceive supervisors as threats, as their higher  rank suggests that their attributes (such as intelli  gence and abilities) are superior to those of the  subordinate employees. Moreover, performance  oriented employees tend to believe that the at  tributes people have are fixed and primarily a prod  uct of innate talent (Dweck, 1999).  Consequently, such employees may see little  possibility of ever showing superior competence in  their relationships with their supervisors. In ex  changes with their supervisors, they will always be  confronted, by definition, with their own inferior  ity. Therefore, employees with performance orien  tations may prefer to restrict their interactions with  their supervisors to the necessary economic ex  change behaviors required and mandated by their  formal employment contracts. Given their extrinsic  work motivation and meaning systems (Dweck,  1999), supervisors might be less willing to provide  performance-oriented employees with decision lat  itude and autonomy for carrying out their tasks.  Thus, leader-member exchanges are likely to be  formal and impersonal and characterized by eco  nomic exchange behaviors and social-emotional  distance between the exchange parties (cf. Graen &  Uhl-Bien, 1995; Howell & Hall-Merenda, 1999).  This theorizing on goal orientations' influence on  how employees establish social exchanges with  their supervisors led to the following hypotheses:  Hypothesis 7. A subordinate's mastery orien  tation is positively related to the quality of  leader-member exchange.  Hypothesis 8. A subordinate's performance  orientation is negatively related to the quality  of leader-member exchange.  Leader-Member Exchange as an Intermediate  Interpersonal Mechanism  Finally, we expected to find that the quality of  leader-member exchange is an interpersonal mech  anism that mediates the relationships between goal  orientation, and job performance and job satisfac  tion. As argued above, mastery orientations cause  employees to establish high-quality exchanges with  their leaders, providing them with opportunities  for skill development and self-improvement. This  proficiency development may help employees to  perform well on in-role job duties.  Furthermore, innovative workers depend on  their supervisors for the information (data, exper  tise, political intelligence), resources (materials,  space, time), and social-political support (endorse  ment, legitimacy, backing) necessary to develop,  protect, and apply their innovative ideas (Kanter,  1988). As outlined above, mastery-oriented em  ployees are likely to receive these resources and  support because they tend to develop high-quality  exchange relationships with their supervisors.  Prior research has found that such a high quality of  leader-member exchange is predictive of innova  tive job performance (e.g., Basu & Green, 1997;  Scott & Bruce, 1994).  The support and autonomy that supervisors may  provide to mastery-oriented employees may also  lead to higher levels of job satisfaction. Employees  who feel a sense of self-determination on the job  see themselves as the origin of and responsible for  work actions and are, therefore, more likely to ex  perience intrinsic rewards and satisfaction from  work (cf. Deci & Ryan, 1985). Moreover, the support  and backing of a supervisor can help employees to  overcome work-related problems and, therefore,  contribute to their job satisfaction. Indeed, previ  ous research has consistently indicated that higher  quality levels of leader-member exchange produce  higher levels of job satisfaction among employees This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:42:36 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2004 Janssen and Van Yperen 373  (e.g., Gerstner & Day, 1997; Green, Anderson, &  Shivers, 1996).  This line of reasoning on the interpersonal mech  anism of leader-member exchange led to the fol  lowing three hypotheses:  Hypothesis 9. Leader-member exchange medi  ates the positive relationship between a subor  dinate's mastery orientation and in-role job  performance.  Hypothesis 10. Leader-member exchange me  diates the positive relationship between a sub  ordinate's mastery orientation and innovative  job performance.  Hypothesis 11. Leader-member exchange me  diates the positive relationship between a sub  ordinate's mastery orientation and job satisfac  tion.  Similarly, low-quality leader-member exchange  may play a mediating role in the relationship be  tween a performance orientation and innovative  job performance. That is, in low-quality exchange  relationships, employees cannot count on their su  pervisors for the extra support and backing needed  to move potentially innovative ideas into reality.  This anticipated lack of support can be expected to  reinforce the tendency of performance-oriented  employees to keep away from risky innovative ac  tivities. In addition, the low levels of support and  autonomy received from their supervisors may  clarify why performance-oriented employees expe  rience relatively low job satisfaction. These argu  ments suggest the following hypotheses:  Hypothesis 12. Leader-member exchange me  diates the negative relationship between a sub  ordinate's performance orientation and inno  vative job performance.  Hypothesis 13. Leader-member exchange me  diates the negative relationship between a  subordinate's performance orientation and job  satisfaction.  Because of the low-quality exchanges between  performance-oriented employees and their supervi  sors, performance-oriented employees can be ex  pected to use sources other than leader-member  exchange to perform in-role job duties well. As  noted earlier, performance orientations may cause  employees to rehearse components and skills until  they require little attention and can be performed  in efficiently and effectively.  METHODS  Sample and Procedures  The relationships between goal orientations,  leader-member exchange, and the outcomes of job  performance and job satisfaction were examined in  a field study conducted in a division of a Dutch  energy supplier. The data were collected as part of  a more general survey of job-related attitudes and  job performance among nonmanagement lower  level employees. These employees performed a  wide range of different jobs in different functions,  including customer service, meter reading, front  office work, back office work, invoicing, collection,  accounting, and call center work. Meetings were  scheduled to inform the employees about the gen  eral purpose of the study, to emphasize confiden  tiality, and to administer questionnaires. All 288  employees were asked to participate in the research  and received questionnaires, which were filled out  during work time and returned via the internal mail  system.  Of the 288 employees who received question  naires, 187 responded by providing "self-reports"  of their goal orientations, leader-member exchange,  and job satisfaction, resulting in a response rate of  65 percent. Since supervisors played a pivotal part  in appraisal and rewards systems, the employees'  job performance was rated by their immediate su  pervisors [n = 14), who filled out a questionnaire  that assessed the in-role and innovative job perfor  mance of their subordinates. Supervisor ratings  were obtained for 170 of the 187 respondents in the  sample.  Of this final sample of 170 respondents, 75 per  cent were male. Their ages ranged from 19 to 61  years, averaging 44.09 years (s.d. = 9.52). The or  ganizational tenure of the participants ranged from  less than 1 year to 41 years, and their average ten  ure was 19.32 years (s.d. = 10.49).  Measures  The items comprising the scales described gen  erally below are detailed in the first two tables, in  the results section.  Goal orientations. Individual differences in goal  orientation were assessed by administering scales  for measuring mastery and performance goal orien  tation developed by Van Yperen (e.g., Van Yperen  & Janssen, 2002). The subjects responded to the  question "I feel most successful in my job when  . . . ," after which they judged 11 mastery and 8  performance orientation items. Responses were  provided on a seven-point scale ranging from 1,  "strongly disagree," to 7, "strongly agree."

Quality of leader-member exchange. This vari  able was assessed using seven items based on the  member versions of leader-member exchange ques  tionnaires developed and used in prior research  (e.g., Liden & Graen, 1980; Scandura & Graen, 1984;  Wayne, Shore, & Liden, 1997). Respondents indi  cated the extent to which the items characterized  the quality of their exchange relationships with  their supervisors (1, "to a very low extent," to 7, "to  a very high extent"; a = .93).  Job performance. We measured in-role job per  formance using Podsakoff and MacKenzie's (1989)  five-item scale for in-role job performance. The im  mediate supervisors of the respondents indicated  the extent to which they agreed or disagreed with  five statements about the quality and quantity of  the respondents' in-role activities (1, "strongly dis  agree," to 7, "strongly agree"; a = .85).  Innovative job performance was assessed using  Janssen's (2000, 2001) nine-item scale of individual  innovation in the workplace, which draws on  Kanter's (1988) work on the stages of innovation.  Three items refer to idea generation, three items to  idea promotion, and the remaining three to idea  realization. Immediate supervisors rated how often  the subjects performed the nine innovative work  behaviors in the workplace (1, "never," to 7, "al  ways"). A high reliability was achieved for the in  novative job performance scale [a = .98).  Job satisfaction. Satisfaction on the job was  measured using a five-item scale developed by  Bacharach, Bamberger, and Conley (1991). This  general job satisfaction scale "emphasizes the  match between expectations and perceived real  ity for broad aspects of the job taken as a whole"  (Bacharach et al., 1991: 45). Appropriate to the  context of this study, this operational definition  of job satisfaction allowed us to examine the ex  tent to which employees' goal orientations on the  job were related to the fulfilment of their job  expectations. The subordinates responded to the  question "How satisfied or dissatisfied are you  with . . ." (1, "very dissatisfied," to 7, "very sat  isfied"; a = .88), after which they judged five  aspects of their jobs.  Covariates. To control for the possibility that  sociodemographic differences in the predictor and  outcome variables might lead to spurious relation  ships, gender (1, "male," 2, "female"), age (in  years), and organizational tenure (in years) were  entered as covariates in the analyses.  RESULTS  Response Bias  From the initial sample of 187 respondents, 17  were excluded as a result of missing supervisor  ratings, leading to a final sample of 170 respon  dents. To test whether the included respondents  systematically differed from the excluded respon  dents with respect to their scores on goal orienta  tion, leader-member exchange, and job satisfaction,  we conducted a multivariate analysis of variance  (MANOVA). The results of the MANOVA did not  demonstrate significant differences, minimizing  concern about potential sampling bias.  Exploratory Factor Analyses  Before testing the hypotheses, we conducted two  exploratory factor analyses in order to get some  evidence for the measures' discriminant validity.  First, the items of the self-reported measures of  mastery orientation, performance orientation, lead  er-member exchange, and job satisfaction were sub  mitted to a principal components analysis with  oblique rotation. As can be seen in Table 1, four  factors emerged with eigenvalues greater than 1,  accounting for 61.84 percent of the variance. Each  item "loaded" on its appropriate factor, with pri  mary loadings exceeding .44 and cross-loadings  lower than .33. Second, the items of the job perfor  mance measures rated by the respondents' supervi  sors were submitted to a principal components  analysis with oblique rotation. As is shown in Ta  ble 2, the two factors that emerged appropriately  represented the in-role and innovative job perfor  mance items, whereby primary loadings exceeded  .68 while cross-loadings were lower than .34. The  two factors had eigenvalues greater than 1 and ac  counted for 83.51 percent of the variance.  Descriptive Statistics and Correlations  Means, standard deviations, and zero-order Pear  son correlations among all variables in this study  are presented in Table 3. As expected, mastery  orientation appeared to be positively correlated to  the mediating variable of leader-member exchange  and to the outcome variables of in-role job perfor  mance, innovative job performance, and job satis  faction. However, no significant zero-order correla  tions were found between performance orientation  and the mediating and outcome variables. As pre  dicted, leader-member exchange was positively re  lated to both in-role and innovative job perfor  mance, and to job satisfaction.

In line with Hypotheses 6 and 8, a perfor  mance orientation was negatively related to job  satisfaction and leader-member exchange.  Furthermore, the quality of leader-member ex  change was hypothesized to mediate the effects of  goal orientation on job performance and job satis  faction. Under the guidelines provided by Baron  and Kenny (1986), mediation is indicated if the  effect of the independent variable (here, goal orien  tation) on the outcome variable (job performance  and job satisfaction) substantially decreases upon  the addition of the mediator (leader-member ex  change) to the model, while the mediator has a  significant, unique effect on the outcome variable.  To test this mediation model, we added a third  step, containing leader-member exchange, to the  regression analyses of the outcome variables. As is  shown in Table 4, when leader-member exchange  was added to the models, the regression coeffi  cients of the relationships between mastery orien  tation and the outcome variables decreased from  .33 (p < .001) in the second step to .24 (p < .01) in  the third step for in-role job performance, from .19  [p < .05) to .09 (n.s.) for innovative job perfor  mance, and from .35 [p < .001) to .26 {p < .001) for  job satisfaction. Moreover, although the effect of  mastery orientation decreased, leader-member ex  change as a mediator had a significant, unique ef  fect on all three outcome variables. With respect to  performance orientation, the regression coefficients  only slightly decreased from -.26 (p < .01) in the  second step to -.22 (p < .01) in the third step for  in-role job performance, and from -.13 (p < .05)  to - .09 (n.s.) for job satisfaction when we added  leader-member exchange to the models.  Finally, to test whether the effect of goal orienta  tion significantly decreased upon the addition of  leader-member exchange, we performed the Sobel  test (Baron & Kenny, 1986; Sobel, 1982). This test  revealed that leader-member exchange mediated  the positive effects of mastery orientation on in-role  job performance (Z = 2.71, p < .01), innovative job  performance (Z = 2.84, p < .01), and job satisfac  tion (Z = 2.74, p < .01). Thus, these results pro  vided full support for Hypotheses 9, 10, and 11.  Leader-member exchange was not found to be a  significant mediator in the relationship between  performance orientation and in-role job perfor  mance (Z = -1.45, n.s.). Furthermore, since perfor  mance orientation was not significantly related to  the outcome variable of innovative job perfor  mance, the results provided no support for Hypoth  esis 12, predicting leader-member exchange to be a  mediator variable in the negative effect of perfor  mance orientation on innovative job performance.  Finally, in line with Hypothesis 13, leader-member  exchange mediated the negative relationship be This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:42:36 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  378 Academy of Management Journal June  tween performance orientation and job satisfaction  (Z = -1.80, p < .05, one-tailed test).  Supplementary Analyses  The modest correlation between mastery and  performance orientations (r = .33, p < .001) indi  cates that trying to attain mastery is not necessarily  inconsistent with striving to outperform others. By  implication, a mastery and a performance goal ori  entation might interact in their effects. Therefore,  we conducted additional hierarchical regression  analyses to detect possible interactions. These re  gressions consisted of three steps. After controlling  for the sociodemographic variables in step 1 and  the "main effects" of the goal orientations in step 2,  we added the third step, which involved the cross  product term of mastery and performance orienta  tion, in order to detect interactive effects. To min  imize problems of multicollinearity and facilitate  interpretation, we centered the predictor variables  before calculating the cross-product term and re  gression statistics (Aiken & West, 1991). The anal  yses showed that mastery and performance orien  tations did not interact in their effects on leader  member exchange (AjR2 = .01, n.s.), innovative job  performance (An2 = .01, n.s.), and job satisfaction  (An2 = .01, n.s.). However, we found an interactive  effect of mastery and performance orientations on  in-role job performance [AR2 = .03, b = .11, p <  .05). To interpret this interaction effect, we re  arranged the total regression equation into simple  regressions of in-role job performance on perfor  mance orientation, given conditional values of  mastery orientation (mean + 1 s.d.; mean - 1 s.d.;  cf. Aiken & West, 1991). As shown in Figure 1, in  the case of a strong mastery orientation, relatively  high levels of in-role job performance were ob  tained regardless of the strength of an individual's  performance orientation [b = ?.05, n.s.). However,  when mastery orientation was weak, performance  orientation had a negative relationship with in-role  job performance {b = -.24, p < .001). These find  ings signify that mastery and performance orienta  tions interacted in such a way that a strong mastery  orientation was needed to buffer the negative effect  of a performance orientation on in-role job perfor  mance (cf. Van Yperen & Janssen, 2002). These  additional results contradicted Hypothesis 2,  which predicts a positive relationship between per  formance orientation and in-role job performance.  In this article, goal orientations are viewed as  rather stable personality characteristics that may  influence employees in the way they establish ex  change relationships with their leaders. However,  alternatively, the quality of leader-member ex  change might be a contextual factor that can impact  the goal orientations of employees. Therefore, we  conducted a series of regression analyses to test  alternative path models in which mastery and per  formance orientations mediated the effects of  leader-member exchange on the outcome variables.  After controlling for the sociodemographic vari  ables in the first step, we found that leader-member  exchange was positively related to in-role job per  formance (Ai?2 = .13, b = .37, p < .001), innovative  job performance (Ai?2 = .10, b = .32, p < .001), and  job satisfaction (An2 = .12, b = .35, p < .001). When  mastery orientation and performance orientation  were added to the equations, the regression coeffi  cients of the relationships between leader-member  exchange and the outcome variables declined only  Effects of Interaction of Performance and Mastery Orientation on In-Role Job Performance  FIGURE 1  In-Role Job Performance  Strong mastery orientation  Weak mastery orientation  Weak Strong  Performance Orientation This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:42:36 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2004 Janssen and Van Yperen 379  modestly, from .37 (p < .001) to .30 (p < .001) for  in-role job performance, from .32 (p < .001) to .30  (p < .001) for innovative job performance, and from  .35 (p < .001) to .28 (p < .001) for job satisfaction.  Additional Sobel tests indicated that neither a mas  tery (Z = 1.11, n.s.) nor a performance orientation  (Z = -0.05, n.s.) mediated the relationship be  tween leader-member exchange and innovative job  performance.  Furthermore, performance orientation had no  significant mediation effects in the regressions of  in-role job performance (Z = 0.22, n.s.) and job  satisfaction (Z = 0.57, n.s.). Only mastery orienta  tion was found to be a modest mediator in the  relationships between leader-member exchange  and the outcome variables of in-role job perfor  mance (Z = 2.19, p < .05) and job satisfaction (Z =  2.47, p < .05). This pattern of results indicated that  the alternative model, in which leader-member ex  change is the independent variable and goal orien  tation is the mediator variable, was inferior to the  research model, in which goal orientation is the  independent variable, and leader-member ex  change is the mediator variable.  Furthermore, as 14 supervisors provided perfor  mance ratings across 170 employees, the data had  potential for bias owing to differences between su  pervisors in performance evaluations. Moreover,  the 170 respondents were nested within 14 organi  zational units led by those 14 supervisors and vary  ing more or less in structure, culture, size, kind of  jobs, technology, and so forth. To consider this  nested data structure and check for possible super  visor and unit effects, we conducted two-level  analyses using the MLwiN computer package  (Goldstein et al., 1998). These two-level analyses  decomposed the total observed variance in the vari  ables of interest into individual-level and group  level residual variances We conducted a two-level  analysis for each of the three outcome variables.  That is, after supervisor and unit effects as well as  the sociodemographic variables had been con  trolled for, mastery orientation, performance orien  tation, and leader-member exchange were added to  the models, to predict the outcome variables. These  two-level analyses provided the same pattern of  results that we obtained from the ordinary hierar  chical regression analyses reported above. That is,  leader-member exchange was again found to medi  ate the positive effects of mastery orientation on  in-role job performance, innovative job perfor  mance, and job satisfaction. Moreover, perfor  mance orientation again interacted with mastery  orientation in predicting in-role job performance.  DISCUSSION  In this study, we developed and tested the idea  that a mastery orientation helps an employee to  establish a high-quality exchange with his or her  leader, while a performance orientation hinders  leader-member exchange of a high quality. In turn,  the quality of leader-member exchange was as  sumed to clarify why employees with stronger mas  tery orientations are more effective on the job than  those with stronger performance orientations. As  expected, the present survey results revealed that  a mastery orientation was positively related to in  role job performance, innovative job performance,  and job satisfaction, and that the quality of leader  member exchange mediated these relationships.  In contrast, their performance goal orientations  led employees to establish low-quality social ex  changes with their supervisors. A lower quality  of leader-member exchange was associated with  lower levels of in-role and innovative job perfor  mance, and with lower job satisfaction. However,  leader-member exchange was found to be only a  mediator in the negative relationship between per  formance orientation and job satisfaction. Our data  provided no evidence that a low-quality leader  member exchange was the interpersonal mecha  nism that could clarify the negative relationship  between performance orientation and job perfor  mance.  These results provide new insights for the  achievement goal theory, in which the interper  sonal context of achievement situations has been  largely neglected. In organizational settings, super  visors are an organization's most salient agents for  employees, as they principally determine the im  portant job products of subordinates. This study  provides theoretical logic and empirical evidence  that employees' goal orientations are related to the  quality of social exchanges they develop and main  tain with their supervisors. In turn, the quality of  leader-member exchange facilitates employees' job  effectiveness in terms of in-role and innovative job  performance and job satisfaction.  Furthermore, the results shed new light on the  relationship between goal orientation and job per  formance. Achievement goal theory suggests that  both mastery-oriented and performance-oriented  individuals are strongly motivated to meet their  respective achievement goals. This high level of  motivation is assumed to clarify the positive effects  of both goal orientations on actual performance that  have been documented in several studies (e.g., Bar  ron & Harackiewicz, 2000; Elliot & Church, 1997;  Ford et al., 1998; Harackiewicz et al., 1997; Utman,  1997; VandeWalle et al., 1999). Most of the studies This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:42:36 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  380 Academy of Management Journal June  that have reported positive links between perfor  mance orientation and actual performance have  been conducted among children and college stu  dents carrying out fixed cognitive tasks in educa  tional or laboratory settings (e.g., Barron & Harack  iewicz, 2000; Elliot & Church, 1997; Ford et al.,  1998; Harackiewicz et al., 1997). However, in the  current study, conducted among employees of an  organization in the energy sector, a performance  orientation in itself appeared to be negatively re  lated to in-role job performance. Supplementary  analyses showed that this negative relationship  was buffered by a strong mastery orientation. That  is, the level of in-role job performance was high  among employees with high ratings for a perfor  mance orientation only when they had high ratings  on mastery orientation as well. An explanation of  the present findings may be that a strong mastery  orientation shifts the focus away from typical  performance-oriented cognitions and evaluation  criteria, buffering or moderating the negative con  sequences of a performance orientation (Van  Yperen & Janssen, 2002). This result underscores  the need to pay more attention to the development of  multiple-goal models in achievement goal research  (Barron & Harackiewicz, 2000; Pintrich, 2000). An  interesting question is whether individuals hold  performance and mastery goals in mind simulta  neously, or whether they alternate between goal  states (cf. Harackiewicz et al., 1997). At any rate,  the positive correlation between mastery orienta  tion and performance orientation (r = .33) found in  the present study seems to indicate that these dif  ferent orientations tend to coexist in a person. The  common component responsible for this correla  tion might be the approach-oriented achievement  motivation reflected in both orientations that di  rected employees to pursue beneficial outcomes  rather than to avert detrimental outcomes (Elliot &  McGregor, 2001). As such, the positive correlation  between mastery and performance orientations  may call into question the common assumption  that the different goal orientations can be con  ceived of as orthogonal dimensions.  Furthermore, a performance orientation was  found to be unrelated to innovative job perfor  mance. The present findings suggest that a per  formance orientation interferes with employees' es  tablishing high-quality relationships with their  supervisors. These low-quality leader-member ex  changes signify that performance-oriented employ  ees lack important resources for skill development  and sociopolitical support, which might clarify  why a performance orientation is not advantageous  for an employee's innovative job performance.  Apparently, there is much research to be done to  improve researchers' understanding of the link be  tween performance orientation and actual perfor  mance, including the conditions under which this  link may exist (cf. Harackiewicz et al., 2002). Fur  thermore, more research is clearly needed to fur  ther explore the psychological mechanisms under  lying the effects of goal orientations (cf. Barron &  Harackiewicz, 2000). For example, VandeWalle  and his colleagues (1999) showed that the self  regulation tactics of goal setting, effort, and plan  ning mediated the positive relationship between  mastery orientation and job performance, whereas  performance orientation was unrelated to these  methods of skill development. In addition to those  task-oriented tactics, the added value of the current  study is that it explicates leader-member exchange  as an interpersonal mechanism that mediates the  relationship between employees' mastery orienta  tion and effectiveness on the job. An intriguing  question that arises from these cumulative results  is to what extent a high-quality leader-member ex  change process helps employees to focus on skill  development by means of self-regulation tactics.  The present study also contributes to the litera  ture on leader-member exchange. Most research in  this domain has been conducted to examine how  the process of leader-member exchange develops  and how the quality of leader-member exchange is  related to job performance and job attitudes for  employees and supervisors (e.g., Gerstner & Day,  1997; Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995; Liden, Sparrowe, &  Wayne, 1997). However, research devoted to pro  viding knowledge about the antecedents of leader  member exchange has only recently begun (cf.  Gerstner & Day, 1997). Primary research suggests  that factors such as relational demography, leader  member similarity, leader delegation, and person  ality traits of members and leaders influence the  development and quality of leader-member ex  change (e.g., Gerstner & Day, 1997; Graen & Uhl  Bien, 1995; Green et al., 1996; Liden et al., 1997).  The present study provides theoretical logic and  empirical evidence supporting the idea that goal  orientation influences employees' ability to de  velop and maintain favorable social exchanges  with their supervisors. Moreover, the quality of  leader-member exchange appeared to clarify why  employees with stronger mastery orientations are  more effective in terms of in-role job performance,  innovative job performance, and job satisfaction.  Therefore, future research might examine whether  leader-member exchange mediates the influence of  goal orientation on other effectiveness variables  such as organizational citizenship behaviors and  organizational commitment.  Some limitations of this research should also be This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:42:36 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2004 Janssen and Van Yperen 381  considered. First, the cross-sectional design of the  present study did not allow us to determine the  direction of causality among the variables. The re  sults are vulnerable to opposite and to bidirectional  relationships because of the possibility that an em  ployees' performance and satisfaction might in  fluence the development and quality of leader  member exchange, which, in turn, could shape  employees' goal orientations. An argument against  such reversed causality is the fact that theory and  previous research persuasively present both goal  orientation and leader-member exchange as major  causes of actual performance and task enjoyment  (e.g., Barron & Harackiewicz, 2000; Button et al.,  1996; Farr et al., 1993; Gerstner & Day, 1997; Graen  & Uhl-Bien, 1995; VandeWalle et al., 1997). More  over, goal orientations are viewed as rather stable  personality characteristics that are fostered by peo  ple's self-theories about the nature and develop  ment of attributes such as intelligence, personality,  and abilities (Dweck, 1999). In contrast, the quality  of leader-member exchange is a typical work con  text variable found to be dependent upon personal  characteristics of employees and leaders (e.g.,  Gerstner & Day, 1997; Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995;  Green et al., 1996; Liden et al., 1997). Hence, goal  orientation can be considered as an antecedent  rather than a consequence of the quality of leader  member exchange. An additional test of alternative  path models in which mastery and performance  orientations mediated the effects of LMX on the  outcome variables confirmed this conclusion.  The results demonstrated no mediation effects in  the regression of innovative job performance and  only modest mediation effects through mastery ori  entation in the regression analysis of in-role job  performance and job satisfaction. Nonetheless, the  cross-sectional survey data cannot rule out the al  ternative suppositions that goal orientation and  leader-member exchange are covariates or even  consequences rather than causes of effectiveness on  the job. Hence, longitudinal and experimental stud  ies are needed to provide evidence of causation.  Although the nature of the performance data (rat  ings by supervisors) is a strength of the present  study, a second limitation concerns possible com  mon method variance in the relationships between  the self-reported measures of goal orientation, the  mediating variable of leader-member exchange,  and the outcome variable of job satisfaction. How  ever, it is hard to imagine that the respondents in  this study would have artifactually caused the dif  fering patterns of relationships between mastery  orientation and performance orientation, on the  one hand, and leader-member exchange and job  satisfaction, on the other hand. Moreover, the me  diating effect of leader-member exchange in the  relationship between mastery orientation and job  satisfaction was identical to the mediating effects  in the relationships between mastery orientation  and in-role and innovative job performance rated  by the immediate supervisors of the respondents.  These considerations make us confident that com  mon method variance is not a major concern.  Finally, the sample consisted of lower-level em  ployees from an industrial organization in the  energy supply sector. Hierarchical level and partic  ular organizational factors might vary with employ  ees' goal orientations, leader-member exchange,  and job attitudes and behaviors. Therefore, gener  alization of the present results to employees per  forming their job duties on higher hierarchical lev  els and in other types of organizations awaits  further empirical examination.  Several findings of the current study might have  practical implications. In line with prior research  conducted in a field setting (VandeWalle et al.,  1999), the present results suggest that mastery  oriented employees tend to be more effective on the  job than performance-oriented employees. A mas  tery orientation might be of particular value for  performing the complex and challenging task of  innovation in the workplace. Employees with mas  tery orientations are intrinsically motivated in their  work, tend to invest a lot of effort in their jobs, and  attempt to establish high-quality social exchanges  with their supervisors. As delineated in the theo  retical section of this article, these conditions are  needed in order to succeed in the comprehensive  tasks of generating, promoting, and implementing  innovative ideas. Thus, the results of the present  study suggest that innovative job performance is  related to an employee's mastery orientation.  Therefore, organizations might consider selecting  employees with strong mastery orientations for po  sitions and roles directed toward initiating and im  plementing innovative changes.  Furthermore, although employees' goal orienta  tions are rather stable personal characteristics, they  are not indifferent to contextual factors (Ames,  1992; Harackiewicz et al., 1997; Button et al., 1996;  Dweck, 1999; Elliot, 1999; Farr et al., 1993; Pin  trich, 2000; Van Yperen & Janssen, 2002). As per  formance standards, production schedules, dead  lines, and the like are an integral part of any job  (Button et al., 1996), achievement situations on the  job might prompt employees to pursue perfor  mance goals (Van Yperen, 2003b). The present  findings show that a predominant performance ori  entation may lead to lower-quality leader-member  exchanges and to lower in-role job performance.  Accordingly, organizations would be wise to de This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:42:36 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  382 Academy of Management Journal June  sign a culture and practices that facilitate mastery  orientations among their employees in order to  buffer potential detrimental consequences of per  formance orientations primed by a given achieve  ment situation (cf. VandeWalle et al., 1999; Van  Yperen, 2003b). A mastery orientation might be  facilitated by, among other things, self-referenced  rather than other-referenced feedback and compen  sation systems that focus on effort, personal im  provement, skill development, experimentation,  and cooperation (e.g., Ames, 1992).  Finally, VandeWalle and his colleagues (1999)  suggested that training employees to change their  self-theories and attitudes towards ability, effort,  and performance could help them to adopt mastery  orientations in the performance of their job duties.  That is, employees can be taught to view effort as a  key determinant of job performance and profi  ciency as a malleable attribute that can be devel  oped in many ways. As the results of the present  study suggest, focusing on these mastery orienta  tion features is important as doing so enables  employees to establish the high-quality leader  member exchanges that are needed for high job  satisfaction and effective in-role and innovative job  performance.
