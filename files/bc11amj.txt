Contrary to prior  literature, the antecedents and consequences of quits and dismissals are quite similar. Comparing  three dimensions of employment systems, we find that high involvement work organization and  long-term investments and inducements are associated with significantly  lower quit and dismissal  rates, while short term performance-enhancing  expectations are related to significantly  higher  quit and dismissal rates. Establishments with higher quit and dismissal rates have  significantly  lower customer service, as reported by managers.  2  INTRODUCTION  Turnover is among the most important employment relations outcomes for both  employees and organizations. Employees face the uncertainties of job search and potential  unemployment. Organizations confront  uncertain costs and benefits: The costs of operational  disruption and replacement of human capital versus the benefits of lower-cost labor, or  fresh  skills to compete on innovation. These uncertainties raise the question of which  management  practices increase turnover; how much turnover is harmful  or beneficial, and under what  conditions and why? These questions have spawned a small, but growing set of organization  level studies of the antecedents and consequences of turnover.  This research complements the  large micro-organizational literature on how and why individuals choose to quit their jobs  (Griffeth,  Hom, & Gaertner, 2000; Hom & Griffeth, 1995; Maertz & Campion 2004).  However, research has largely focused on the issue of voluntary turnover, or total turnover  more generally, neglecting involuntary turnover in the form of dismissals. Here, we define  dismissals as employer decisions to fire individual employees, rather than decisions to cut costs  through mass layoffs, downsizing, early retirement buyouts, or organizational restructuring.  The  few existing studies of dismissals have conceptualized them as distinct from quits, with  different  antecedents and consequences (Dalton & Todor 1979; Donaghue & Castle, 2006; Knight &  Latreille, 2000; Shaw et al. 1998). While dismissals are viewed as the result of hiring errors,  which employers may correct by terminating poor performers, quits are seen as a relatively  rational process in which employees weigh their current job against alternative prospects. The  literature often assumes that quits undermine performance because better performers are more  likely to quit than poor performers, but theory and evidence are equivocal (McEvoy & Cascio,  1987; Osterman, 1987; Trevor, Gerhart, & Boudreau, 1997).  3  This paper draws on an alternative perspective, internal labor market theory (Doeringer  &  Piore 1971; Osterman, 1987), which focuses on how employers establish sets of internal  administrative rules (e.g., HR practices or employment systems) to advance their goals.  Here,  quits and dismissals are viewed as related phenomena with similar antecedents deriving from the  type of employment system that employers choose. Employers may manage turnover levels via  their choice of HR practices; and the optimal turnover level may vary by market, industry  conditions (Abelson & Baysinger, 1984), business strategy, or values (Baron, Burton, & Hannan,  1996). Cost-focused  firms, for example, may use high turnover to minimize labor costs.  Jack  Welch at GE, by contrast, built a ‘performance culture’ through an explicit policy of dismissing  10 percent of employees each year (Welch, 2005: 37-52).  To investigate these alternative theories, we examine the relationship between quits and  dismissals and three dimensions of the employment system: work organization, commitment- inducing long term incentives, and performance-enhancing  short-term incentives. We also  explore their relationship to customer satisfaction, an increasingly important outcome for  firm  competitiveness (Fornell, Van Amburg, Morgeson, & Bryant, 2005; Lovelock & Wirtz, 2005).  We draw on a 2003 national survey of US call centers, as well as longitudinal data for a subset of  these establishments. Call centers are an appropriate context for this study because high rates of  turnover are a major source of high costs and poor service quality. Despite off-shoring  trends,  they also employ over 4 million workers in interactive voice services (3 percent of the US  workforce), compared to less than 400,000 comparable employees in India and the Philippines  (Batt, Holman, & Holtgrewe, 2009: 465).  4  THEORY AND HYPOTHESES  The theory that quits and dismissals have distinct antecedents draws on the early work of  Dalton and others, who distinguished between ‘functional’ turnover (where poor  performers  leave) and ‘dysfunctional’ turnover (where high performers leave) (Dalton, Krackhardt, & Porter  1981; Abelson & Baysinger, 1984). Dismissals are equated with functional turnover while quits  are equated with dysfunctional turnover (Jacofsky, 1984; Sturman, Trevor, Boudreau, & Gerhart,  2003). McElroy and colleagues, for example, argued that, “Dismissals are a function of poor  individual performance or of insubordination….” (2001:1294). Shaw and colleagues noted that,  “In an organization with high quit rates, for various reasons employees find it more attractive to  leave than to stay. In an organization with high discharge rates, however, presumably incorrect  hiring decisions are remedied through termination” (1998:512).  Of course, poor  performance  also may be due to other factors than hiring errors – new production systems may render  employee skills obsolete, employee motivation or commitment may change.  The assumption that quits and dismissals have distinct antecedents is theoretically  plausible, but has not been systematically tested, and existing studies show mixed results.  Wanous, Stumpf, and Bedrosian (1979) found that job attitudes and performance  were  significant  predictors of both types of turnover, but job attitudes explained more variance for  quits, and performance  more variance for dismissals.  Organizational factors (job training and  pay) accounted for the most variance for both types of turnover. Stumpf and Dawley (1981)  found that absenteeism and job performance  significantly explained the incidence of both quits  and dismissals, but absenteeism explained a higher proportion of variance in dismissals.  Recent organization-level research also provides mixed results based on  industry-specific  studies of trucking (Shaw et al. 1998) and nursing homes (Donaghue & Castle, 2006). Donaghue  5  and Castle (2006) found several differences  between quits and dismissals, but noted that “…most  of the organizational characteristics held similar associations to voluntary and involuntary  turnover….” (2006:467). Shaw and colleagues (1998) argued that  commitment-enhancing  investments and inducements (higher pay, benefits, job stability, training) should lower quit  rates, while performance-enhancing  HR practices (electronic monitoring, longer work hours) that  raise the expectations of employee effort  and accountability should increase quits. By contrast, a  third HR practice -- the staffing  system (selection procedures, performance appraisals) -- should  only affect  dismissals.  While some of their predictions were confirmed,  the paper raised other  questions.  Why should performance-enhancing  practices only affect  quit rates, when these  practices should uncover weaknesses in poor performers, leading to their dismissal? Similarly,  why should better selection procedures only affect  dismissals, when quit rates depend on getting  the right ‘fit’ between the individual and the organization?  Existing research, therefore, leaves many questions unanswered and suggests that other  theories may help explain these relationships. Osterman, for example, argued that employers  view turnover “…as a strategic variable – part of a larger set of personnel policies that the firm  manipulates to achieve its ends…. In some models, the firm … explicitly considers and chooses  the level of turnover along with other characteristics of the employment system” (1987: 289-90).  Firms that choose to compete on service quality or customer loyalty may seek to keep turnover  low, as research suggests that quality is higher where turnover is lower – due to employee  motivation (Schlesinger & Heskitt, 1991) or to the firm-specific  skills and knowledge of  customers that experienced workers have (Batt, 2002).  By contrast, a high turnover model may  be acceptable or even desirable for cost-focused  firms if lower operational costs outweigh higher  turnover costs.  In his classic defense of the production-line approach to services, Levitt (1972)  6  argued that efficiency  and profitability would be higher if service industries adopted more  standardized work processes – processes that also create more monotonous, high turnover jobs  (Schlesinger and Heskitt, 1991). Of course, not all firms think strategically about turnover; and  many, particularly those facing weak competitive markets, may use ‘bad’ or unproductive  management practices (Bloom & Van Reenen, 2007), which are likely to result in high turnover.  In the sections below, we examine specific HR practices, and their theoretical relationship  to quits, dismissals, and operational performance.  Theory is more well-developed for quits than  for dismissals (Griffeth,  Hom, & Gaertner, 2000; Hom & Griffeth,  1995; Maertz & Campion  2004).  Employees quit when they are dissatisfied  with HR practices and working conditions;  and their quitting raises labor costs and disrupts operations. Employees are dismissed, by  contrast, when HR policies allow employers to identify weak performers  or lead employees to  perform badly, ultimately leading to their dismissal.  This may occur in two ways.  Some HR  practices, such as performance  monitoring, provide information  that allows poor performers to  be more accurately identified  and dismissed.  Other HR practices create more demanding or  onerous work, leaving the less-able more exposed to discipline, and ultimately dismissal.  We analyze three sets of HR practices, rather than HR practices taken as a coherent bundle,  because prior research suggests that they have potentially different  effects  (Appelbaum, Bailey,  Berg & Kalleberg, 2000; Batt et al., 2002; Shaw et al., 1998, 2009). Building on the work of  Shaw and colleagues (1998, 2009), we examine investments and inducements (practices that  invest in employees’ human capital and induce commitment), and  performance-enhancing  expectations (practices that enhance performance expectations). We also examine the role of  work organization because considerable research has demonstrated its substantial relationship to  turnover and performance (Appelbaum et al., 2000; Batt, 2002; Wood et al., 2006).  7  Work Organization  Variation in work organization has grown in recent decades as employers have used  different  approaches to compete on price, quality, innovation, or time-to-market. Some  organizations rely on Taylorized work design (individually-defined  jobs with low discretion),  characteristic of mass production systems, while others have promoted employee involvement  and group problem-solving and learning. The large job characteristics literature provides  persuasive evidence that Taylorized jobs demotivate workers and lead to higher turnover (Dalton  & Todor, 1979); while higher discretion jobs are more intrinsically meaningful (Hackman &  Oldham, 1980), leading to higher satisfaction, commitment, and lower quits (Wood et al., 2006).  Approaches to work design that combine employee discretion with group problem- solving are often defined as ‘high involvement work organization’. Drawing on concepts from  total quality management (TQM) (Deming, 1982) and socio-technical systems (STS) (Trist,  1981), this approach assumes that employees need discretion at work in order to utilize their tacit  knowledge to diagnose and solve operational problems. These literatures also assume that  problem-solving is best achieved through group collaboration: Under TQM, quality circles that  discuss problems ‘off-line’ (away from work stations); and under STS, work organized into ‘on(cid:173) line’ teams, with considerable operational autonomy.  Although some argue that team-based systems are potentially onerous because peer  monitoring and enforcement  of group norms may dominate individual discretion (Barker, 1999),  even in Barker’s classic ethnography of self-managed  teams, employees preferred teams over the  prior system of Taylorized work. In settings such as call centers, where work tasks are  individualized and scripted, opportunities for greater discretion and group interaction have been  8  found to relieve boredom, stress, and social isolation, leading to lower absenteeism and turnover  and better sales performance (Batt, 1999, 2002; Deery, Iverson, & Walsh, 2002).  While theory and evidence provide reasonable support that high involvement work design  reduces quit rates (Arthur, 1994; Batt, 2002; Huselid, 1995), the predictions for dismissals are  less clear.  Dismissals may be higher than in Taylorized operations if those employees who have  fewer skills or abilities are given more discretion, and they stand out as unable to perform; or if  peer-monitoring exposes free-riders, leading to their discipline or dismissal (Barker, 1999).  However, we believe that dismissals are likely to be higher in Taylorized systems because  individual performance  may be more accurately monitored and poor performers cannot free ride  in their workgroups.  In addition, high involvement systems provide a structure of  cooperation  and mutual learning in which employees who run into problems can obtain help from co- workers. In sum, high involvement work organization may ‘raise all boats’ and lower dismissals.  A less generous argument yields a similar hypothesis. Where workers have greater control  over the work process, as in high involvement work systems, they can sanction managers who  engage in what they view as unjustified  disciplinary action (Klaas, Brown & Heneman, 1998) –  yielding lower dismissal rates.  In sum, the existing literature yields the following  hypothesis:  Hypothesis 1: Work organization practices that enhance employee discretion and group  collaboration will be associated with lower quit rates and lower dismissal rates.  Long-term Incentives: Investment and Inducement  Strategies  The concept of investments and inducements draws on internal labor market theory which  posits that higher relative pay, benefits, internal promotion opportunities, and procedures for  employment security provide long-term incentives that lead employees to stay with the  organization (Doeringer & Piore, 1971). Employers may seek low voluntary turnover to compete  9  on the basis of firm-specific  skills or a unique human resource base. The empirical evidence of a  negative relationship between investments and inducements and voluntary turnover is growing,  including organizational studies that measure bundles of high involvement work and  commitment-enhancing practices (Arthur 1994; Huselid 1995), as well as those with separate  measures of inducements and investments (Batt et al., 2002; Shaw et al., 1998).  However, the theoretical relationship between these long-term incentives and dismissals is  undeveloped. Dismissals may be higher in these systems if employers are unwilling to make  costly investments in employees whom they perceive as less able to perform or to learn new  tasks.  However, we believe that these incentives are more likely to motivate employees to avoid  the types of behaviors that lead to dismissal. According to efficiency-wage  theory, employees of  firms paying above market wages should engage in less shirking, thereby reducing disciplinary  problems that lead to dismissal (Cappelli & Chauvin, 1991; Klaas, Brown & Heneman, 1998).  Generous benefit  packages and internal career ladders should similarly engender this  effect.  Firms that invest more in the workforce may be reluctant to dismiss workers with this  accumulated human capital (Klaas, Brown & Heneman, 1998), unless the employee misbehavior  is egregious. The unfolding  model of turnover also suggests that employee development  plays  the role of maintaining skills and reducing the likelihood of precipitating events that lead to an  employee’s leaving a job (Lee & Mitchell, 1994). Finally, employers who attempt to compete by  building a culture of trust and the synergies of social capital (Leana & Van Buren III, 1999) may  try to limit overall turnover as much as possible because it disrupts the social fabric of work.  Empirical support for these arguments is mixed. Shaw and colleagues (2009) found that  HRM inducements were negatively related to the quits of both ‘good’ and ‘poor’ performing  employees, significant  for the former  in study 1 and the latter in study 2. Knight and Latrielle  10  (2000) argued that high commitment practices should be associated with lower dismissal rates,  but they only found a negative relationship between dismissals and profit-sharing. In sum, the  bulk of existing theory and evidence suggest that inducements and incentives should have the  same relationship to quits and dismissals:  Hypothesis 2: Employment practices emphasizing inducements and investments will be  associated with lower quit rates and lower dismissal rates.  Short-term Incentives: Performance-enhancing  Expectations  The concept of performance-enhancing  expectations (Shaw et al., 1998; Tsui et al., 1997)  has advanced the literature by identifying  distinct parts of the HR system that may  differentially  affect  employee performance. Performance-enhancing  practices are short-term incentives  designed to respond to immediate competitive pressures to improve performance. They may  include behavior-oriented measures (electronic monitoring, performance appraisals) and  outcome-oriented measures, such as pay linked to employee performance.  While theory suggests  that they are often substitutes (outcome measures used for hard-to-monitor jobs), in fact,  employers often view them as complementary.  Where good service is viewed as an antecedent  to sales (Schlesinger & Heskitt, 1991), as in service and sales settings, electronic systems  monitor the quality of service interactions while commission pay provides incentives for sales.  In theory, more extensive use of performance  monitoring creates higher expectations and  more onerous working conditions, leading to higher quit rates.  Employees typically view on(cid:173) going electronic monitoring as an invasion of privacy and an indication of lack of trust, leading  even ‘good performers’ to be dissatisfied  and quit.  Empirical studies show that electronic  monitoring is significantly  linked to higher job-related stress (Carayon, 1993; Deery et al., 2002;  Holman, Chissick, & Totterdell, 2002), an antecedent to voluntary turnover (de Croon, Sluiter,  11  Blonk, Broersen & Frings-Dresen 2004), and higher quit rates (Batt et al., 2002; Shaw et al.  1998; Wilson & Peel, 1991).  It also should lead to higher dismissals because it provides accurate  information about performance, assuaging employer uncertainty about whether claims of poor  performance are accurate (Klaas, Brown & Henemann, 1998). However, the only study of these  relationships found a positive relationship between performance appraisals and dismissals, but  none between monitoring and dismissals (Shaw et al., 1998).  Performance-based  pay, by contrast, provides an outcome measure that sorts employees  according to their ability to meet objective standards (Gerhart & Rynes 2003).  The predictions  for the relationship between performance-based  pay and dismissals are consistent with our  arguments regarding electronic monitoring.  Pay-for-performance  (in this case, commission- based pay) provides clear, objective measures that allow employers to more accurately  identify  poor performers and dismiss them.  The predictions for overall quit rates are less straightforward.  They depend on the net  effect  of four factors.  First, employees who perform poorly under these pay plans are likely to  quit more, either because they find them onerous or because they anticipate being fired.  Second,  employees who perform well under these plans are likely to quit less than they otherwise would  because they earn more (Harrison, Virick, & William, 1996; Lazear, 1999).  One department  store study found higher earnings for workers who received a base salary plus commission,  rather than either a base salary alone or a commission alone (Patterson, 1992).  Third, employees  who perform well under these plans may nonetheless quit because they experience greater job- related stress – pressure to sell and to be ‘on’ all day in order to make their commissions.  A fourth factor that affects  quit rates is the level of pay that is at risk and the level of risk  aversion of the workforce.  Most research on pay-for-performance  has focused on pay that is not  12  at-risk (individual bonuses, merit pay, gain-sharing, profit-sharing  over and above an employees’  normal pay) (Gerhart & Rynes, 2003). Commission pay is pay-at-risk, making weekly wages  variable and uncertain.  In addition, factors beyond workers’ control affect  their  commission  levels: changing economic conditions, the product’s competitiveness, and variation in the  customers that employees are assigned to serve.  While companies may try to adjust  the payout  formula to improve the pay-for-performance  link, research shows that this is quite difficult  to do;  and in uncertain market conditions when workers are more likely to be dissatisfied  with payouts,  employers whose profit margins are uncertain may be reluctant to increase the generosity of  commission pay formulas.  Thus, the impact of commission pay on quit rates is likely to depend  on how risk averse workers are.  Risk aversion varies among individual workers, but research  has documented two general patterns.  First, women have higher risk aversion than men (Byrnes,  Miller, & Schaefer, 1999).  Second, workers with lower skill levels and wages have higher risk  aversion (Caroli & García-Peñalosa, 2002).  Nadler and Wiswall (2009), for example, found that  teacher support for a policy shift  from scheduled, fixed-pay increases to merit pay was higher in  school districts that offered  higher base salaries and had a higher proportion of teachers with  masters’ degrees (as opposed to bachelors’ degrees).  Even here, however, the teachers would  only support merit pay if their current base salary was guaranteed – that is, no pay-at-risk.  The workforce in the current study is predominantly female (on average 70 percent), does  not have a college degree, and receives a relatively low wage – considerably lower than teachers.  Assuming that a large proportion of these employees are risk averse, many are likely to prefer  the certainty of a stable weekly income over a variable one, even if the variable pay plan offers a  somewhat higher annual pay.  In this context, therefore, we believe that the net effect  of these  four factors will yield a positive relationship between the use of commission pay and quit rates.  13  Hypothesis 3: Performance-enhancing  practices will be positively related to both quit rates  and dismissal rates.  HR Practices, Quits, Dismissals, and Performance  Theory and evidence on the relationship between HR practices and organizational  performance has expanded considerably in the last two decades, although questions remain  unanswered. An exhaustive review of empirical studies concluded that, on average, high  involvement work systems are associated with significantly higher operational  performance  (Combs, Liu, Hall, & Ketchen, 2006); and some recent studies have linked HR practices  specifically to better customer satisfaction (Liao & Chuang, 2004). While studies differ  in their  approach to measurement, they typically include two dimensions examined here: high  involvement work organization and commitment-enhancing  investments and inducements. In  theory, organizations that make greater use of high involvement work organization should have  higher performance because they provide employees with the discretion and opportunity to  collaborate to solve problems effectively.  Commitment-enhancing  incentives motivate  employees to use their skills and discretionary effort  to advance the interests of the organization.  The concept of performance-enhancing  expectations has not been part of the high  involvement literature. However, organizations that make more intensive use of these practices  should, in theory, experience better performance  because these practices are designed to induce  employees to meet immediate performance goals.  Hypothesis 4a: High involvement work organization, investment and inducement practices,  and performance-enhancing  expectations will each individually be associated with higher  levels of operational performance.  14  Theory also predicts that the synergies from these three types of HR practices should be  multiplicative, but some studies have found evidence of interactions (Huselid, 1995; Shaw et al.,  2009), while others have not (e.g. Cappelli and Neumark 2004). These mixed findings suggest  that it is worthwhile to further  explore the synergies of these practices.  Hypothesis 4b: The interactions of high involvement work, investment and inducement  practices, and performance-enhancing  expectations will be associated with higher levels of  operational performance than the simple additive effect  of these HR practices.  Turnover and Performance  The theory linking turnover and organizational performance  is more equivocal (Bluedorn  1982; Osterman, 1987). The link depends in part on which workers leave, and who they are  replaced by. While the literature has assumed that more able employees quit more often, those  with valuable firm-specific  skills may stay, in part because their skills are less valuable  externally. Studies finding that ‘better’ performers are more likely to quit (Wells & Muchinsky,  1985; Tang & Frost, 1999) stack up against those that find the opposite (Martin, Price, &  Mueller, 1981), while McEvoy and Cascio (1987) found a negative relationship between  performance and both quits and dismissals, and Trevor and colleagues (1997) showed that high  and low performers quit more than do average employees. The phenomenon also may be context  specific. For example, Shaw and colleagues (2009) found that quits among good and poor  performers in trucking were correlated at .58, but not at all in supermarkets.  Similarly, while theory would argue that dismissing less able employees should improve  performance, the only organizational study that differentiates  quits and dismissals found the  opposite: Higher dismissal rates in bank branches negatively affected  customer satisfaction and  cost per loan (McElroy, Morrow, & Rude, 2001).  15  Beyond this classic discussion about who quits or is dismissed, another line of argument  focuses on the extent to which overall turnover – whatever its source – is dysfunctional  because  it contributes to higher costs and operational disruption (Hausknecht, Trevor, and Howard, 2009;  Watrous, Huffman,  & Pritchard, 2006). Regardless of whether an employee quits or is fired,  recruitment and training costs are the same. Short-term productivity may be lower until the new  employee becomes fully proficient  (Batt, 2002) and longer term performance depends on  whether the new recruit is more able than the dismissed employee, which is not certain if the  organization’s labor pool and selection procedures are unchanged (Hausknecht et al., 2009).  High overall turnover may raise transactions costs by: Requiring higher  management-to-worker  ratios; undermining workplace rules that form the basis of organizational control (Price, 1977);  shifting resources and experienced workers away from daily work to train and socialize novices  (Staw, 1980); disrupting the social fabric and bonds of trust and social capital that have been  shown to positively affect  performance (Shaw, Duffy,  Johnson, & Lockhart, 2005); or lowering  flexibility for internal redeployment or rotation across different  jobs or skill sets.  In sum, the relationship between turnover and performance  is likely to be the complex  result of multiple contingencies -- depending on the institutional, organizational, and market  context of firms and on how performance  is measured. Despite theoretical ambiguities, however,  the preponderance of evidence is that total turnover and voluntary turnover are both negatively  related to operational performance, and specifically to service quality and customer  satisfaction  (Kacmar, Andrews, Van Rooy, Steilberg, & Cerrone, 2006; McElroy et al., 2001). These  arguments suggest the following  hypothesis:  Hypothesis 5a: Quit and dismissal rates will be negatively related to operational  performance:  16  These theoretical  arguments  also suggest  that  whether  turnover  mediates  the  relationship  between  HR  practices  and  performance  may  depend  upon  the  contingencies  discussed  above.  Studies  finding  partial  mediation  for  voluntary  turnover  include  those  by  Huselid  (1995), Batt  (2002), and  Way (2002). However,  if  indeed  quit  rates have  a  negative  effect  on  performance  and dismissals have a positive effect,  as some have argued (Koys, 2001:111), then the mediating  effect  may be insignificant. The literature, then, suggests the following  hypothesis:  Hypothesis 5b: The HR – performance  relationship will be mediated by the additive effect  of  quit rates and dismissal rates.  METHODS  Sample  The data for this study come from a 1998 stratified  nationally-random survey of call  centers in the telecommunications industry, based on the Dun and Bradstreet listing of  establishments, and a 2003 nationally-random survey of call centers across all industries.  Limiting the sample to organizations providing the same types of services enhances  comparability and reduces extraneous sources of variation and measurement error (Becker &  Gerhart, 1996: 792; Osterman, 1994). The longitudinal dataset includes telecommunications  industry establishments surveyed in both 1998 and 2003; but due in part to the dot.com bust in  the intervening period, only 40 percent of the 1998 sample was able to be identified  in 2003. A  response rate of 68 percent for the matched cases yielded a longitudinal sample of 97 centers.  Identifying  the 2003 population of call centers across industries was difficult  because there  is no official data on call centers, and many are located within larger organizations. By contrast,  as a large proportion of establishments in telecommunications are call centers, they could be  easily identified  via initial screening. As a result, for 2003, we used the Call Center Magazine  17  subscription list, with over 60,000 subscribers. We pulled a random sample of subscribers who  were listed as the general directors or managers of their centers, stratified  by the industry they  served. After exclusions for missing data on the variables of interest, the 2003 sample is 339  establishments (including those in the longitudinal sample), while the longitudinal sample is 93.  Both the 1998 and 2003 telephone surveys were administered by a university-based  survey  research institute to the senior manager at each center. It took 52 minutes on average in 1998 and  45 minutes in 2003. Questions focused on call center agents, defined as the “core” workforce  (Osterman, 1994). Given our large, nationally representative sample, it was not feasible to survey  multiple respondents at each site. However, Gerhart, Wright, McMahan, and Snell (2000) note  that establishment surveys are generally more reliable than corporate-level surveys as the  workforce is much smaller, and the managers are generally knowledgeable about the HR  practices they are responsible for implementing. The average size of the core workforce was 107  in 1998 and 167 in 2003; the median size was 24 in 1998 and 73 in 2003.  The 1998 and 2003 samples differed  in minor ways, reflecting the changes in the overall  economy as well as differences  in the industries covered in the two periods. Mean quit rates were  10.5 percent in the 1998 sample and 14.9 percent in the 2003 sample, while local unemployment  rates averaged 4.6 and 5.4 percent respectively. Years of formal education averaged 13.6 years  for the typical employee in 1998 and 13.4 years in 2003. Workforce size increased over time,  reflecting the consolidation of operations into larger centers. Workforce size was also smaller in  the longitudinal sample. More generally, it is important to recognize that there is an inherent  selection bias in the longitudinal data in favor of establishments that continued to operate over  this five-year  period, likely selecting out poorer performing  establishments.  18  Measures1  Dependent variables. The four dependent variables provide indicators of quits, dismissals,  total turnover, and customer satisfaction. The quit rate is the percentage of workers who quit  voluntarily in the past year, while the dismissal rate is the percentage of workers who were  dismissed. Total turnover is the percentage of workers who either quit or were dismissed in the  past year. These measures exclude promotions, retirements, buy-outs, and lay-offs. Customer  satisfaction is constructed from the mean of two standardized items (alpha= 0.59): the average  level of customer satisfaction (1-5 scale); and the center’s customer satisfaction  level compared  to other competitors (1-5 scale, with anchors “much lower” and “much higher”). This provides a  measure of operational performance, rather than cost-adjusted  or financial performance. While  this is a subjective measure, it is an important and widely discussed metric in this industry.  Independent variables. We measured high involvement work organization by three  variables: The extent of employee discretion; use of problem-solving groups; and use of self- directed teams (see Batt, 2002). The discretion scale (MacDuffie,  1995; Batt, 2002) is the  average of the extent to which employees have discretion (from none (1) to complete (5)) over  operational issues, such as: daily tasks or assignments; tools or procedures; the pace or speed of  work; setting daily lunch and break schedules; settling customer complaints without a supervisor  (alpha = .77). Problem-solving groups is the percentage of workers involved in off-line  groups  with supervisors to discuss work-related issues. Self-directed teams is the percentage of workers  organized into on-line semi-autonomous teams. The high involvement work index is the mean of  the standardized values of discretion, problem-solving groups, and self-directed teams.  Detailed definitions of all variables are found in Appendix 1.  19  All three of our HR indexes (high involvement  work organization, investment and  inducement practices, and performance enhancing practices) are additive -- conceptualized as  composed of substitutable elements, which provide alternative means of achieving the same  objective. We treat them as additive indices rather than as items in a scale representing an  underlying latent variable – an approach well-established in the HR-Performance  literature  (Appelbaum et al. 2000; Batt 2002; Shaw et al. 2009).  Investment and inducement practices are a slightly modified version of Shaw et al.’s  measure (1998; 2009), which captures the use of internal labor market practices (internal  mobility opportunities, relative pay, pensions, and employment security). Internal mobility  opportunities are measured by the percentage of the core workforce promoted to higher positions  or transferred  within the larger organization. Transfers allow employees to move to jobs that  provide experience for subsequent promotions or offer  preferable working conditions or  locations. Relative pay is the average annual pay (in dollars) of the typical (median) core worker,  relative to the median wage of customer service employees in the metropolitan area or county in  which the establishment is located (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2001). This definition of pay  measures the relative attractiveness of the current job compared to local alternatives, which is  likely to influence turnover decisions. The pension variable is a dichotomous variable, which  equals 1 if employees are covered by a defined  benefit  pension plan, a type of long-term deferred  compensation benefit  used to tie employees to the firm.  Employment security is the proportion of the workforce that is full-time and permanent, as  opposed to contingent (part-time or temporary). While some argue that contingent workers may  serve as a buffer  to protect full time workers, research shows that they are often used for  cost- cutting (Houseman, 2001); and quit rates among core workers are higher in establishments  20  making greater use of contingent workers (Batt et al., 2002).  In these cases, firms send a signal  to core employees that their jobs are insecure because future cost-cutting may lead to converting  more core jobs to contingent positions. In addition, the availability of contingent workers as  substitutes for core employees puts downward pressure on the wages of incumbent  employees  (Katz and Krueger, 1999; Houseman, 2001), thereby unintentionally inducing higher quit rates  among these employees. Combining these four measures, we constructed a standardized additive  index of investments and inducements. The first three measures are also used in the Shaw et al.  (2009) investments and inducements index. We add the fourth measure, internal mobility  opportunities to capture the internal labor market theory based arguments that this is a key  practice indicating long-term investments in and inducements for the workforce.  Performance enhancing practices are measured by two commonly used practices in call  centers: Monitoring intensity and individual commission pay. Monitoring intensity is the average  of three questions: How often core employees receive statistics on performance; how often their  calls are listened to by supervisors; and how often they get feedback on phone technique  (frequency  scale of 1-8, where 1 = never and 8 = daily) (Alpha = .66). Commission pay is the  percentage of annual earnings of the typical core worker that comes from  individual  commissions (at risk pay). In this sample, 57.8 percent of establishments made no use of  commission pay.  Of the remaining 42.2 percent of establishments that made some use of it, the  mean percentage of total pay that was commission pay was 27.1%.  Overall, 11.2 percent of  establishments had 1-9 percent of pay at risk; 15.6 percent had 10-25 percent at risk; 5.6 percent  had 26-50 percent at risk; and 5.9 percent had >50-100% at risk.  We standardized the monitoring and commission pay variables and constructed a  standardized additive performance-enhancing practices index. Our approach is similar to that of  21  Shaw et al. (2009), who also used monitoring and performance-based  pay in their expectations- enhancing practices index.  Control variables. We included several variables to control for market, organizational, and  workforce characteristics. The local unemployment rate controls for variation in labor market  conditions: Higher unemployment rates or alternative job opportunities are negatively correlated  with turnover (e.g., Carsten & Spector 1987; Gerhart 1990). We control for  industry  (telecommunications versus others) as telecommunications is over-represented in the sample.  Union coverage is a dichotomous variable (1=yes, 0=no), as a core workforce is legally defined  as one bargaining unit, with complete union coverage or none at all. Controls for  ownership  include whether the center is in-house (owned by a primary firm, 1 = yes) or outsourced (owned  by a subcontractor). A series of dummy variables captures the primary segment served by the  center: large business, small business, residential clients, or all segments (the omitted category).  We control for workforce size, (of the core workforce), as larger establishments may have more  turnover due to a more standardized work environment. We also control for the age of the  establishment, as older establishments may have more stable employment systems; and whether  it had recent layoffs (in the last year), as research has shown that downsizing may undermine  employee commitment, leading to higher quit rates (Trevor & Nyberg, 2008).  To control for the human capital and demographic characteristics that may influence  employees’ relative ease of movement, we include: The percentage of the workforce that is  female (percent  female); the average number of years of education of the typical worker at the  site (average education) (Bretz, Boudreau, & Judge, 1994; Trevor 2001); and the number of  weeks of initial training and on-the-job experience for workers to become fully qualified (initial  training). These human capital controls are important to our argument because they help us to  22  identify the degree to which employment systems, rather just a higher quality workforce,  affect  quits, dismissals, and performance. Two particularly important control variables capture  selection practices, as selectivity is a major competing explanation for variation in quits and  dismissals. We measure the selection ratio as the percentage of applicants hired by the  establishment and systematic selection procedures as the proportion of the core workforce that  has been selected using systematic selection tests (psychometric tests or aptitude tests).  RESULTS  Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations, and bi-variate correlations for the  variables. The average annual quit rate in this sample is 14.9 percent, the dismissal rate is 9.8  percent, and average total turnover is 24.7 percent (with a range of close to zero to over 100  percent).  Note that the dismissal rate is much higher than prior studies of banking (5%, McEloy  et al. 2001) or truckers (5.9%, Shaw et al. 1998), which may be partly due to the effectiveness of  electronic monitoring in calling centers for identifying  poor performers. Table 2 presents the  estimation equations for the first three dependent variables (quits, dismissals, and total turnover),  using the cross-sectional sample. Table 3 replicates these equations, using the longitudinal  sample, with lagged HR index variables from 1998 to estimate turnover outcomes in 2003. Table  4 presents the equations for customer satisfaction, using the cross sectional sample.  - Table 1 about here - Beginning with the simple bi-variate correlations, we find a striking degree of similarity in  the predicted HR factors for both quits and dismissals. The high involvement work index is  associated with lower quits (r=-0.28*)2 and lower dismissals (r=-0.18*). The results are similar  for the individual practices in this index, including worker discretion (r=-0.25* for quits and r=- 0.20* for dismissals), problem-solving groups (r=-0.23* for quits and r=-0.14* for dismissals)  23  and self-directed  teams (r=-0.12* for quits and r=-0.04 for dismissals). Similarly, the investments  and inducements index is significantly associated with both lower quits (r=-0.33*) and lower  dismissals (r=-0.25*). Individual practices comprising this index also have parallel results, as  seen for internal promotion (r=-0.20* for quits and r=-0.22* for dismissals), relative pay (r=- 0.22* for quits and r=-0.09 for dismissals), pensions (r=-0.10 for quits and r=-0.20* for  dismissals), and full-time and permanent workforce (r=-0.27* for quits and r=-0.11* for  dismissals). The performance-enhancing  practices index is positively correlated with both quits  (r=0.24*) and dismissals (r=0.22*), with parallel associations for the components of this index -- monitoring intensity (r=0.27* for quits and r=0.20* for dismissals) and commission pay (r=0.08  for quits and r=0.11* for dismissals). Thus, for all of the HR indexes and individual practices, we  find initial support for the hypotheses 1, 2, and 3, suggesting similar antecedents for quits and  dismissals. To further  investigate these relationships, we now turn to our multivariate models.  Multivariate Analyses  - Table 2 about here –  Estimation of multivariate models for our dependent variables requires accounting for the  functional form of these variables, which are measured as rates, and therefore have a lower  bound of zero (negative values are impossible). This produces a censored distribution, where  only part of the normal distribution is observed. Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates for  censored distributions produce biased estimates. To produce consistent estimates of the  parameters, it is necessary to use a Tobit model for the estimation (Long 1997: 187-9).  We begin by estimating base models consisting of market, organizational, and  workforce  controls as predictors of quits, dismissals, and total turnover (models 1a, 1b, and 1c in table 2).  * Indicates significance at the p<.05 level.  24  Next we add the set of three HR indexes (models 2a, 2b, and 2c in table 2). Finally, we examine  the interaction terms for the three HR indexes (model 3a, 3b, and 3c in table 2).  Use of Tobit models in the estimation complicates the interpretation of effect  sizes: The  Tobit coefficients  represent changes in the latent variable y*, rather than the censored variable y.  For interpretation of effect  sizes, the Tobit coefficients  need to be multiplied by the appropriate  conversion factors to produce the change in the observed censored variable y (Long 1997).3 For  ease of interpretation, all effect  sizes for variables in our Tobit models are reported in the text  and tables as marginal effects  in terms of percentage point changes in the observed dismissal,  quit, and total turnover rates, calculated at the means of the variables.  In the analyses, we found strong support for hypothesis 1: Organizations that make greater  use of high-involvement work practices have significantly lower quit rates (p<.001, model 2a,  table 2), lower dismissal rates (p<.05, model 2b, table 2), and lower total turnover (p<.001,  model 2c, table 2). A one standard deviation increase (0.67) in the high-involvement index is  associated with a 3.4 percentage point lower quit rate (0.67*-5.04), a 1.4 percentage point lower  dismissal rate, and a 4.5 percentage point decrease in total turnover.  We also found strong support for hypothesis 2: The investments and inducements index is  significantly associated with lower quits (p<.05, model 2a, table 2), dismissals (p<.05, model 2b,  table 2), and total turnover (p<.01, model 2c, table 2). A one standard deviation increase (0.63) in  the investments and inducements index yields a 1.9 percentage point lower quit rate, a  1.5  percentage point lower dismissal rate, and a 3.5 percentage point decrease in total turnover.  3 For a tobit model with a lower limit, the formula for the total change in the observed variable y is F(z)ß, where ß is  the unadjusted  tobit coefficient  and F(z) is the cumulative density function  for the probability of the observation  being uncensored (Long 1997: 209).  25  Similarly, the performance-enhancing  incentives index has the same (positive) relationship  with quits and dismissals (Table 2). Organizations that make greater use of  performance  incentives have significantly higher quit rates (p<.001, model 2a), higher dismissal rates (p<.001,  model 2b), and higher total turnover (p<.001, model 2c). A one standard deviation (0.65)  increase in the performance-enhancing  index is associated with a 3.3 percentage point higher quit  rate, a 2.0 percentage point higher dismissal rate, and a 5.2 percentage point increase in total  turnover.  In sum, for all three HR indexes, the relationships between the index and both quits  and dismissals are highly significantly and in the same direction.  We investigated the possibility of interactions between the different  HR indexes, which  might indicate either complementarities or incompatibilities between these different  approaches  to HR management. Among the two-way interactions, the only significant  result was for the  interaction between the high involvement index and the performance-enhancing  index and quits  (p<.05, model 2a, table 2).  The same interaction term for total turnover was marginally  significant  (p<.10, model 2c, table 2). These results indicate that the combination of higher  scores on both of these indexes were associated with higher quits and higher total turnover. A  three-way interaction term was tested as well (in analysis not shown), but was not  significant.  In addition to the findings for the employment systems variables, our results also indicate  some interesting relationships between our control variables and both types of turnover. Notably,  union representation is associated with significantly lower quit rates (p<.001, models 1a, table 2),  dismissal rates (p<.05, model 1b, table 2), and total turnover (p<.001, model 1c, table 2).  Compared to nonunion workplaces, the average union workplace has a 9 percentage point lower  quit rate, a 4 percentage point lower dismissal rate, and a 13 percentage point lower total  turnover rate. The association between union representation and lower quit rates supports  26  predictions from exit-voice theory that the union collective voice mechanism will reduce the use  of the exit option of quitting in response to dissatisfaction  (Freeman, 1980). This theory may also  explain the negative association between union representation and dismissals as the voice  mechanism may allow employees to correct poor performance  before it leads to dismissal.  Alternatively, it can be explained by just cause protections and effective  union grievance  procedures, which reduce the ability of management to dismiss employees (Colvin 2003).  Also of interest is that establishments in labor markets with higher unemployment  have  significantly higher dismissal rates (p<.001, model 1b, table 2). Managers in these contexts may  feel more latitude to dismiss under-performing  or marginal employees as the local labor market  provides a ready supply of potential replacements. Among other controls, establishments that  employ a higher educated workforce have significantly lower dismissal rates (p<.001, model 1a,  table 2), perhaps reflecting better job performance by employees with higher education or  managerial assumptions that more educated workers are more trainable. Also, as anticipated,  selection practices are significant: Organizations with higher selection ratios (lower selectivity in  hiring) have significantly  higher quits (p<.05, model 1a, table 2), higher dismissals (p<.01,  model 1b, table 2), and higher total turnover (p<.01, model 1c, table 2).  In a series of additional analyses (not shown) we explored the effects of other control  variables.  These included measures of differences  in the types of services and sales that a center  offers, as well as the level of competitiveness of the product market, which Bloom and Van  Reenan (2006) show to be a powerful predictor of the adoption of good management practices.  (Our competitiveness measure was whether the market was local/regional, national, or  international in scope).  These controls were not significant  and did not change our findings. We  also included a dummy variable in the longitudinal analyses for those establishments that had  27  switched to commission pay between the two time periods (11 percent of the sample).  We found  no significant  effect  and the findings did not change, suggesting that quits are not entirely driven  by lower performing employees who quit because of the introduction of a new system.  - Table 3 about here –  We now turn to the analysis of our longitudinal data, which enables us to examine whether  the use of HR practices in one time period has an effect  on subsequent turnover. Turnover rates  from our 2003 sample are regressed on lagged HR practice indexes from our 1998 sample. The  five year lag period between the surveys in our study is longer than some other longitudinal  studies. This has the disadvantage that if effects attenuate over time, it will be less likely that we  will find significant  effects of our 1998 predictors on our 2003 outcomes. At the same time, the  relatively longer lag period makes for a more conservative test of our hypotheses, increasing our  confidence that any significant  effects we find are causal in nature.  The results of the longitudinal analysis mirror those found in Table 2, but as expected, the  significance  levels are lower given the much smaller sample size of 93 establishments. The  lagged high involvement work index is associated with significantly  lower quits (p<.05, table 3),  lower dismissals (though not significantly), and significantly  lower total turnover (p<.10, table  3). The lagged performance-enhancing  index is associated with significantly  higher quits  (p<.001, table 3), higher dismissals (p<.05, table 3), and higher total turnover (p<.001, table 3).  The associations for the lagged investments and inducements index are negative, but not  significant. Thus, the longitudinal analysis supports the results of the cross-sectional analysis for  the effect  of performance-enhancing  practices, and partially supports the effect  of high  involvement work practices. It is noteworthy that the longitudinal results provide some  28  consistent findings, given that we used a relatively conservative test involving a relatively long  (five year) lag period and a considerably smaller sample size.  - Table 4 about here –  In Table 4, we present the results of our analysis of HR practices, turnover, and customer  satisfaction. As in the analyses for turnover, we begin with a base model that includes only the  control variables (model 1), then add the three HR indexes (model 2), and finally the interactions  among the HR indexes (model 3). Our results show only partial support for hypothesis 4a: The  high involvement index has a significant  positive association with customer satisfaction  (p<.01,  model 2, table 4), but the other two indexes are not significant. A one standard deviation increase  in the high-involvement  index is associated with a 0.20 standard deviation increase in customer  satisfaction (model 2, table 4). Also, there are no significant  effects on customer satisfaction  for  two-way interactions between the HR indexes (model 3, table 4) or for a three-way interaction  (analysis not shown), so hypothesis 4b was not supported.  In the next three sets of models in Table 4, we examine the relationship between customer  satisfaction and quit rates (model 4), dismissal rates (model 5), and total turnover (model 6). We  find that organizations with higher quit rates have significantly lower customer satisfaction  rates  (p<.05); those with higher total turnover (quits and dismissals combined) have significantly  lower customer satisfaction (p<.05).  The relationship between dismissals alone and customer  satisfaction  is negative, but not significant. In terms of effect  sizes, a one standard deviation  increase in total turnover (i.e. an increase of 24.2 percentage points in the rate of quits plus  dismissals) is associated with a 0.12 standard deviation decrease in customer satisfaction.  These  findings are consistent with hypothesis 5a, (which predicted that organizations with higher  dismissals would have lower customer satisfaction). Model 6 also examines whether total  29  turnover mediates the relationship between the HR practices and customer satisfaction.  Recall  that all three HR indices are significantly related to total turnover (Table 2), and only the high  involvement work index is significantly related to customer satisfaction (Table 4, model 2).  We find that total turnover partially mediates the relationship between high involvement  work organization and customer satisfaction. Following the standard mediation test procedures  (Baron & Kenny, 1986; Muller, Judd & Yzerbyt, 2005), the high involvement index was a  significant  predictor of customer satisfaction  (step 1 of the mediation test, model 2, table 4) and a  significant  predictor of total turnover (step 2, model 2c, table 2). When both the high  involvement index and total turnover are included in the model, total turnover is a  significant  predictor of customer satisfaction  (step3, model 6, table 4). When total turnover is included as a  control (step 4), the coefficient  of the high involvement index on customer satisfaction  is smaller  in absolute value (26.3=>23.8, models 2 and 6, table 4). Therefore, hypothesis 5b is supported  for the high involvement work index, but not for the other HR indexes, which were not  significantly related to customer  satisfaction.  Additional Analyses  Although we focus our analysis on our three employment systems indexes, as a check on  the robustness of our findings we also estimated models using the individual practices that make  up these indexes. These results are shown in Appendix 2 and provide additional confirmation of  our general findings. The relationships for almost all of the individual practices are in the same  direction as for the indexes (with the exception of relative pay) and a large number of them are  significant, albeit given that practices in the same index are capturing similar effects it is  unsurprising that there is loss of significance  for some variables in the full model. One notable  finding is that both electronic monitoring and commission pay have significant  positive  effects  30  on quits, dismissals, and total turnover, which corresponds to our hypotheses and findings for the  performance-enhancing  practice index. This provides some additional support for our argument  that these two practices have similar effects and can be linked together.  In separate analyses (not shown), we further  examined our assumption that the commission  pay variable has a linear relationship to the outcomes of interest by creating a series of dummies  for different  levels of pay at risk (none; 1-9%;  10-25%; 26-50%; 51-100%).  It could be, for  example, that people who are less risk averse would self-select  into jobs with high levels of  commission pay (over 50%) and quit less because they are rewarded with higher pay.  This was  not the case.  Relative to no pay at risk (the largest group), each of the 3 groups representing the  highest levels of pay at risk (10-25%; 26-50%; 51-100%) had significantly  higher quits,  dismissals, and total turnover and the magnitude of the coefficients  for the groups increased as  the level of pay at risk increased.  Even the first group representing the smallest amount of pay at  risk (1-9%), which was not significant  for quits, did have significantly higher dismissals.  Thus  our results suggest that commission pay does have a linear relationship with quits, dismissals,  and total turnover.  We also explored whether the turnover-performance  relationship takes on different  forms.  Some researchers have called for analyses to provide a full empirical record of alternative  possibilities, even when the theoretical arguments are ambiguous (Glebbeek and Bax (2004)  argued that a curvilinear relationship should always be tested). The research record is mixed on  whether the turnover-performance  relationship is linear, curvilinear, or contingent on other  factors (Alexander et al., 1994; Kacmar et al., 2006; Shaw, Gupta, & Delery, 2005; Siebert &  Zubanov, 2009). In analyses not shown, we added a squared term for turnover to the turnover- performance equation and found no evidence of a curvilinear relationship. This is consistent with  31  a recent study by Siebert and Zubanov (2009), who found a negative linear relationship between  turnover and performance  for core workers, but a curvilinear one for part-time workers who were  a secondary workforce. As our study is of ‘core workers’, our findings of a negative linear  relationship are consistent with this recent study.  Some also have argued that turnover should moderate the HR-performance  relationship  because turnover should be more costly for organizations that have invested more in the  workforce. Again, the research record is mixed on this point (Arthur, 1994; Shaw et al., 2005b;  Ton & Huckman, 2008). In analyses not shown, we included interaction terms between total  turnover and each of the three HR indices. Among the three interaction terms, one reached a  modest level of significance (p<.10): the interaction of turnover and the high involvement index  was negatively related to customer satisfaction. This would suggest that the lower the total  turnover rate, the stronger the effect  of the high-involvement work index on customer  satisfaction. Put differently,  high turnover would appear to weaken the performance  enhancing  effect  of the high-involvement system. At a relatively low total turnover rate of 12.6 percent (a  one-half  standard deviation lower than the mean), an increase of one standard deviation in the  high-involvement  index produces a 0.30 standard deviation increase in customer  satisfaction.  Meanwhile, at a relatively high total turnover rate of 36.8 percent (corresponding to one-half  standard deviation greater than the mean rate), the same increase of one standard deviation in the  work organization index produces only a 0.13 standard deviation increase in customer  satisfaction. Given the modest level of significance  for the interaction term, however, these  findings should be interpreted with caution.  DISCUSSION  32  In this study we took an employment systems approach to understanding how human  resource practices affect  turnover and performance. We found that quits and dismissals have  similar antecedents in HR practices.  First, employers that made greater use of high involvement  work organization had significantly  lower quits, dismissals, and total turnover. Second, those that  invested more in the workforce and offered  long term incentives (internal promotion  opportunities, high relative pay, pensions, and full-time jobs) had significantly  lower quits,  dismissals, and total turnover. Third, those workplaces featuring higher short-term  performance  pressures (intensive performance monitoring and commission-based pay) had  significantly  higher rates of quits, dismissals, and total turnover. Analyses using longitudinal data with lagged  HR variables from time 1 predicting quits, dismissals, and total turnover at time 2 provided  consistent evidence for these relationships. Since effects tend to attenuate over time, the use of a  relatively long five year lag period provided a conservative test of our hypotheses and enhances  the likelihood that the relationships we did find are causal in nature. Finally, employers who  made greater use of high involvement work organization had significantly  higher customer  satisfaction rates, while those with higher quits and higher total turnover had significantly  lower  satisfaction rates.  Whereas past research has generally theorized, and sometimes found, that quits and  dismissals have distinct antecedents, we found the opposite to be true. The explanation we  proposed is that employers view the level of turnover as a strategic variable that contributes to  operational performance and they may achieve different  turnover levels via the use of HR  practices. We argued that high involvement work organization may, in effect, raise all boats:  Employees quit less because their involvement in operational decisions and problem-solving  creates more engaging and satisfying  jobs; novices and poor performers benefit  from the  33  structure of learning and motivation created through team-based forms of work.  Similarly,  drawing on logic of internal labor market theory, as well as efficiency  wage theory, we argued  that high relative pay and long-term incentives motivate all employees to avoid shirking – the  less proficient  as well as the more proficient  -- because their current job is far more desirable  than the external alternatives. Finally, HR practices that enhance performance  expectations  produce higher quits, as others have argued and found (Shaw et al., 1998), as well as higher  dismissals, as the enhanced criteria expose employees who can’t keep up.  Notably, our analyses controlled for alternative explanations related to the human capital  level of the workforce and the selectivity of hiring practices. In particular, although we found  that having a highly educated workforce and hiring a relatively small proportion of applicants are  both associated with better performance, high involvement work practices were associated with  higher levels of customer satisfaction even when we took into account these human capital  related factors.  Similarly, the turnover-performance  literature generally has theorized that quits and  dismissals should have opposite effects on performance, but the slim empirical evidence that  exists does not support this theory.  Our study contributes positive evidence that the combined  level of quits and dismissals is significantly  negatively related to customer satisfaction. This  finding is consistent with the argument we made that quits and dismissals both contribute to  operational disruption, which incurs the costs of replacing lost employees and undermines stable  social relationships that provide the basis for workplace trust and collaboration, or social capital  (Leana & Van Buren III, 1999).  To make sense of our findings, it may also be useful to put them in the context of the call  center sector, as we have argued that we believe the dynamics of turnover are highly  influenced  34  by the context in which organizations operate. While call centers have a widespread reputation of  being ‘electronic sweatshops’, employing low-skilled workers with little attachment to the labor  force, in fact we observed a considerable range of variation in business and HR strategies and  turnover in the centers we visited.  This variation is evident in the descriptive statistics in this  study.  The average call center in 2003 offered  annual wages of $33,794, with a standard  deviation of $17,292. The telecommunications and banking industries, which are lead users of  call centers and represent a large proportion of establishments in this study, have deep legacies of  internal labor market practices that have not been entirely eroded.  Call centers in the  telecommunications sector continue to have high unionization rates (33 percent among call  center workers), with particularly low quits, dismissals, and overall turnover.  While we cannot empirically link our analysis to the business strategies of companies, our  analysis may be picking up differentiation  in employment systems and turnover related to  differences  in the competitive choices that establishments are making. Centers competing on  customer loyalty may emphasize low turnover in order to provide high quality, stable, on-going  services to customers. They are likely to invest in high involvement work organization and long- term incentives and downplay monitoring and commission pay because the value proposition is  based on long-term customer relationships, not on the quick sell. Other call centers compete on  high volume, low-cost interactions, leading them to emphasize a Taylorized approach to work  design in which the estimated costs of turnover are low because low-skilled labor is viewed as  replaceable.  In our study, high total turnover was associated with lower customer satisfaction  –  but this outcome may not be as important to those centers that compete primarily on low costs.  To the extent that these establishments compete on short-term sales, the intensification of short- term performance expectations may be particularly  beneficial.  35  This explanation dovetails with the findings of a recent study of retail, a similar context to  call centers, by Sierbert and Zubanov (2009). They differentiated  between high commitment and  secondary work systems within the same organization and showed that turnover in the secondary  system was positive for performance at low levels, but eventually turned negative. Similarly, our  findings may be driven by two types of systems operating in different  establishments – a high  commitment system with low overall turnover, focused on quality and customer loyalty, and a  secondary system with high turnover in centers competing primarily on costs.  There are several limitations to this study. The findings from the call center sector may not  generalize to industries with different  product and labor market conditions, technologies, skill  requirements and work organization.  Future research could valuably extend the current analysis  to other industries and occupational groups. This study took an organization-level approach, but  future research would benefit  from multi-level analyses linking the individual and the workplace.  A multi-level approach would also help sort out issues of causality, which we could only  address to a limited degree through our lagged model for the longitudinal data. We used a  relatively long five-year  lag period, which increases the likelihood that effects are not due to  simple correlations of variables over short periods of time, but increases the problem that the  actual causal effects  will become attenuated with time and hence less observable. This raises a  larger question, which has not been adequately theorized in the literature, regarding what should  be the appropriate time lag for testing a causal model of the relationship between HR practices  and outcomes; and of course, this question will also depend on which HR practices and what  types of outcomes.  For studies of turnover, how long does it take for an employee to become  dissatisfied  with an employment system and quit?  An ideal research design would track  individual employees over time and conduct periodic surveys of stayers and leavers, which could  36  be aggregated to the organizational level. This approach would also go beyond an analysis of  aggregate separation rates to include a more fine-grained  study of how quits and dismissals  affect  the overall capacity of the organization to function  and why. Another area for future research is  to examine whether there is variation in the types of workers quitting or being dismissed under  different  types of employment systems. Future research, particularly if it combined  organizational and individual level data, could examine the characteristics of the workers  involved in turnover and see how this affects organizational outcomes.  Finally, a general limitation of this study is that the data are based on reports from  the  general manager at each establishment, so we are unable to check for inter-rater reliability.  However, the typical establishment in this study was small, and our measures are mostly based  on objective information within the ready knowledge of respondents, which was investigated in  fieldwork  prior to the survey. Also, for this nationally-representative sample of establishments,  we could not gather objective performance data, rendering our performance models only  suggestive. However, our approach compares favorably to the other studies of voluntary and  involuntary turnover that have been published to date – which rely on cross-sectional data and  single establishment respondents (Donaghue and Castle, 2006; Shaw et al., 2005b, study 1).  CONCLUSION  Our study advances the past literature in two main areas. First, contrary to past research in  this area, we found strong similarities in the antecedents of both quits and dismissals, suggesting  that they are influenced  by common processes relating to the type of employment system that  exists in each workplace. Second, we found that quits and dismissals combined are  significantly  negatively related to customer  satisfaction.  37  We want to emphasize that we are not challenging the notion that the dynamics of quits and  dismissals may be different  when we examine individual-level behavior or other industry  contexts. And clearly, the dismissal of individual employees for poor performance may improve  organizational performance  if they are replaced by more capable individuals. Rather we are  arguing that at the organizational level, the dynamics of quits and dismissals, and their  antecedents and consequences, are contingent on many factors. This study presents a plausible  theory and suggestive evidence that the relationship between HR practices, quits, and dismissals  may function  in similar ways in some circumstances. An employment systems lens shifts the unit  of analysis to the organization and considers the ways in which employers may view overall  turnover as part of the HR system – a set of tools to manage not only performance but headcount  levels. The idea that employers search for ‘the optimal level of turnover’ (Siebert & Zubanov  2009) is an emerging idea, worthy of further  investigation. Thus, we believe that the  different  results that we have found provide the basis for future research that may examine these  relationships with more precision and rigor and with other industries, occupations, and  organizational contexts.  38  REFERENCES  Abelson, M. & Baysinger, B. 1984.
