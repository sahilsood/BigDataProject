PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  1993,46  THE  RELATIONSHIP OF  STAFFING  PRACTICES TO  ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL MEASURES OF  PERFORMANCE  Department of Management and Marketing  DAVID E. TERPSTRA  University of Mississippi  ELIZABETH J. ROZELL  Department of Management  Missouri Southern State College  Scholars have noted the relative lack of  research on the contribution  of  effective staffing practices to organizational level measures of  per-  formance (Schmitt & Schneider, 1983). We collected survey data from  the heads of the HRM departments of 201 organizations regarding the  extent of  use of five staffing practices supported by the academic liter-  ature.  We also investigated whether organizations that used more of  these practices had higher levels of  profitability and sales growth than  organizations that used fewer of  them. We found a significant positive  relationship  between organizations’ use  of  the five staffing practices  and both annual profit and profit growth across all industries.  How-  ever, the strength of  the relationship between the use of  the staffing  practices and organizational performance was found to vary by industry  type. We also found that the extent of  use of the staffing practices was  related to both industry type and organizational size.  Our study pro-  vides some initial data on the possible positive impact of  these staffing  practices on organizational level outcomes.  In recent years, a number of scholars have stressed the need to view  human resource management (HRM) from a strategic perspective. The  emphasis has been  on linking HRM practices to strategy in  order to  increase organizational competitiveness and effectiveness (Dyer, 1983;  Ferris, Schellenberg, & Zammuto, 1984; Mercer, 1989; Schuler & Jack-  son, 1987a; Smith-Cook & Ferris, 1986). Additionally, there has been  interest in more research that examines the relationship of specific HRM  practices to measures of performance at the organizational level of anal-  ysis  (Kleiner, Block, Roomkin, & Salsburg, 1987; Russell, Terborg, &  Powers,  1985; Schmitt & Schneider, 1983).

Schmitt and Schneider (1983), for example, have noted the relative lack  of research on the contribution of HRM selection procedures to organi-  zational outcomes of interest, and have outlined an agenda for research  to rectify this problem. Their suggested research agenda includes defin-  ing the organizational ievel criteria of  importance, surveying organiza-  tions and assessing their use of specific selection practices, assessing the  surveyed organizations on the various criteria selected, and then corre-  lating the two sets of  organizational assessments.  Data collection and  measurement is more difficult at the organizational level of analysis, and  greater noise and threats to validity at this level make it harder to assess  the actual contribution of  a given HRM practice to firm performance.  However, as Russell et al. (1985) have stated, this should not deter re-  search on the utility of specific HRM practices at the organizational level  of analysis. The finding of a positive relationship between a given HRM  practice and organizational performance may constitute useful initial ev-  idence of  the potential  utility of  that practice and serve as a guide to  future research.  Schuler and Jackson (1987a) organized HRM practices into five ba-  sic areas:  (1) planning, (2) staffing, (3) appraising, (4)  compensating,  and (5) training and development.  Our study is focused on the staffing  area (recruitment and selection), and  addresses Schmitt and  Schnei-  der’s (1983) call for more research on the relationship between selection  practices and organizational level outcomes. The use and effectiveness  of  some HRM practices is presumed to vary across organizations due  to different strategies, organizational characteristics, and external fac-  tors (Cleveland, Murphy, & Williams, 1989; Jackson, Schuler, & Rivero,  1989; Saari, Johnson, McLaughlin, & Zimmerle, 1988). The use of  ef-  fective staffing practices, however, might benefit most organizations, re-  gardless of varying internal or external contingency factors. Schuler and  Jackson (1987b), for example, have suggested that, “all (organizations  may) find it most useful to select individuals using valid as opposed to  invalid selection tests” (p. 126).  Our study investigated the relationship between the use of five staffing  practices and organizational level measures of performance. These five  staffing practices were  (1)  the  use  of  follow-up studies of  recruiting  sources to determine which sources yield greater proportions of  high-  performing employees, (2) the use of validation studies for the predictors  used in selection, (3) the use of structured, standardized interviews for  selection, (4) the use of cognitive aptitude and ability tests for selection,  and (5) the use of  biographical information blanks (BIBS) or weighted  application blanks (WABs) for selection.  TERPSTRA AND ROZELL  29  The five staffing practices were chosen for inclusion in our study on  the basis of  two criteria:  (1) the academic literature suggests that the  practice should lead to increased levels of  employee performance, and  (2) the practice is infrequently employed by  organizations, in general.  HRM practices which  are capable of  positively influencing employee  performance would seem to be worthy candidates for study.  If enough  evidence begins to accumulate which shows a link between some of these  practices and organizational level measures of performance, more orga-  nizations might be encouraged to adopt them. This, in turn, could pos-  sibly lead to enhanced competitiveness for these firms.  A brief review  of  each of the five staffing practices and the specific research questions  addressed in our study follows.  Review and Research Questions  Recruiting Studies  As the quality of recruits turned up through various sources appears  to vary significantly, most HRM texts (e.g.,  Cascio,  1989; Heneman,  Schwab, Fossum, & Dyer, 1989) advise organizations to carefully mon-  itor and track the effectiveness of  the recruiting sources that they uti-  lize. However, Rynes and Boudreau (1986) surveyed Fortune loo0 firms  and found that only 7% reported that they tried to track the relative  performance levels of  employees recruited through different sources.  Some research exists that suggests that informal recruiting sources yield  higher quality or higher performing employees than formal recruiting  sources (Breaugh,  1981; Kirnan, Farley, & Geisinger, 1989).  Yet,  in  any given organizational setting, one would expect that some recruit-  ing sources would be differentially effective. Thus, organizations should  benefit from follow-up studies that examine the link between their re-  cruitment practices and post-hire effectiveness.  Validation Studies  Nearly 10 years ago, a survey of 437 organizations indicated that only  16% of  the respondents validated one or more of  their selection tech-  niques (Bureau of  National Affairs, 1983). However, the productivity-  related gains associated with the use of validation studies to identify valid  predictors may be quite substantial.  Utility analyses conducted in di-  verse organizational settings suggest that validation information and the  use of valid selection devices can result in millions of dollars in annual  productivity increases for some organizations (Arnold, Rauschenberger,  Soubel, & Guion, 1982; Brown, 1981; Cascio & Ramos, 1986; Schmidt,  30  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  Hunter, McKenzie, & Muldrow, 1979; Schmidt, Hunter, Outerbridge,  & Trattner, 1986; Terborg & Russell, 1988).  Structured Interviews  The Bureau of  National Affairs (1983) survey found that approxi-  mately 70% of  the sampled organizations employed unstructured inter-  views, while only approximately 30% employed structured interviews. A  more recent, but smaller survey conducted by  the Bureau of  National  Affairs (1988) reported that 35%  of  the respondents  used  structured  interviews.  Generally speaking, the predictive validity of  the interview  is modest ( k e y  & Campion, 1982; Hunter & Hunter, 1984; Reilly &  Chao,  1982; Schmitt, 1976).  The degree of  structure of  the selection  interview does, however, appear to be an important moderator (Gate-  wood & Feild, 1987). Several studies have demonstrated the superiority  of structured interviews over unstructured interviews in terms of predic-  tive validity (Campion, Pursell, & Brown, 1988; Weisner & Cronshaw,  1988; Wright, Lichtenfels, & Pursell, 1989). Thus, the use of structured  interviews for selection purposes would seem to offer organizations po-  tentially significant increases in employee performance and productivity.  Cognitive Aptitude and Ability Tests  The 1983 Bureau of  National Affairs survey also reported that only  about 20% of  the sampled organizations used cognitive ability tests in  selection (Bureau of  National Affairs, 1983).  The smaller 1988 survey  found that 31% of the respondents administered mental ability tests in  the selection process (Bureau of  National Affairs,  1988).  Reviews of  the validity evidence associated with cognitive aptitude and ability tests  indicate that they successfully predict performance for many types of  jobs and occupations (Ghiselli, 1966; Ghiselli, 1973).  In fact, some re-  search suggests that no other methods of selection are superior to men-  tal ability tests in terms of  overall utility (Reilly & Chao,  1982).  Sev-  eral meta-analytic studies have also claimed to demonstrate the overall  superiority of  cognitive ability tests over alternative selection methods  (Hunter & Hunter, 1984; Pearlman, Schmidt, & Hunter, 1980; Schmidt,  Gast-Rosenberg, & Hunter,  1980; Schmidt, Hunter, & Caplan, 1981).  Schmidt et al. (1986) conducted a utility analysis, and estimated that the  use of valid cognitive ability tests in place of less valid selection methods  for white-collar jobs in the federal government would lead to increases  in output worth nearly $600 million annually for every year the new hires  remain on the job.  TERPSTRA AND ROZELL  31  BIBS and WABs  The Bureau of National Affairs (1983) survey estimated the extent of  use of  BIBS or WABs as being approximately 11%. Despite the relative  lack of use of these selection procedures, they appear to be good predic-  tors of performance (Brown, 1978; Rothstein, Schmidt, Erwin, Owens,  & Sparks, 1990).  Comprehensive reviews of  the validity evidence as-  sociated with BIBSWABS have demonstrated that they are among the  more predictive tools available for selection purposes (Asher & Sciar-  rho, 1974; Henry, 1966; Hunter & Hunter, 1984; Owens, 1976; Owens  & Henry, 1966; Reilly & Chao, 1982). Reilly and Chao (1982) concluded  that only BIBS (and peer evaluations) compared favorably with cogni-  tive/mental ability tests in terms of validity. Cascio (1976) made an even  stronger statement in support of the use of BIBsWABs when he noted  that “compelling evidence exists that when appropriate procedures are  followed, the accuracy of biographical data as a predictor of  future be-  havior is superior to any known alternatives” (p. 576).  Research Questions  Schmitt and Schneider (1983) have noted the relative lack of research  on the relationship of staffing practices to organizational level outcomes,  and have suggested a research agenda to correct this informational de-  ficiency. The primary purpose of our study was to provide some initial  data on the relationship between the use of  five staffing practices and  organizational performance.  In line with Schmitt and Schneider’s rec-  ommended research agenda, we  surveyed organizations and assessed  their  use of  specific selection practices (recruiting studies, validation  studies, structured interviews, cognitive aptitude and ability tests, and  BIBsWABs), assessed the surveyed organizations on selected organiza-  tional criteria (annual profit, profit growth, and sales growth), and then  examined the relationship between the two sets of organizational assess-  ments. On the basis of our previous review of the five staffing practices,  we hypothesized that firms that employed more of these practices would  have higher levels of annual profit, profit growth, and sales growth than  firms that employed fewer of  these practices.  We assumed, as did Schuler and Jackson (1987b), that the use of ef-  fective staffing practices would benefit most organizations, regardless of  their differing internal or external contingencies.  Still, the relative de-  gree of benefit might vary as a function of such characteristics as indus-  try type. Industry type might moderate the relationship between the use  of effective staffing practices and organizational level outcomes. Staffing  32  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  practices designed to secure the best employees possible might, for ex-  ample, have less impact on organizational performance in the manufac-  turing industry than in other, more labor intensive, industries because of  greater constraints imposed on employee performance by the degree of  automation of the production technology or the degree of task structure  in the manufacturing industry.  Additionally, in the manufacturing in-  dustry, human resources represent only one of a number of important in-  puts. Materials and the production technology and equipment represent  equally important inputs in the manufacturing industry. Conversely, in  the service industry, the impact of effective staffing practices upon orga-  nizational outcomes might be more pronounced because service organi-  zations’ employees are the primary input or resource, and because fewer  constraints on individual levels of performance presumably exist than in,  say, the manufacturing industry. Thus, we addressed the research ques-  tion of whether the strength of the relationship between the use of the  five staffing practices and organizational performance might vary across  different industries. Given the lack of  guiding empirical literature, no  specific hypotheses were tested in regard to this research question.  A secondary objective of our study was to assess the degree to which  organizations employed effective staffing practices, and to compare our  findings regarding the extent of use of each of the five staffing practices to  previous survey estimates. We also sought to determine whether indus-  try type or organizational size (number of employees) might be related  to differences in the extent of use of these five staffing practices. Previous  literature has suggested that these two characteristics may influence or-  ganizations’ use of other HRM practices (Cleveland et al., 1989; Jackson  et al.,  1989; Saari et al., 1988). As such, we investigated the possibility  that industry type and size might be related to differences in the extent  of  organizations’ use of the five staffing practices. These investigations  were primarily exploratory. Therefore, we did not develop a priori hy-  potheses regarding the relationship between these two variables and the  extent of use of  the five staffing practices.  Method  Sample  A random sample of 1,OOO U.S. companies with 200 or more employ-  ees was drawn from Dun’s Business Rankings (1989).  This publication  contains information on over 7,500 public and private U.S.  companies.  Dun’s Business Runkings lists company-specific data on such characteris-  tics as industry type, number of employees, and sales volume. Dun’s lists  primary and secondary Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes  TERPSTRA AND ROZELL  33  (U.S. Office of Management and Budget, 1987); and the industry cate-  gory into which a company is placed is determined by  its primary SIC  code which reflects its principal business activity. Firms with fewer than  200 employees were excluded from the sampling procedure as these  firms do not typically have formalized HRM positions or departments  (Heneman et al.,  1989; Miner & Miner,  1985).  Questionnaires were  mailed to the heads of  the HRM departments of  the  1,OOO  organiza-  tions in late 1990.  One hundred six of  the mailed questionnaires were  returned to sender due to incorrect or outdated mailing addresses (some  companies were no longer in business).  Of the 894 firms that received  our questionnaire, 201 completed and returned it for a response rate of  22.5%.  Ninety-four percent of the respondents were HRM heads or ex-  ecutives, and the remaining 6% were either CEOs or owners. Seventy-  nine percent of  the’ respondents were men and 21% were women, and  their mean age was 45.01. They had an average of 15.95 years’ experience  in the HRM field, and an average of 5.22 years’ tenure in their current  positions. The mean salary of the respondents was $77,664.11. It might  be noted that exploratory correlational analyses revealed no significant  relationships between any of the above respondent variables and either  performance or use of the staffing practices. Although the adjusted re-  sponse rate was somewhat low, a comparison of  the firms that did and  did not respond to our questionnaire suggests that they were similar.  Analyses indicated that there were no significant differences between  respondents and non-respondents in terms of industry type, number of  employees, or sales volume (using 1989 data obtained from Dun’s Busi-  ness Rankings).  The distribution of responding firms by major industry category was  as follows: manufacturing-46 % , service-1  3 % , wholesalehet ail-1  6%,  transportation/communicationd%,  and agricultural/  financial-12%,  mining/construction-7%.  The distribution of  respondents by number  of  employees (using 1990 data obtained from the current survey) was:  1,000 to 4,999-41%,  5,000 to  less than 200-1%,  200  to 999-33%,  9,999-lo%,  10,000 to 24,999-lo%,  25,000 to 49,999-3%,  and 50,000  (Tho firms which Dun’s Business Rankings listed as em-  or more-3%.  ploying 200 or more employees in 1989 employed slightly fewer than 200  in 1990 according to our survey data).  The distribution of  responding  firms by 1990 sales volume (using data gathered from the current survey)  was:  less than  1 million-1%,  1 to 9 million-2%,  19%, 100 to 499 million-46%, 500 to 999 million-  13%, and 1 billion  or more-19%.  10 to 99 million-  34  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  Questionnaire and Measures  A cover letter attached to the questionnaire stated the type of infor-  mation sought, and assured the respondents of the confidentiality of the  data to be collected.  Measurement of staffing practices.  One section of  the questionnaire  was  designed to gather information regarding the organizations’ em-  ployment of  the five staffing practices.  In this section, the respondents  were asked the following five questions: (1) Does your organization con-  duct follow-up studies of  recruiting sources (e.g.,  direct applications,  employee referrals, college recruiting, want ads, etc.)  for any jobs to  determine which sources yield greater proportions of  high-performing  employees? (2) Does your organization conduct validation studies (e.g.,  predictive, concurrent, content, synthetic, validity generalization) on the  tests or predictors used in selection for any jobs? (3) Does your organi-  zation use structured, standardized interviews (as opposed to unstruc-  tured interviews) for selection for any jobs? (4) Does your organization  use intelligence tests (or cognitive or mental ability tests) for selection  for any jobs? and (5) Does your organization use biographical informa-  tion blanks or weighted application blanks for selection for any jobs? For  each of the above five questions, the respondents were asked to circle ei-  ther “Yes” or “No” (coded as 1 and 0, respectively). Responses to each  of the questions were standardized ( z  transformed) and added together  to create a total staffing index, which served as the primary independent  variable. The internal consistency reliability of this index was .44.  Measurement of organizational Performance. Another section of  the  questionnaire asked the respondents to provide data regarding the per-  formance of their organizations. Tho questions related to organizational  profit asked the respondents to indicate both their firms’ profit margin  in 1990 and their firms’ average annual growth in profit over the 5-year  period 19861990. The profit categories provided for the respondents  on the questionnaire for these two questions were:  (1) loss, (2) break-  even, (3) 14%, (4) 5-9%,  (5) 10-14%,  (6) 15-19%,  (7) 20-24%,  and (8)  25% or more. Another performance-related question asked the respon-  dents to indicate their firms’ average annual sales growth over the 5-year  period 19861990. The categories provided for this question were:  (1)  declining, (2) 14%, (3) 5-9%, (4) 10-14%,  (5) 15-19%,  (6) 2049%, (7)  50-99%,  and (8) 100% or more. An overall performance index or mea-  sure was also created by standardizing the responses to the three above-  mentioned performance measures and adding them together. The inter-  nal consistency reliability of this overall measure was .77.  Measures related to stock performance or market returns were not  employed in  the current study.  Nearly half  of  the respondents were  TERPSTRA AND ROZELL  35  private companies or private subsidiaries. Also, several of  the publicly  traded firms included in our sample were public subsidiaries, over-the-  counter companies (or subsidiaries of over-the-counter companies), or  U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-held parents. A review of CRSP, Compustat,  and 10-K disclosure information sources yielded data on no more than  61 of  the publicly traded firms in our sample.  'Ib assess the reliability of the three measures of organizational per-  formance (1990 profit, 5-year profit growth, and 5-year sales growth)  gathered via our questionnaire, similar information on 61 publicly traded  firms in  our  sample was  obtained  from  10-K disclosure data listings  (Compact Disclosure, 1991). Data on 1990 profit, 5-year profit, and 5-  year sales growth for these 61 companies were translated into the cat-  egories employed in the questionnaire;  and the degree of  agreement  between these classifications and the questionnaire classifications was  computed to be 91%, 84%, and 78%, respectively.  Simple correlation  coefficients were also computed to assess the reliability of  the classifi-  cations of  1990 profit, 5-year profit, and 5-year sales growth, and the  coefficients for these three measures were .98, .96, and .95, respectively.  Measurement of  industry type and employees. The questionnaire also  asked the respondents to indicate the industry classification of their orga-  nization. The previously mentioned categories (manufacturing, service,  wholesale/retail, financial, transportationkommunication, and agricul-  tural/mining/construction) were developed from the classifications pro-  vided by  the Standard Industrial Classification Manual (U.S. Office of  Management and Budget, 1987).  The respondents were also asked to  indicate the current (1990) number of  employees in their organization  using the following categories: (1) less than 200, (2) 200-999,  (3) 1,OOO-  4,999,  (4) 5,000-9,999,  (5)  10,000-24,999, (6) 25,000-49,999,  and  (7)  50,000 or more.'  The reliability of  the questionnaire measures of  industry type and  number of employees was again assessed with the use of such informa-  tion obtained from 10-K disclosure data (Compact Disclosure, 1991) on  'The  scale categories for number of  employees (as well as for the performance mea-  sures) differed in terms of  range size.  To  check whether these departures from linearity  had an effect on our analyses and results, we straightened our scales by using the midpoints  of  the ranges of our original categories and repeated all of our analyses. The results ob-  tained with the original categorical values and those obtained with the converted values  were essentially the same; thus, we  chose to report the results based on our original cat-  egorical values. Moderate departures from linearity in scaling had Little influence on the  methods of analysis and findings in this instance. Still, in future studies it may be better to  gather data in continuous form to avoid any potential problems associated with non-linear  measurement scales.  36  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  61 publicly traded firms in our sample.  The degree of  agreement be-  tween the classifications developed from this source and the question-  naire classifications was 98% for industry, and 85 % for number of em-  ployees. The simple correlation coefficients for industry and number of  employees were .99 and .96, respectively.  Results  Table  1 presents the means, standard deviations, and intercorrela-  tions for all of  the variables (except industry) employed in the current  study. Table 2 presents the means and standard deviations of the staffing  practices and performance measures within industry classes.  Performance and the Use of  Stajjing Practices  Correlational analyses were employed to examine the relationship  between the total staffing index and the four performance  measures.  Partial correlations controlling for the number of employees were com-  puted, as this variable was significantly related to both the total staffing  index and one of  the performance measures (see Ihble 1). It might be  noted that the .lo and .05 alpha levels were used for significance testing  throughout, given the exploratory nature of the current study.  The re-  sults indicated that organizations that engaged in more of the five staffing  practices had both significantly higher annual profit (partial r = .25, p <  .05) and profit growth (partial T  = .15, p  < .05) than organizations that  engaged in fewer. The relationship between the number of staffing prac-  tices and sales growth was not significant (partial r = .09, n.s.).  The rela-  tionship between the number of  staffing practices used and the measure  of  overall performance, however, was significant (partial r  = .20,  p  <  .05).  Analyses were also conducted to investigate whether the strength of  the relationship between the total staffing index and organizational per-  formance might vary by type of industry. Partial correlations (controlling  for the number of  employees) between the total staffing index and the  four measures of  performance were computed within industry classes,  and are shown in Tmble 3.  The data in Tmble 3 show that the degree of  relationship between  the number of  staffing practices engaged in and the measures of  per-  formance varied considerably from industry to industry.

Because our initial exploratory anal-  yses  indicated that  there was  considerable variance from  industry to  industry, separate regression analyses were conducted within industry  classes.  A hierarchical regression procedure was used, with the num-  ber of employees entered at the first stage of  the analysis.  At the sec-  ond stage, all of the variables (employees and the five staffing practices)  were entered simultaneously. This procedure made it possible to esti-  mate the proportion of  variance explained by the five staffing practices  above and beyond what was accounted for by the control variable (em-  ployees). We controlled for employees because this variable was signif-  icantly related  to some of  the individual staffing practices and perfor-  mance measures (See Table 1).  The results of  the hierarchical multi-  ple regression analyses conducted within industry classes are shown in  Table 4.  The results shown in Table 4 again illustrate the differences  in  the relative contribution of  the use of  the five  staffing practices to  performance across the industry classes (regression equations were not  calculated for either the transportatiodcommunication industry class or  the agricultural/mining/construction industry class because of previously  mentioned sample size restrictions).  In the service industry, the use of  the five staffing practices accounted for a substantial proportion of  the  variance in each of the three individual measures of  performance (an-  nual profit, profit growth, and sales growth), as well as in the composite  or overall performance measure.

In the financial industry class, the use of  the  five staffing practices accounted for a substantial proportion of the vari-  ance in the sales growth measure. In the manufacturing industry, orga-  nizations’ use of  the five staffing practices did not explain a significant  proportion of the variance in any of the four performance measures.  Extent of  Use of Stuffing Practices  Overall, the sampled organizations engaged in an average of 1.36 of  the five staffing practices (with a range of 0-5).  The percentages associ-  ated with the use of each of the individual staffing practices were as fol-  lows (1) recruiting studies-48%, (2) validation studies-24%,  (3) struc-  tured interviews-29%,  17%.  (4) cognitive tests-20%,  and (5) BIBsWABs-  Analyses were conducted to examine whether the total staffing index  (the z  score composite) of  the organizations differed as a function of  industry type. A one-way analysis of variance of  the composite staffing  index by industry type was significant at the .05 level. A Duncan’s multi-  ple range test performed on the composite industry means indicated that  the service industry engaged in more of  the staffing practices (M = .77)  than did the manufacturing (M = -.71)  industry, at the .05 alpha level.  Analyses were also conducted to assess whether the use of each individ-  ual staffing practice varied as a function of  industry type.  The one-way  analysis of variance for recruiting studies was significant, and a Duncan’s  multiple range test performed on the standardized means revealed that  the service industry (M = .48) made greater use of these studies than did  the manufacturing industry (M = -.19),  at the .05 level of significance.  As mentioned previously, the number of  employees correlated posi-  tivelywith the total staffing index (T = .25, p  < .05). Correlational analy-  ses conducted by individual staffing practices revealed that the number of  employees was significantly related with two of the five staffing practices.  Larger firms were significantly more likely to employ validation studies  (r = .29, p  < .05) and cognitive tests (T  = .15, p  < .05) than were smaller  firms. Modest (although nonsignificant) correlations with the number of  employees were observed for the remaining staffing practices (recruiting  studies, T = .13; structured interviews, r = .07; and BIBsWABs, r = .13).  42  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  Discussion  Performance and the Use of Staffing Practices  The primary  objective of  the current study was  to  provide some  initial information regarding the relationship between the use of  five  staffing practices and organizational level outcomes.  We  hypothesized  that organizations that employed relatively more of these practices would  have higher levels of annual profit, profit growth, sales growth, and over-  all performance. The results of our correlational analyses across all in-  dustries confirmed our hypothesis, with the exception of the sales growth  measure. It may be that sales growth is more dependent on external fac-  tors than are the other measures of organizational performance. Profit  and profit growth may be more directly influenced by good staffing prac-  tices.  Our finding of  a positive relationship between the use of effective  staffing practices and organizational profitability is encouraging, and  may constitute some initial evidence of  the ability of these practices to  influence outcomes at the organizational level of  analysis.  Our results  do not allow us to conclude that the use of more of the five staffing prac-  tices studied causes organizations to be more profitable.  It may be the  case that profitable organizations are simply more able to adopt more of  these staffing practices.  However, in view of the previous empirical lit-  erature documenting the positive impact of  these five staffing practices  on performance at the individual level of analysis, it seems more plausi-  ble that the causal arrow runs from adoption to profitability, rather than  from profitability to adoption.  Although we  assumed that  the  use  of  effective staffing practices  would benefit most organizations, regardless of  their varying internal  or external contingencies (Schuler dz Jackson, 1987b), we  also investi-  gated the research question of  whether industry type might influence  the relative degree of  benefit of  the use of these practices.  No specific  hypotheses were advanced, however, we  suspected that we might find  evidence of a relatively stronger relationship between the use of the five  staffing practices and organizational performance in more labor inten-  sive industries such as the service industry.  Our findings partially con-  firmed our suspicions. The correlational results (presented previously  in Table 3) indicated that the strength of  the relationship between the  number of staffing practices engaged in and organizational performance  varied considerably from one industry to the next. In the service and fi-  nancial industries, the use of the five staffing practices was strongly and  significantly correlated with all four measures of organizational perfor-  mance.  TERPSTRA AND ROZELL  43  The results of our hierarchical regression analyses (presented previ-  ously in 'Itible 4) also suggested the possibility of considerable differences  between industries. The strongest relationships between the use of the  five practices and organizational outcomes were found in the service in-  dustry.  The relationship between the use of  effective staffing practices  and organizational performance may be stronger in the service industry  because the success of service organizations would seem to be more di-  rectly dependent upon the nature and quality of  their human resources  than in less labor intensive industries. Good staffing practices should aid  service organizations in securing the best human resources available. In  service organizations, human resources are the primary input; and there  may also be fewer constraints imposed on employee performance in this  industry than in others. Some evidence of a relationship between the use  of the five staffing practices and organizational outcomes was also found  in the wholesale/retail and financial industries, although the support was  not as strong as it was in the service industry.  Once again, in both the  wholesale/retail and financial industries, the quality of the organizations'  human resources would seem to be a critical element of their success.  As such, the use of  effective staffing practices should make some con-  tribution to organizational level outcomes. Little evidence of a relation-  ship between the use of the five staffing practices and organizational out-  comes was found in the manufacturing industry. In the manufacturing  industry, human resources represents only one of a number of important  inputs (other inputs being, for example, materials, equipment, and the  production technology). Furthermore, there may be greater constraints  placed upon employee performance by the degree of  task structure or  the degree of  automation of  the production  technology in this indus-  try.  Thus, it seems plausible that the use of  effective staffing practices  to secure high quality human resources might have relatively less impact  on organizational level outcomes in the manufacturing industry than in  other types of industries.  In general, our findings suggest that the relative degree of  benefit  obtained from the use of  effective staffing practices may, indeed, vary  as a function of  industry class. Future investigations of  the relationship  between staffing (and other  HRM) practices and organizational level  outcomes should probably continue to incorporate the measurement of  industry type into their research methods and designs.  Extent of Use of Staffing Practices  A secondary objective of  our research was to assess the degree to  which organizations employed effective staffing practices, and to com-  pare our findings regarding the extent of use of  each of  the five staffing  44  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  practices to previous survey estimates. We also explored the possibility  that industry type or number of  employees might be related to differ-  ences in the extent of use of these staf3ing practices.  Our findings indicated that the surveyed organizations employed, on  the average, 1.36 of the five staffing practices recommended by the aca-  demic literature.  There appears to be a rather substantial gap between  what the academic literature recommends and what most organizations  actually do. Previous literature has suggested that these staffing practices  can positively influence performance at the individual level of  analysis.  Also, our current findings suggest that the use of these practices may be  positively related to measures of performance at the organizational level  of  analysis. Thus, the gap between the academic literature and practice  may not be inconsequential.  In comparing our data to previous survey estimates, we found some  evidence that organizations’ use of  recruiting studies, validation stud-  ies, and BTBsWABs may have increased. These apparent increases are  encouraging.  However, it is possible that the differences between our  findings and those of  previous surveys may be due to different sampling  procedures. Our response rate was also somewhat low, and perhaps our  respondents were more likely to use effective staffing practices than non-  respondents.  The number of the five staffing practices employed by organizations  differed significantly by industry. The service industry employed more of  the five staffing practices than did the manufacturing industry. It is possi-  ble that manufacturing firms focus relatively more attention toward ma-  terials, equipment, and technology than toward human resources in their  efforts to improve organizational performance and productivity.  Con-  versely, service organizations would be expected to focus more on their  primary resource-their  employees. Our analyses by individual staffing  practices also revealed that service firms made greater use of recruiting  studies than did manufacturing firms.  Our findings also indicated that  the number of  staffing practices employed was significantly related  to  organizational size.  Even though firms with fewer than 200 employees  were excluded from our sampling procedure, we still found that relatively  larger organizations made significantly greater use of  effective staffing  practices. Additional analyses by individual practices revealed that rel-  atively larger firms made greater use of validation studies and cognitive  tests.  In general, our findings regarding industry type and size provide  support for recent literature that emphasizes the need to consider such  organizational context characteristics as significant influences upon the  adoption and use of particular HRM practices (Cleveland et al., 1989;  Jackson et al., 1989; Saari et al., 1988).  TEWSTRA AND ROZELL  Limitatiorw and Directions for Future Research  45  Our primary objective was to provide some initial data on the pos-  sibility of  a relationship between the use of  selected staffing practices  and organizational level outcomes. In line with Schmitt and Schneider’s  (1983) recommendations, we simply assessed organizations as to their  use of staffing practices and as to their standing on organizational level  criteria, and then correlated the two sets of assessments. We did not ad-  dress the issue of causality. Furthermore, the scoring and measurement  of the five staffing practices was, admittedly, quite general and simplistic,  and no evidence of the validity or reliability of these measures was pro-  vided.  Schmitt and Schneider suggested that some quasi-experiments  assessing the effects of  HRM practices might be conducted if the ini-  tial correlational investigation found evidence of a positive relationship  between the practices and organizational level criteria.  Longitudinal  research could also be conducted on organizations that adopt some of  these staffing practices to assess their impact on organizational perfor-  mance.  Such research could more systematically examine the linkages  and paths from the adoption of staffing practices to intermediate mea-  sures of employee performance at the individual level to the final orga-  nizational level outcomes.  Our findings confirm the need to consider and measure key contin-  gency variables in organizational research.  The current study investi-  gated the impact of industry type and organizational size; however, fu-  ture research might investigate other potential organizational and exter-  nal contingency factors.  Effective staffing practices may benefit many  organizations, but as our findings suggest, the relative degree of benefit  may vary as a function of  critical contingency characteristics. Also, the  extent of adoption of staffing practices is quite likely influenced by some  of the above-mentioned variables.  In conclusion, our study addressed the call for more research inves-  tigating the relationship between staffing practices and organizational  level criteria. As Russell et al. (1985) have noted, research of this type  may yield useful initial data that could serve as a guide to future re-  search. Furthermore, it is possible that evidence of  a positive relation-  ship between certain staffing or other HRM practices and organizational  performance may constitute the type of  data needed to encourage orga-  nizational managers and practitioners to adopt effective management  practices.  For example, Cascio (1991) has noted that much of  the re-  search conducted by academics in the HRM field is misunderstood and  underestimated by organizations, partially because much of what we do  is evaluated only in statistical or behavioral terms. Cascio further states,  46  PERSONNEL PSYCHOLOGY  “Like it or not, the language of business is dollars, not correlation co-  efficients” (p. vii).  Research involving assessments related to business’  bottom line may increase the rate of adoption of genuinely useful HRM  practices.  REFERENCES  Arnold JD, Rauschenberger JM, Soubel WG, Guion RM.
