International Journal of Business and Society, Vol. 15 No. 1, 2014, 151 - 170 REVERSE LOGISTICS: PRESSURE FOR ADOPTION AND  THE IMPACT ON FIRM’S PERFORMANCE Nik Ab Halim Nik Abdullah♣ Universiti Utara Malaysia  Sabariah Yaakub Universiti Utara Malaysia  ABSTRACT One of the new challenges faced by Malaysian firms that want to go global is the fact that  many  countries  have  introduced  legislation  or  directives  to  ensure  effective  disposal  of  manufactured products and its waste. Furthermore, the increase in awareness on environmental  issues, sustainable development, corporate citizenship and the benefit of recycling had also  placed more pressure on firms to adopt sustainable business initiatives such as a better reverse  logistics strategy. Manufacturing firms however often focused on forward logistics and as a  result, they tend to overlook at the importance of reverse logistics activities and its potential  of improving the firm’s performance. The objective of this study is to look at the current level  of reverse logistics adoption among manufacturers in Malaysia and to identify the influence  of  customer/stakeholder  pressure,  regulatory  pressure,  financial  and  competitive  pressure,  and corporate citizenship pressure on the level of reverse logistics adoption. In addition, this  study also aims to determine the relationship between reverse logistics adoption level and  firm’s performance. Data was collected through survey questionnaire, and the respondents  consist of managers at manufacturing firms located in the Northern State of Malaysia and the  Klang Valley. 101 samples were collected and data analysis was conducted using the Partial  Least Square (PLS) regression analysis, through SmartPLS 2.0 software. Findings indicate  that the level of reverse logistics adoption among Malaysia manufacturers is considerably  low. Out of four independent variables, only the regulatory pressure has a significantly strong  influence on the level of reverse logistics adoption, while customer and stakeholder pressure  has a significant but moderate influence. No significant relationship was observed between the  level of reverse logistics adoption and firm’s performance.

INTRODUCTION Reverse logistics has been defined as the movement of product or materials in the opposite  direction of the supply chain for the purpose of creating or recapturing value, or for proper  disposal.  It  includes  processing  returned  merchandise  due  to  damage,  seasonal  inventory,  restock, salvage recalls and excess inventory, as well as packaging and shipping materials from  the end user or reseller. It also includes recycling programs, hazardous material programs,  obsolete equipment disposition, and asset recovery (Rogers & Tibben-Lembke, 2001). Manufacturing firms these days often focused on forward logistics and as a result, they tend  to  overlook  at  the  importance  of  reverse  logistics  activities.  Management  usually  was  so  concerned with the inbound movement of material and product to ensure that they can deliver  it efficiently within the required time frame and at the right cost, through their supply chain. As  a result, firms did not acknowledge the importance of having a centralized return centres (CRC)  to process return product and there is also a temptation to redirect reverse logistics personnel  to the forward logistics function when the facility is experiencing high demand (Rogers &  Tibben-Lembke,  1998).  In  addition,  reverse  logistics  should  be  properly  managed  just  as  forward logistics because it is also a cost centre to the company. Minahan (1998) estimated that  reverse logistics activities constitute between 3 to 4% of a company’s total logistics cost. On  the other hand, some forward thinking companies in industries such as electronic equipment,  household appliances, automotive parts, pharmaceuticals and chemicals view reverse logistics  as a significant source of untapped profitability (Anderson, 2009; Jayaraman & Luo, 2007).  Company such as Estee Lauder for example has, after a very successful reverse logistics project  created $250 million product line from its return goods flow. Similarly, Caterpillar investment  in remanufacturing plant in Mississippi that disassembles and rebuilds diesel engines pays off  when the division has become their fastest growing unit with annual revenue tops $1 billion  and is estimated to grow 20% a year (Jayaraman & Luo, 2007). These examples indicate that  proper reverse logistics activities may help firm’s improve the performance. One of the new challenges faced by Malaysian firms that want to go global is the fact that many  countries have introduced legislation or directives to ensure effective disposal of manufactured  products and its waste. Furthermore, the increase in awareness on environmental issues and the  benefit of recycling had also placed more pressure on firms to create a better reverse logistics  strategy. As an example, this is evident in Europe where a new regulation with the objective  to reduce the amount of waste dumped in landfills results in all manufacturers, wholesalers  and retailers all came under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive  in January 2007. Under the terms of the regulations, manufacturers had to join a WEEE  compliance scheme by March 2007, and as of July 2007 had full financial responsibility for  recycling household equipment. As a result, the ability to manage the reverse logistics process  efficiently will definitely become one of the critical factors for manufacturers and retailers  who currently doing business or those who are thinking of going into Europe during the next  couple of years (Scott, 2008). Firms that comply with regulations and stress on environmental  protection will have a good goodwill or corporate citizenship among their customers.  Another  activity  involved  in  firm’s  reverse  logistics  system  besides  managing  product  disposal is the management of after-sales service, which is also a part of customer relationship    Nik Ab Halim Nik Abdullah and Sabariah Yaakub 153 management (CRM). A product is returned by a customer maybe because it is defective, did  not work as advertised, in wrong size or perhaps because the customer suddenly changed  minds and decided that they did not need the thing after all (Blanchard, 2007). Proper after- sales service may help to enhance customer’s loyalty and at the same time might improve  firm’s  competitive  advantage. According  to  Gentry  (1999),  overall  customers  returns  are  estimated at 6% of sales and may run as high as 15% for mass merchandisers and up to 35%  for catalogue and e-commerce retailers. However, most of the business organizations are not  aware about the after-sales service factors and its impact towards the customer satisfaction.  Failing to realize the importance of the factors can lead to a disastrous and threatening business  relationship. Dissatisfied customers will turn to competitors who can offer better after-sales  services (Shaharudin, Yusof, Elias & Mansor, 2009).  Besides regulation and customer, other stakeholders and even competitors are expected to also  put more pressure on firms to improve the level of reverse logistics adoption as rivalry between  firms in the global market these days put more pressure on companies to reduce costs.  Getting  ahead  of  the  competitors  in  customer  service  will  definitely  improve  the  manufacturer’s  financial proficiency, through improves profits and higher recovery rates (Stock, 1992). Based  on the above issues, it is obvious that Malaysian manufacturers these days faced pressures to  implement reverse logistics adoption. Therefore, this study is conducted in order to determine  which pressure has the most influence on the level of reverse logistics adoption. In addition,  the other objective of this study is also to identify the current level of reverse logistics adoption  among Malaysian manufacturers and most importantly, to study whether reverse logistics  based on the manufacturers point of view has an influence on firm’s performance or not. 2.   REVERSE LOGISTICS ACTIVITIES Reverse  logistics  activities  offers  benefits  to  the  customers,  companies  and  even  the  environment. There are various business activities that are part of reverse logistics programme.  Each activities serve different purposes such as to remove defective and environmentally  hazardous products from the hands of customers and this practice subsequently leads to benefits  to the environment (Jayaraman, Patterson, & Rolland, 2003). At the same time, companies  can become more environmentally efficient through activities such as recycling, reusing, and  reducing the amount of materials used (Carter & Ellram, 1998; Aghazadeh, 2008). By reusing  the end-of-life products, the environment is benefited and the company’ goodwill among the  consumer might increase. Reverse logistics might also lead to production of green products  through recycling, remanufacturing or reconditioning that appeal the consumer, as present day  consumers are ready to pay more for green products (Vandermerwe & Oliff, 1990). Jayaraman  and Luo (2007) stresses that high quality reverse logistics activities can also promote long- term relationships where customers are more likely to repurchase from firms who do a good  job at handling returns. Table 1 describes some of the major the activities involved in reverse  logistics program. 154 Reverse Logistics: Pressure For Adoption And The Impact On Firm’s Performance Table 1: Reverse Logistics Activities and Its Description Activities Description Products for which a customer wants a refund because it either fails  to meet his needs, the standard, or fails to perform.

When a product is sold to a broker or some other low-revenue  customer (Outlet/discount store). A controlled environment for burying solid waste Reverse logistics activities offers benefits to both the customers, companies and even the  environment.  For  example,  reverse  logistics  activities  involve  the  removal  of  defective  and  environmentally  hazardous  products  from  the  hands  of  customers  and  this  practice  subsequently leads to benefits to the environment (Jayaraman, Patterson, & Rolland, 2003).  For companies that continually strive for achieving cost savings in their production processes,  reverse logistics program is a good option as it would lead to cost reduction (Fassoula, 2005;  Gentry, 1999; "Competitive advantage through," 2004). At the same time, companies can  become more environmentally efficient through recycling, reusing, and reducing the amount of  materials used (Carter & Ellram, 1998; Aghazadeh, 2008). By reusing the end-of-life products  the environment is benefited and the company’ goodwill among the consumer might increase.  Reverse logistics might also lead to production of green products that appeal the consumer  as present day consumers are ready to pay more for green products (Casadesus-Masanell et  al., 2009; Vandermerwe & Oliff, 1990). Jayaraman and Luo (2007) stresses that high quality  reverse logistics can also promote long-term relationships where customers are more likely to  repurchase from firms who do a good job at handling returns.   Nik Ab Halim Nik Abdullah and Sabariah Yaakub 155 3.   THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT Figure 1 presents the theoretical framework of the study. It is developed based on previous  study related to reverse logistics adoption. The model consists of four independent variables  namely financial and competitive pressure, customer/stakeholder pressure, regulatory pressure  and corporate citizenship pressure. These four proposed factors are expected to directly impact  the dependent variable, which is the level of reverse logistics adoption.   Figure 1: Theoretical Framework of the Study Financial &  competitive pressure Demanding  customer’s pressure Regulatory pressure Corporate  citizenship pressure Reverse Logistics  Adoption Level Firm’s  Performance 3.1.  Financial and Competitive Pressure In order to be competitive, firms these days need to innovate and discover the best competitive  opportunities and improve the quality of its products and methods in order to progress. At  the same time, firms who want to sustain their competitive advantage must earn the trust of  customers and this could be gained by having a good return policy. A good return policy needs  good reverse logistics programme. The reality is that a good reverse logistics programme  can be a differentiator and provides a means of gaining market and competitive advantage  (Jayaraman & Luo, 2007). Rivalry between firms in the global market these days put more  pressure  on  companies  to  reduce  costs.  Implementation  of  reverse  logistics  activities  can  help firms in becoming more proficient at handling returned goods. It will not only improve  relationships along the supply chain, but also reduces costs. Thus, this proficiency improves  profits and higher recovery rates are reached (Stock, 1992). Previous studies found out that  there is a tendency that the intensity with which firms compete with their competitors in the  market  positively  affects  their  strategic  business  policies,  such  as  it  influence  manager’s  investment decisions (Grenadier, 2002), or in their innovation effort (Aghion et al., 2005), or  in creating firm’s marketing strategy (Porter, 1979). Therefore, it is hypothesises that:    H1: Financial and competitive pressure is positively related to the level of reverse  logistics adoption. 156 Reverse Logistics: Pressure For Adoption And The Impact On Firm’s Performance 3.2.  Demanding customer/Stakeholders Pressure In  the  present  scenario  where  there  is  a  growing  concern  for  environmental  protection  among consumers and stakeholders such as the shareholders, government, non-governmental  Organisations (NGOs) or other pressure groups; firms are expected to be under enormous  pressure  to  implement  reverse  logistics.  Customers  even  are  ready  to  pay  more  for  environmental-friendly  products  (Casadesus-Masanell  et  al.,  2009; Vandermerwe  &  Oliff,  1990), so there are not many options left for companies but to go for reverse logistics practices.  This requires proper disposal of end-of-life products which otherwise have a negative impact  on the environment. This public concern for environment should not be taken as a problem,  but must be considered as opportunities for companies to gain more profit by marketing their  green products. Implementation of reverse logistics also requires a liberal return policy where  customers are often allowed to return products for any reason. This coupled with the need to  accommodate damaged or defective merchandise, product recalls, maintenance and repairs,  means logistics professionals must place a higher priority on effectively managing returns  (Autry, Daugherty, & Richey, 2001). Efficient after-sales services will definitely increase the  consumers’ satisfaction (Shaharudin et al., 2009). Based on the above argumentation, it is  hypothesises that: H2: Demanding customer/stakeholders pressure is positively related to the level of    reverse logistics adoption. 3.3.  Regulatory Pressure Sustainable development and environmental protection concerns are among the significant  issues faced by businesses these days. Introduction of new or improved regulations that relates  to product and waste disposal may make it mandatory for the companies to recover used  products produced by them or accept them back at the end of the useful life of the product.  Regulations are generally credited as having the greatest influence on a firm's reverse logistics  activities (Carter & Ellram, 1998) and therefore, companies are expected to focus on reverse  logistics  operations  because  of  environmental  reasons  (Rogers  &  Tibben-Lembke,  1998).  European Waste electrical and electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive introduced in January  2007 for example requires electrical and electronic manufacturers to comply with this scheme  in order to trade in Europe (Scott, 2008). The German packaging ordinance of 1991 resulted in  the companies working closely with their competitors to put tough environmental policies into  practice (Cairncross, 1992). Packaging therefore was returned mainly because it is reusable or  sometimes legal regulations required that it should be disposed of in a proper and acceptable  manner (Rogers & Tibben-Lembke, 2001). Previous studies reveal that most firms who are  practicing environmentally-friendly programs are doing so only because they are trying to  avoid violating environmental-related regulations (Luken & Van Rompaey, 2008; Hokey &  William 2001). As a result, the third hypothesis of this study is: H3:  Regulatory  pressure  is  positively  related  to  the  level  of  reverse  logistics    adoption.   Nik Ab Halim Nik Abdullah and Sabariah Yaakub 157 3.4.  Corporate Citizenship Pressure Firms these days are also under huge pressure to behave in a socially responsible manner, or  usually known as corporate citizenship pressure. Corporate citizenship is the extent to which  businesses are socially responsible for meeting legal, ethical and economic responsibilities  placed  on  them  by  shareholders. The  aim  is  for  businesses  to  create  higher  standards  of  living and quality of life in the communities in which they operate, while still preserving  profitability  for  stakeholders. As  demand  for  socially  responsible  corporations’  increases,  investors, consumers and employees are now more willing to use their individual power to  punish companies that do not share their values. For example, investors who find out about  a company's negative corporate citizenship practices could boycott its products or services,  refuse to invest in its stock or speak out against that company among family and friends  (Investopedia, 2012). Corporate citizenship is likely to be acknowledged by businesses as  a worthwhile investment if its activities clearly trigger consumers’ active support. Inasmuch  as corporate citizenship may be desirable for society as a whole, it is unlikely to be widely  embraced by organizations unless it yields concrete business benefits (Isabelle & Ferrell, 2001).  Implementation of reverse logistics activities is a way to portray good corporate citizenship.  Therefore, it is hypothesises that manufacturers will implement or increase the current level of  reverse logistics adoption due the corporate citizenship pressure. Thus, the fourth hypothesis  of this study is: H4:  Corporate citizenship pressure is positively related to the level of reverse     logistics adoption. 3.5.  Firm’s Performance In measuring the firm’s performance, it is essential to recognize the multidimensional nature of  the performance construct (Cameron, 1978; Chakravarthy, 1986). Previous research testing the  relationship between firm’s strategy and performance suggested that it should include multiple  performance measures. Such measures could include traditional accounting measures such as  sales growth, market share, and profitability. Other non-financial considerations may also be  used such as reputation, public image and goodwill, and the commitment and satisfaction of  customers (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Many benefits can be associated directly with effective reverse logistics management. These  include,  among  others,  improved  customer  satisfaction  and  reduction  in  inventory  and  warehousing cost. The benefits of effective reverse logistics management can also be considered  as some of the key performance measures of reverse logistics program and these could include  environmental  regulatory  compliance,  improved  customers  relations,  recovery  of  assets  (products), cost containment, improved profitability and reduced inventory investment (Autry,  et al., 2001). An effective reverse logistics system could potentially increase profitability via  reduced material requirements and an improved market share via an environmental image.  Indirect benefits of a reverse logistics programme such as better corporate image and increased  levels of customer satisfaction may also add value (Jayaraman & Luo, 2007). Based on these  arguments, the final hypothesis of this study is: H5:  The level of reverse logistics adoption has a positive impact on firm’s      performance.   158 Reverse Logistics: Pressure For Adoption And The Impact On Firm’s Performance 4.   METHODOLOGY This study is explanatory in nature as it tries to explain the causal relationship between four  factors (financial and competitive pressure, customer and stakeholder pressure, regulatory  pressure,  and  corporate  citizenship  pressure)  with  the  level  of  reverse  logistics  adoption  among manufacturers in Malaysia. It also tries to find out whether the level of reverse logistics  implementation has a significant effect on firm’s performance or not.  In order to achieve the  objective of the study, quantitative research approach was adopted where primary data were  collected using survey questionnaires. Survey questionnaire was developed based on measures  used in previous related studies to gain information on the level of pressure faced by the  manufacturers, the current level of reverse logistics adoption and the level of performance.  The population of this study consists of all manufacturing companies located at the three  northern state of Malaysia, which are Penang, Kedah and Perlis, together with companies  located in the Klang Valley, namely Kuala Lumpur and Selangor. Manufacturers were selected  as respondents of this study because manufacturing sector is a major contributor to Malaysian  economy. It accounts for 20.6% of Malaysia’s gross domestic product (GDP) and is expected  to be an important economic growth driver during the Tenth Malaysia Plan period which  takes 2011 to 2015. The sector is expected to grow at 5.7% annually until 2015, raising its  contribution to GDP to 26.3% by the end of the Plan period (Ministry of Finance Malaysia,  2012). The increase in manufacturing activities however brings a serious impact on Malaysian  environmental  quality.  The  Malaysia  Environmental  Quality  Report  (2011)  indicates  that  manufacturing industries and are among the major sources of water and air pollution in this  country. One possible solution in reducing the environmental pollution from manufacturing  activities is through reverse logistics and thereby justifies the selection of manufacturers as the  respondent for this study.  The  sampling  frame  used  for  this  study  is  the  Federation  of  Malaysian  Manufacturers  (FMM) Directory for the year 2010. Manual count of the directory shows that there are 1356  manufacturers located in the above mentioned states from various industries but most numbers  of manufacturers are from the electrical and electronics, automotive, chemicals and petroleum,  food and beverage, and also machinery and fabricated metal industry. Manufacturers from  various different industries were randomly selected to allow generalisation of the findings  towards every manufacturing sector in Malaysia. Based on the sample size table developed by  Cavana, Delahaye and Sekaran (2001), the number of sample needed for this study is 300. A  simple random sampling method was adopted in selecting the respondent. The survey questionnaire for this study have five different sections where the first section  looks at the company’s demographic information while second section obtain the reverse  logistics activities and the level of reverse logistics implementation at the company. Third  section consists of questions for all four independent variables of the study (reverse logistics  pressures). Both the independent and dependent variables of this study was measured using  five points Likert scale. Survey questionnaire was developed based on the instruments used  in previous studies related to reverse logistics, firm’s performance or other relevant topics.  Before the actual distribution of questionnaires, a pilot study was conducted to determine the  readers understanding of the items and to confirm the internal reliability.  It is pertinent in    Nik Ab Halim Nik Abdullah and Sabariah Yaakub 159 order to further improve the questionnaires and avoid any confusion on the part of respondents  before the actual questionnaire distribution took place. In addition, pilot study is relevant as  the feedback given by the respondents help improve the reliability of the research. First draft  of the questionnaire, which combined the previous measures used in related research was  pilot tested to confirm its internal reliability. A total of 30 companies were selected based on  convenience basis for this pilot study. Data from pilot study were analyzed using SPSS and  the reliability of each variable was checked using their Cronbach’s Alpha value. Table 3.8  shows the result of pilot study data analysis where all variables of the study have a Cronbach’s  Alpha value of more than 0.6, which is the cut-off value or the acceptable reliability level. It  also proofs that there is good internal consistency of the survey items in the scale. Several  questions were also identified by respondents as being vague and quite confusing. The pilot  study helped to identify this problem and thus been improved to ensure better understanding  of the questions asked. All the necessary changes and amendments to the questionnaire based  on the pilot study were conducted before the actual data collection activity was carried out. In total, 500 survey questionnaires were distributed either via self-administered, regular mail  or through email. Some questionnaires were also sent by faxes as per respondent’s request. For  mail survey, a mailed package that included a cover letter explaining the research objectives  and instructions on how to complete the questionnaire, together with a postage-paid reply  envelope, was sent to respondents in order to encourage the return of the questionnaire. All the  necessary action was taken to ensure that those who filled in the survey via self-administered  and through email were omitted from the mailing list. The questionnaire was sent to the key  informant within the companies, namely the officer in-charge of supply chain and logistics  operation or the top management of the company itself. A telephone follow up was made two  weeks after the questionnaire was posted to remind the respondents about the questionnaire.  Respondents were also promised anonymity for themselves and their company, in addition to  a guarantee of the confidentiality of data they provided. Table 2: Cronbach Alpha Value for Each Variable Variables Cronbach’s Alpha Financial/Competitors pressure  Customer and stakeholder pressure  Regulatory pressure  Corporate citizenship pressure  Reverse logistics level  Performance  0.689 0.719 0.866 0.848 0.817 0.849 Even with the above data collection efforts conducted to acquire more returned questionnaires,  only 104 of the 500 surveys distributed to selected companies were completed and returned,  which  makes  the  return  rate  20.8%.  Upon  preliminary  screening  of  all  the  returned  questionnaires, only 101 questionnaires are considered as usable for further data analysis. Three  questionnaires were rejected because of too many missing value. Data analysis was conducted  160 Reverse Logistics: Pressure For Adoption And The Impact On Firm’s Performance using two statistical softwares, which were SPSS for descriptive statistics and SmartPLS 2.0 in  order to test the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. The structural  equation modelling technique using the Partial Least Square (PLS) regression approach was  used to validate the measurement instrument and research model of this study because it  examine the causal relationship between pressures that influence the level of reverse logistics  adoption, followed by how the level of adoption impact firm’s performance. At the same time,  PLS also has the ability to model latent constructs under conditions of non-normality and small  to medium sample sizes as it places minimal restrictions on measurement scales and residual  distribution (Chin, Marcolin, & Newsted, 2003). PLS analysis involves two stages. The first  one is the assessment of reliability and validity of the measurement model established. The  objective is to make sure that the construct measures are valid and reliable before attempting  to draw the conclusions (Hulland, 1999; Barclay, Higgins, & Thompson, 1995). During this  stage, the convergent and discriminant validity of the research instrument was tested based on  indicator’s factor loading, and the average variance extracted (AVE) value. The second stage  is the assessment of the structural model itself and a bootstrap re-sampling procedure with  500 samples was used to calculate the significance of path coefficients in the research model.   The bootstrap approach treats the collected research sample as a population from which a  large number of samples are drawn with continuous replacement such that the probability of  selection for any given case remains equal over every random draw (Mallinckrodt, Abraham,  Wei & Russell, 2006). 5.   RESULTS  Descriptive analysis 5.1.  Preliminary analysis of the returned questionnaires shows that majority of the respondents  are from the electrical and electronics industry (64%), automotive industry (27%), food and  beverage (5%) and others (4%). Out of 101 manufacturers that return the survey questionnaires,  43 companies are fully owned by a foreign company or 42.6%, while 33 firms or 32.7% are a  local company with no foreign shares at all. Another 10 (9.9%) and 12 (11.9%) have foreign  ownership of 1 to 50% and 52 to 99% respectively. 31 companies have been in operation for  more than 25 years or 30.7%. Second is in between 6 to 10 years with 28 (27.7%) companies  and third is 16 to 20 years with 24 (23.8%) companies. Majority of respondents have more  than 301 employees, as a total of 64 manufacturers are in this category while 42 of them  employ more than 500 employees. 37 manufacturers in total have less than 300 employees  and 23 employs less than 100 people. In terms of annual turnover, more than half earn more  than RM20 million annually or over 62% of the respondents. Even 55 of them earned more  than RM40 million a year. Another 37 manufacturers earned less than RM20 million where 4  earned less than a million in revenue.  In order to measure the level of reverse logistics adoption, four measures were used, namely the  financial investment, resource allocation, management commitment and overall involvement  towards reverse logistics activities. Three out of these four indicators as depicted in table  2 scores a mean value of less than 3.0 (average), which is financial investment, resource  allocation and overall involvement. Only mean scores for management commitment is more  than the average, which is 3.12. Overall mean for reverse logistics level is 2.67.   Nik Ab Halim Nik Abdullah and Sabariah Yaakub 161 Table 3: Level of Reverse Logistics Adoption Financial investment in RL  Resources allocated for RL  Mgmt Commitment in RL  Overall involvement in RL  N 100  100  100  101  Mean 2.36  2.35  3.12  2.74  Std.

Measurement Model The  assessment  of  the  measurement  model  is  done  by  examining  the  content  validity,  convergent validity and discriminant validity. For content validity, all scales used in this study  were derived from previous studies related to reverse logistics and business performance. A  first draft of the questionnaire was discussed with a few lecturers before it was pilot tested  at 30 manufacturing companies. The Cronbach Alpha for each variable is above the cut-off  level 0f 0.6. Therefore, content validity is assumed to be fulfilled in this study. According  to  Fornell  and  Larcker  (1981),  convergent  validity  is  demonstrated  when  indicators  load  highly (loading> 0.50) on their associated factors. Table 4 shows the items loading for every  variables of the study. There are three items that have loading scores less than 0.5, which  are CorpCitz2, CustSH6 and Fincom1. These items therefore are removed and will not be  used in the assessment of the structural model analysis. Besides looking at items loading,  convergent validity is also consider as adequate when each constructs (variables) have an  Average Variance Extracted (AVE) score of at least 0.5 (Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Table 4  also shows that all constructs have an AVE value of more than 0.5 and therefore, it can be  concluded that the model has an adequate convergent validity.  Discriminant validity describes the degree to which the operationalisation is not similar to  other operationalisations that it theoretically should not be similar to. Campbell and Fiske  (1959) introduced the concept of discriminant validity within their discussion on evaluating  test validity. A successful evaluation of discriminant validity shows that a test of a concept is  not highly correlated with other tests designed to measure theoretically different concepts. The  AVE statistics are then again used to determine the discriminant validity of the model. The  square root of the average variance extracted (AVE) statistics were calculated using Microsoft  Excel and compared with the correlations among the latent variables using the latent variable  correlation matrix output of PLS (Chin, et al., 2003). The latent variable correlation matrix  and the square root of the AVE are indicated in Table 5.Correlations between constructs is  displayed in the lower left off-diagonal elements in the matrix.  Average variance shared between the construct and its measures should be greater than the  variance shared between the construct and other constructs in the model (Fornell & Larcker,  1981). Table 5 shows that the diagonal elements in bold (square root of AVE) are greater  than the off-diagonal elements at both corresponding rows and columns. For example, the  square root of AVE for CorpCitz (0.778) is higher than the correlation of CustomerSH and  CorpCitz (0.196). It is also higher than corporate citizenship’s correlation with other constructs  162 Reverse Logistics: Pressure For Adoption And The Impact On Firm’s Performance (FinCom = 0.343, performance = 0.154, RL_Level = 0.121, RegPres = 0.331). Therefore, it  can be concluded that the findings of the PLS measurement model analysis show evidence of  discriminant validity, where all constructs are statistically discriminated from the others. 5.3.  Structural Model The second step after the assessment of the measurement model is the assessment of the  structural model itself by looking at the sign and magnitude of path coefficients. It is then  followed by the test of whether the paths are statistically significant. The bootstrap procedure  with 500 re-samples as recommended by Chin, Marcolin and Newsted (2003) was used to  calculate  the  significance  of  the  path  coefficients  (t-value).  The  bootstrapping  procedure  generates random samples of observations from the original data set by using a sampling  through replacement technique. The path coefficients were then re-estimated using each one of  these random samples of observations. Previous studies using PLS have typically considered  path coefficient of above 0.20 as having a strong relationship, path coefficients of between 0.10  to 0.20 as moderate, and path coefficients below 0.10 as weak (Johnson, 1997). Meanwhile, the  degree to which the PLS model accomplishes its objectives of minimising errors or to maximise  the variance explained, can be determined by examining the R2 values (Lertwongsatien, 2000).   R2 is a measure of the proportion of the total of the dependent variables, which is explained by  independent variables. Falk (2005)suggests that the R2 value should be more than 0.1, as any  value lower than that informs very little even though it is statistically significant. The entire  specified path and their coefficient, together with the R2 value is shown in figure 2.

The T-distribution table were referred in order to obtain the P value (Degree of freedom,  df = 100). The result shows that out of 5 relationships tested, only 2 shows a significant  relationship, which are between customer and stakeholder pressure (CustomerSH) with the  level of reverse logistics adoption (RL_Level) and between corporate citizenship (CorpCitz)  and the level of reverse logistics adoption (RL_Level). Even the relationship between the level  of reverse logistics adoption and firm’s performance did not show a significant relationship.  Path coefficient for regulatory pressure is 0.23, indicating a strong relationship with level  of  reverse  logistics  adoption  while  Customer/stakeholder  pressure  only  have  a  moderate  relationship with adoption, which is 0.15.The variance explained values (R2) for level of reverse  logistics adoption is 0.132. It means that the model explains 13.2% of the variance in the level  of reverse logistics adoption among manufacturers in Malaysia. For performance, the variance  explained values is only 0.037 or 3.7%. This is very low and it justify why the bootstrap  analysis before shows that the relationship between level of reverse logistics adoption and  firm’s performance is not significant.

DISCUSSIONSAND CONCLUSIONS The  first  objective  of  this  study  were  to  empirically  study  the  level  of  reverse  logistics  adoption  and  the  impact  of  financial  and  competitive  pressure,  customer  and  stakeholder  pressure, regulatory pressure and corporate citizenship pressure on reverse logistics adoption    Nik Ab Halim Nik Abdullah and Sabariah Yaakub 165 level among manufacturing firms in Malaysia. Another objective is to study the manager’s  perception on whether reverse logistics have influence on firm’s performance or not. The  analysis of data has led to some major findings. First, the level of reverse logistics adoption  among Malaysian manufacturers is considerably low with a mean score of 2.67. An item by  item analysis shows that the level of investment, resources and overall commitment towards  reverse logistics are less than average. It shows that firms are not really ready to commit  themselves towards investing and allocating extra resources for reverse logistics adoption.  Even the score for commitment by the management shows just a slightly higher than average  score. It seems that manufacturers are not ready to invest and allocate resources even though  the management of the company is aware of the benefit of adopting reverse logistics.  Second, only two out of four studied variables have a significant relationship with reverse  logistics adoption level, namely regulatory pressure and, customer and stakeholder pressure.  It is interesting to note that the reverse logistics adoption based on this study is affected  strongly by rules and regulation, while demanding customer and stakeholder have a moderate  influence. The results demonstrated that the government, consumer and pressure groups such  as NGOs have a strong influence on firm’s decision and their voice would lead to an increase in  the likelihood of adopting reverse logistics or increasing the current level of reverse logistics  activities among manufacturing firms in Malaysia. Financial and competitive pressure and  corporate  citizenship  pressure  have  no  significant  impact  on  reverse  logistics  adoption.  Financial and competitive pressure might not have a significant effect as firm’s competitors  might also do not heavily involve in reverse logistics activities. Therefore, there is no urgency  for the respondent’s to increase their involvement in reverse logistics activities.  Corporate citizenship meanwhile is important to manufacturers that produce consumer goods  such as food and beverages, cosmetics, cars, but not for producers of industrial product, materials  or components. Possibly, most respondents of this study did not manufactured consumer goods  and that is why corporate citizenship does not significantly pressure firms to increase the level  of their reverse logistics activities. Some authors do argue that reverse logistics performance  could be poor due to the fact that more than one company may get involved in the reverse  logistics process, and thus a holistic approach is required. Another reason behind this is that  reverse logistics is still in its infancy and manufacturing organizations have not assumed a pro- active role to consider reverse logistics activities in the design phase (Carter & Ellram, 1998).  Additionally, an efficient reverse logistics system is much more valuable to a company selling  high-volume, high value product with a short life-cycle than to a retailer selling low-value  products (Jayaraman & Luo, 2007). Third, the results also indirectly indicate that the level of environmental awareness among  consumers and stakeholders in Malaysia have improve significantly, that it influences firms  decision in adopting the environmental friendly logistics practices such as reverse logistics.  This is evidence when one of the item in the survey questionnaire which is “Our customer and  shareholder are concern about environmental protection and sustainable development” scores  a mean of 4.07. It shows that managers involved in this study are generally agreed to the fact  that the environmental awareness among the customer and stakeholder these days has increase.  This phenomenon also put managers under a greater pressure to undertake reverse logistics  not only as a consequence of their ethical principles but also because they feel that it is a good  166 Reverse Logistics: Pressure For Adoption And The Impact On Firm’s Performance way of satisfying their customers and stakeholders. Finally, this study examines the impact of  reverse logistics adoption level on firms’ performance, as perceived by the respondents. The  output of data analysis stage shows that there is no significant relationship between the level  of reverse logistics adoption and performance. This finding indicates that reverse logistics  programs according to the managers of manufacturing firms in Malaysia did not contributes  towards the improvement in firm’s performance. Even the whole model of this study according  to the PLS analysis explains only 3.7% of the variance in firms’ performance, which is very  low. It means that there are many other factors that determine the level of performance in the  opinion of Malaysian manufacturers besides the adoption of reverse logistics.  The possible explanation for this finding may be related back to the previous discussions  where regulatory pressure, together with consumer and stakeholder pressure have a significant  influence on reverse logistics adoption level. The fact that reverse logistics adoption level have  no influence on performance is observed possibly because there is lack of ‘true’ commitment  by these manufacturers in implementing reverse logistics. They implement it not as part of  their business strategy in order to improve the level of customer service, to improve quality,  to increase their revenue, to provide environmental protection or to reduce costs but merely  in response to the external pressures. Furthermore, just like many other logistics and supply  chain strategy such as information technology adoption or any other management technique  implementation, performance outcomes related to reverse logistics programs may remain sub- par without appropriate resource commitment (Skinner, Bryant, & Richey, 2008). Reverse  logistics activities such as recycling, refurbishing, remanufacturing and repackaging require  a significant resources commitment if the company want to reclaim the value from product  returns. The level of resources allocated for reverse logistics activities by these manufacturers  are also less than average, where the mean score for this item as shown in table 2 before, is only  2.35. Therefore, it is assumed to be among the reason why reverse logistics according to this  study did not contribute much towards the performance of the company. Although previously  highlighted literatures do state that reverse logistics helps improve firm’s performance, there is  also a similar study that shows disagree with result and similar to this study. A survey conducted  by Eyefortransport (2012) for example reveals that high-tech manufacturing companies were  split between seeing their reverse logistics as just cost centers to support product sales and  as competitive differentiators. Only about 5% out of 200 companies involved in the study  were able to apply these services in their profit centers, suggesting that only some high-tech  manufacturing companies are able to generate revenue through reverse logistics. This finding  indicates that majority of the respondents did not see reverse logistics as a source of revenue  that consequently will improve firm’s performance. 7.   CONTRIBUTIONS, LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH There are a number of significant contributions of this study to both the academia and business  practitioners.  Reverse  logistics  despite  all  the  practical  uses  by  many  manufacturers  in  developed countries are still not a popular practice among Malaysian manufacturers. The main  factors that results in adoption of reverse logistics and barriers that create this low adoption  level are seldom explored within the available literature. Therefore, the results of this study  fulfil this gap in the literature by answering the research questions of which factors increase the  level of adoption and which barriers contributes to totally non or minimum level of adoption of    Nik Ab Halim Nik Abdullah and Sabariah Yaakub 167 reverse logistics activities only. Regulatory pressure, together with customer and stakeholder  pressure are found to have a significant relationship with the level of reverse logistics adoption.  Issues such as lack of awareness and knowledge of reverse logistics, implementation cost  is high, lack of resources and no management commitment is among the top barriers that  inhibit an effective reverse logistics activities implementation among the manufacturers. At  the same time, this study also contributes to the literature by providing some insights on the  impact of reverse logistics adoption on firm’s performance. Even though the finding is not as  hypothesized, it shed lights on Malaysian manufacturers view on the factors that determine  their business performance. The fact that reverse logistics is not considered as a contributors  towards firm’s performance means that Malaysian manufacturers are still behind if compared  to manufacturers in developed countries who treats reverse logistics as anew source of core  competency. According  to  Rogers,  Lembke  and  Benardino  (2013),  managers  should  now  broadened their perspective as the difference between a product’s success (and profitability)  and failure in today’s competitive environment depends on how the end of life is managed.  Finally, this study contributes to the literature on reverse logistics adoption specifically within  the context of developing countries like Malaysia. Most studies on reverse logistics adoption to  date have been conducted in developed countries such as the United States, United Kingdom,  Australia and Europe.  For the practitioners, findings of this study could provide the management of a company  especially a manufacturer with a better understanding on reverse logistics adoption, especially  the factors that influence the adoption. Those who never know on the activities related to reverse  logistics will have a better understanding about the concept. Manufacturing firms in particular,  would be able to address their main concerns by looking at the findings of this study before  they decide to proceed with the adoption of reverse logistics programmes.  Findings and the  discussions of this study could also serve as a guide for business managers or policy makers in  Malaysia when creating policies related to reverse logistics, sustainable development or even  environmental protection. This study clearly shows that strict regulation and strong pressure  from customer and the stakeholders can increase the environmental awareness of managers  and the tendency to implement reverse logistics among the manufacturers. This study also  found out that managers involved did not view reverse logistics as a mean to improve their  business performance, as there is no significant relationship evidence. Product returns and  reverse logistics activities always been viewed as a cost centre by manufacturers and not as a  source of competitive advantage. Therefore, less attention and resource allocation is given on  reverse logistics activities. In contrast, manufacturers in developed countries as discussed in  the literature review before have already reap the advantage of implementing reverse logistics  such as reduction in logistics costs, increase profit, better environmental regulation compliance  and improve in goodwill. Therefore, more efforts should be taken by the relevant government  agencies, training centres and educational institutions to enlighten Malaysian manufacturing  firm’s managers on the potential of adopting comprehensive reverse logistics activities. There are a few issues that arise from this study which could provide an opportunity for further  research. First, data collected for this study is small due to cost and time constraint. The sample  size of this survey is only 101 manufacturers. Another research with a greater sample size to  replicate this survey using a different sample of companies in the other sectors such as service  168 Reverse Logistics: Pressure For Adoption And The Impact On Firm’s Performance sector may be conducted to validate these findings. Moreover, this study did not categorized  the sample based on their level of adoption such as high reverse logistics adoption level, low  level adopters and also non-adopters to refine and test the model. This will probably contributes  to the variation of reverse logistics adoption in various industries. Finally, this study includes  all manufacturing industries from all sizes and industry. The replication of the study where the  analysis is conducted based on specific industry or sizes of the company would provide new  insights into the reverse logistics adoption factors. It would also be interesting to replicate the  study for the analysis of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as the influential factors could  be different from big enterprises and multinational companies.
