China; bDepartment of Business Management, School of Management South China University of Technology, China This study examines the differential impact of an alignment of organizational culture and business strategy through which inducement-HR and involvement-HR systems may affect ﬁrm performance. It contributes to the strategic ﬁt of the HRM literature by using empirical data from 451 ﬁrms in southern China to evaluate the linkages among organizational culture, HR systems, business strategies and organizational perform- ance. The results show some support for an HR-organizational culture ﬁt and an HR-business strategy ﬁt, and have important managerial implications for matching the organizational culture and business strategy with an organization’s choice of HR systems to achieve maximum impact on organizational performance. Keywords: China; business; culture; HR practices; organizational culture; organizations; strategic ﬁt; strategy Introduction Employee involvement plays an important role in the success of high performance initiatives. Involvement-HR practices have been extensively researched in recent studies (Guthrie 2001; Gollan 2005). Involvement-HR is designed to foster high levels of autonomy, discretion, challenge and motivation, so that employees can make a meaningful and creative contribution. Participation and empowerment is greatly encouraged. Employee involvement and sharing of information is relatively weak in Chinese organizations. High power distance societies place less value on subordinate input and participation. Chinese employees are not accustomed to active involvement and participation. Employees are reluctant to accept responsibility and unlikely to exercise their initiative to get things done (Chow, Huang and Liu 2008). Typical paternalistic employers demonstrate their care and concern for their employees, but expect unquestioning obedience in return (Westwood and Chan 1992). The inducement-HR system is grounded on the nature of the employer – employee exchange. Based on the inducement-contribution model of employment, with high level of inducements offered by the employers, employees may feel obliged to reciprocate through working harder and are less likely to quit (Tsui and Wu 2005). Inducement-HR systems built around pay as an incentive work very well for Chinese ﬁrms. From involvement to inducement, it will be interesting to ﬁnd out which type of HR systems will be more appropriate for managing China’s massive labour force and what types of HR systems may contribute to better performance.

Despite growing research interest in the important ﬁeld of strategic human resource management (SHRM), our understanding of the relationship between HR, culture ﬁt and business strategy is still very limited. For instance, under what conditions and to what extent do HR systems matter? What relationship exists among strategy, culture and HR practices and how do they combine to strengthen an organization’s competitive advantage? In this study, we attempt to answer these questions by including organizational culture and business strategy. The focus of the study is on cultural alignment and business strategy alignment. Drawing on the SHRM, organizational culture and strategy theories, this study is designed to integrate and contribute to the strategic ﬁt of the HRM literature by using empirical data to evaluate the linkages among organizational culture, HR systems, business strategies, and organizational performance. It also examines the interaction effects of HR-culture and HR-strategy on ﬁrm performance. It is important to examine the extent to which organizational culture and business strategy match an organization’s choice of HR systems to achieve maximum impact on organizational performance. We test the model in culture-HR linkage and business strategy-HR linkage using responses from 451 ﬁrms in southern China. is experiencing revolutionary change. Three decades of economic reform have made China an attractive market for multinational companies (MNCs) (see Warner 2008). China is becoming increasingly integrated into the global economy, and this integration was recently symbolized by its admission to the World Trade Organization. As China’s economy continues to develop, the country’s business environment In an increasingly competitive environment, the pressure for change has placed new demands on human resource practices. China’s emergence as a major player in the global economy provides a very challenging research site for studying the HR systems. Results from the present study offer some important implications for both research and practice. Its theoretical and empirical ﬁndings will contribute to the development of global HRM knowledge and theories, and complement the existing literature on HRM research. The empirical results offer some evidence on the importance of the relationship among HR practices, interaction effects of organizational culture, business strategy and ﬁrm performance in the world’s largest emerging market. The study’s ﬁndings are also of practical relevance not only for local Chinese ﬁrms but also for MNCs investing in China. The ﬁndings provide important insights for multinational business executives wishing to design effective HRM systems and to align them with organizational culture and business strategy to attain high performance in China. The following section starts with a brief review of previous studies of the relationship between HR systems and organizational culture as well as HR and business strategy. Based on the literature review, hypotheses are developed and tested with empirical data collected for this study. The study concludes with a discussion of the managerial implications and suggests directions for future research. Theoretical framework Cabrera and Bonache (1999) asserted the need for the alignment of organizational culture and business strategy by integrating knowledge from SHRM with the design of HR practices. The authors stressed that an organization should improve its competitive position through careful planning of the HR practices necessary for achieving its business strategy. HR systems shape the behavior of employees, thus becoming the means whereby 2294 I.H.S. Chow and S.S. Liu factor cultures are created and sustained (Schwartz and Davis 1981). A strong culture may be an important in obtaining a competitive advantage, but only under certain circumstances, i.e. if the culture is appropriate. Strong positive associations are found between organizational cultural values of respect for people, innovation, stability and aggressiveness, and employee responses of organizational commitment, job satisfaction, propensity to remain with the organization, and information sharing behavior (McKinnon, Harrison, Chow and Wu 2003). The creation of norms to support an organization’s business strategy depends on the careful design of the organization’s HR practices. It is proposed that organizational culture, business strategy and human resource strategy each have a differential impact on ﬁrm performance. Figure 1 illustrates the theoretical framework we propose for the present study. The importance of HR alignment as a basis of competitive advantage has repeatedly been stressed in previous studies (Cabrera and Bonache 1999; Vandenberg, Richardson and Eastman 1999; Barrette and Ouellette 2000). In high performing organizations, HRM is treated as a set of complementary practices aligned with the ﬁrm’s goals and strategies (Becker and Huselid 1998). Sustainable HRM systems are those which are internally coherent, consistent with the ﬁrm’s business strategy, and consistent with the broader context in which the ﬁrm is operating (Gollan 2005). The underlying logic is the assumption that congruence or ﬁt would result in organizational effectiveness (Delery 1998). Organizational alignment theory (Selmer 1997) and contingency theory (Schuler and Jackson 1987; Delery and Doty 1996) posit that HRM should match the demands of internal and external conditions in expecting organizational effectiveness. External ﬁt links HR systems to business strategy whereas internal ﬁt focuses on complementarities across HRM activities (Huselid, Jackson and Schuler 1997). The basic premise is that ﬁrm performance can be enhanced to the degree that there is internal consistency among HR practices and compatibility of HR practices with a ﬁrm’s strategy (Youndt, Snell, Dean and Lepak 1996; Wright and Snell 1998). Therefore integrating the HR system with a ﬁrm’s business strategy is conducive to the enhancement of organizational effectiveness, particularly for a high commitment work system. Figure 1. The conceptual framework. The International Journal of Human Resource Management 2295 HR systems and performance The strategic perspective of HRM and the systems approach of designing HR practices are the two most dominant research approaches on HRM-ﬁrm performance linkage (Bowen and Ostroff 2004). SHRM research focuses on evaluating the congruence among business strategies, HRM policies and organizational effectiveness (Dyer and Holder 1988; Wright, McMahan and McWilliams 1994). The value of HRM and its impact on organizational effectiveness may be magniﬁed when the HRM practices of an organization support the ﬁrm’s ability to establish and maintain a match in internal and external demands. The philosophy of SHRM emphasizes the need to achieve coordination and integration between organizational culture, HR systems, business strategy, and corporate goals (Schuler 1992). The systems approach views HR practices as internally coherent, consistent with the ﬁrm’s corporate strategy. It is the system of HR practices that inﬂuences a ﬁrm’s performance. Dyer and Holder’s (1988) typology classiﬁed HR systems into investment, involvement and inducement, each ﬁtting a particular business strategy and corporate culture. An empirical study by Swiercz (1995) conﬁrmed the validity of the inducement and involvement systems but failed to support the notion of investment-HR. The present study investigates only the two validated HR systems, i.e., inducement and involvement. Inducement-HR puts a strong focus on containing cost. It maintains efﬁciency by narrowly deﬁning jobs, and builds a strong link between each worker’s effort and his pay. Inducement-HR builds around incentives, using performance-based pay as an attempt to monitor and control employee performance. It has been amply demonstrated that incentives raise productivity and proﬁtability and decrease the mobility of workers (Beer and Katz 2003). The introduction of performance-related pay schemes has substantially improved ﬁrm performance. Inducement plans need continuous management support and monitoring. Performance-related pay cannot be directly linked to an increase in participation of employees in decision-making in Finland (Piekkola 2005). High involvement HR systems, based on industrial democracy and self-management work teams, require more autonomy, greater task variety, and more effective use of knowledge and skill (Jones and Wright 1992). Involvement-HR builds around a relatively high proportion of professionals by structuring jobs to provide maximum challenge, participation and autonomy. A growing body of literature has documented the contingency relationship between HR systems and ﬁrm performance (Delery and Doty 1996). The SHRM literature consistently shows that involvement HR practices are associated with positive performance outcomes and higher ﬁnancial success (Lawler, Mohrman and Ledford 1995; Bae and Lawler 2000; Yu and Egri 2005). Levering and Moskowitz (1993) surveyed the 100 best companies to work for in the United States, and Lawler et al.’s (1995) survey on Fortune 1000 companies found that companies that made use of employee involvement and TQM practices reported signiﬁcantly higher ﬁnancial success. Empirical results from Singapore, Taiwan and Korea support the notion that high commitment/involvement work systems or practices have a positive effect on organizational performance (Bae and Lawler 2000; Huang 2000; Khatri 2000). Arthur (1994) and Huselid (1995) found human resources to be signiﬁcantly related to employee turnover rates. In this study we synthesize the fruits of these previous studies, and propose that both inducement-HR and involvement-HR systems enhance organizational effectiveness, their differential impact depending on their congruence with the organization’s strategy and culture. 2296 I.H.S. Chow and S.S. Liu Hypothesis 1: Both inducement-HR and involvement-HR systems are positively associated with performance outcomes and negatively associated with turnover rate. The effect will be stronger for involvement-HR systems. HR and organizational culture alignment Organizational culture is one of the most important factors of the internal organizational environment, and has a great bearing on SHRM (Yeung, Brockbank and Ulrich 1991; Cabrera and Bonache 1999). Organizational culture refers to the symbols, rituals, social patterns and shared understanding that govern behavior in the organization. These beliefs, values, and norms determine how things are done and deﬁne expected standards of behavior from every individual (Ulrich 1984; Deal and Kennedy 1992). According to Peters and Waterman (1981), strong cultural norms make an organization more efﬁcient. Wallach (1983) identiﬁed three distinct organizational cultures: bureaucratic; supportive; and innovative. Bureaucratic cultures are power oriented, regulated, procedural and hierarchical. The work is organized and systematic. It is suitable for well-trained staff but not likely to attract and retain creative and ambitious people. A bureaucratic culture is not the most conducive to the creation of employee commitment (Odom, Boxx and Dunn 1990). Supportive cultures are trusting, encouraging, relationship- oriented and collaborative. They provide an open, harmonious and warm place to work. People are friendly and helpful. Employees working in a supportive environment are more satisﬁed and have a greater degree of organizational commitment (Silverthorne 2004). A supportive culture works very well with the paternalistic style and the explicitly instrumental nature of inducement-HR systems. An innovative culture is exciting and dynamic. It provides a creative place to work, and is ﬁlled with challenge and risk. Innovative cultures encourage competition and develop an entrepreneurial environment. China is now moving away from a planned economy to a more competitive market-based system, and its organizational culture is becoming more competitive. In a dynamic, fast-changing market environment, China’s ﬁrms need a more proactive HR system to compete successfully with their overseas counterparts. The effect is stronger and more relevant for matching competitive culture with HR than innovative culture in the contemporary Chinese context. This is particularly true for involvement-HR when participation and ﬂexibility are badly needed in a highly competitive market. Organizational cultures not only facilitate ﬁrm performance, but also strengthen the impact of HR systems on ﬁrm performance. Companies whose organizational culture complements their HR systems will perform better. Child (1981) asserts that culture has a moderating effect on organizations, and notes that culturally-driven preferences inﬂuence the exercise of choice between alternative practices (p. 318). Managers implement HR systems based on their assumption and beliefs on the nature of the task and the employees (Aycan 2005). An empirical study by Silverthorne (2004) found that a supportive organizational culture appeared to work better in Taiwan than other types of cultures. A culture that is basically supportive in nature is likely to have the highest level of employee job satisfaction and organizational commitment, whereas a bureaucratic organizational culture resulted in the lowest levels of job satisfaction and organizational commitment. The same results also apply to lower turnover rate. The HR – culture ﬁt is expected to inﬂuence organizational outcomes. We propose that organizational cultures interact with HR systems in inﬂuencing ﬁrm performance and turnover. The International Journal of Human Resource Management 2297 Hypothesis 2a: A bureaucratic culture combining both inducement- and involvement- HR shows no signiﬁcant relationship to performance and turnover. Hypothesis 2b: Hypothesis 2c: A supportive culture combined with inducement-HR is signiﬁcantly and positively related to performance outcome and negatively associated with turnover. A competitive culture coupled with involvement-HR has a signiﬁcant positive relationship with performance outcomes but is negatively associated with turnover. HR and business strategy alignment Strategic choice theory posits that organizations proactively choose the HRM systems that best match their strategy (Kochan, McKersie and Cappelli 1984). The strategic perspective of HRM examines the ﬁt between various HRM practices and the company’s business strategies (Delery 1998). Previous studies have focused on the linkage between generic business strategy and HRM types (Schuler 1989; Bird and Beechler 1995). Arthur (1992) found that cost advantage strategy was strongly related to cost-reduction HRM, and differentiation was associated with the commitment-maximization HRM system. These studies show that business strategy is a critical factor in the choice of HRM system. The strategic ﬁt of HR and business strategy has also been investigated (Schuler and Jackson 1987; Gunnigle and Moore 1994). In their empirical study, Schuler and Jackson (1987) analyzed the contingent role of a business strategy and tried to link competitive strategy to HR systems. Innovative strategies focus on offering something new and different. The appropriate HR practices for innovative strategies include selecting highly-skilled, creative individuals, granting more discretion with minimal control, long- term focus and greater commitment. Thus, innovation strategy is positively associated with involvement-HR. A quality-enhancing strategy must adapt to changes and continuously upgrade product or service quality. HR practices for a quality-enhancing strategy include high levels of participation, feedback and cooperative teamwork. It is expected that a quality-enhancing strategy is positively associated with both inducement- HR and involvement-HR. A cost reduction strategy focuses on controlling expenses and achieving economies of scale. The corresponding HR practices for a cost reduction strategy maximize efﬁciency by using narrowly-designed jobs, close monitoring and a minimal level of training and development. HR can proactively add strategic value by enhancing the capability of the ﬁrm. This can be evidenced in providing innovative products and services, reducing costs, and improving quality. HR systems are effective only when they are appropriately integrated with a speciﬁc business strategy. Lepak and Snell (1999) examined the interaction of business strategy and HRM. This interaction is complementary in that the value of one element is increased by the present of other elements (Holmstrom and Milgrom 1994, p. 973). Based on Dyer and Holder’s (1988) assertion, ﬁrms are likely to use inducement-HR to compete largely on price and quality, while involvement-HR relies on an innovation strategy to provide continually differentiated products and services. The HR-strategy ﬁt is expected to inﬂuence organizational performance. Thus, we propose that business strategies moderate the relationship between HR systems and performance outcome. Hypothesis 3a: Firms pursuing a quality strategy with both inducement-HR and involvement-HR systems will be positively associated with perform- ance outcome and negatively with staff turnover. 2298 I.H.S. Chow and S.S. Liu Hypothesis 3b: Firms pursuing an innovation strategy with involvement-HR will be positively associated with performance outcome and negatively with staff turnover. Research method Both qualitative and quantitative methods are used. The survey data were supplemented with interviews. The interviews provided a deeper understanding of the HR practices in individual ﬁrms and also acted as a check on the inferences drawn from the survey. The interviews averaged 1 hour in length. A total of 48 interviews were conducted with HR experts and managers from Guangzhou, China, to identify a broad range of HR practices in the Chinese context. Although HR measure scales are available from the literature, different studies have used different measures of HR practices and there is no unique set of ‘best’ HR practices. We therefore developed our own measure instead of translating from the existing scale. Based on the opinion of expert interviews together with an extensive review from the current literature, a list of HR practices was generated for the present study. These HR practices are shown in Table 1. Each item was assessed by a 5-anchored Likert scale, with 1 being the highest and 5 being the lowest. The questionnaire was constructed in Chinese. These items were pre-tested with a sample of 110 practicing managers to verify their usefulness. Questionnaires were sent to the company’s HR Department by e-mail, and follow-up calls were made in late 2005. From the 600 questionnaires distributed, 451 responses were received, yielding a response rate of 75.2%. The average length of establishment of the companies surveyed was 10 years, and the length of operation ranged from 1 to 56 years. As far as ownership was concerned, 31.5% were state-owned or collectively-owned, 53.9% were Hong Kong and Taiwan ﬁrms in China, and the rest were foreign-invested Table 1.

The industries covered in the survey included manufacturing (47%), technology and electronic (29.3%), and a variety of other service industries such as utilities, ﬁnancial/insurance and property. The average number of employees per ﬁrm was 1,265. The ratio of managerial to operating staff was 11.87%. On average, a company’s HR department had 10.2 persons. Staff turnover rate for employees was 15%. Measures HR practices were assessed by 15 items, which focused on the HR practices such as career development path, performance standard, salary level, performance-based pay, employ- ment security, and information sharing. These items were factor analyzed to form two different HRM systems. The results are shown in Table 1. Consistent with the ﬁndings of previous studies, the ﬁrst factor was concerned with pay as incentives or inducement-HR. The second factor focused on how participation, sharing and exchange ﬁtted well with the involvement-HR system. The results from empirical classiﬁcation essentially correspond to the theoretical prediction of inducement and involvement HR systems. It is worth noting that a lower score on this measure indicates relatively intensive use of these HR practices. These two factors accounted for 48.11% of total variance explained. The alpha coefﬁcients were .81 for both inducement and involvement-HR types. Organizational culture was measured by 18 items using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). These items were factor analyzed to form Table 2.

The alpha coefﬁcients for the bureaucratic, supportive and competitive culture were .82, .82, and .89 respectively. Business strategies included cost reduction, innovation and quality enhancement. Following Schuler and Jackson (1987) and Huang (2001), 10 items were adopted in the present study. Questionnaire items adopted from existing Western studies were translated into Chinese and back translated by bilingual research teams to ensure equivalence of meaning of each item. Respondents were asked to rate each item on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). These items were factor analyzed using principal factor with varimax rotation method, resulting in three factors. All three factors accounted for 59.02% of the total variance explained (see Table 3). The alpha coefﬁcients for cost, quality and innovation were .58, .75 and .81 respectively. The alpha coefﬁcient for the cost-based business strategy seemed low so it was dropped for further analysis. (Note: Prior research evidence showed that low cost was not a very good strategy for Chinese ﬁrms (Brouthers and Xu 2002). Emphasis on cost control may prevent ﬁrms from spending on new product development, technological improvement and quality control, which in turn may affect ﬁrm performance. Low cost strategy seems not to play a relevant role.) Organizational effectiveness is a multidimensional construct (Dyer and Reeves 1995). Two ﬁrm level performance measures – employee turnover and overall performance outcomes, were used in the present study. Because not all surveyed organizations are publicly-listed companies, objective ﬁnancial data are sensitive and not available. Table 3. Factor structure of culture.

Managers are likely to provide the best estimate of ﬁrm performance. Overall performance is a composite measure of productivity, quality of products or services, research and development capability and market shares. These items were measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very low) to 5 (very high). Factor analysis resulted in one single factor accounting for 53.15% of the variance explained, with an alpha coefﬁcient of 0.76. Staff turnover is assessed with the annual rate of turnover. Control variables Firm characteristics, such as size and number of years of operation are determinants of ﬁrm performance. Larger organizations are more likely to use better- developed or more sophisticated HR practices. Since ﬁrms with superior resources will be able to formulate and implement unique and innovative strategies, ﬁrm size and years of operation are controlled for the prediction of organizational performance. Firm size was measured by the number of logarithmic transformation to normalize the distributions and make the measure more consistent with the previous studies. full-time employees. We used natural Results The descriptive statistics and correlations among variables are shown in Table 4. Overall outcome was signiﬁcantly correlated with all HR variables, cultural variables and business strategy variables. Turnover rate was negatively correlated with cultures, business strategies and outcome variables, but had no signiﬁcant correlation with HR variables. A low score in HR strategy indicates intensive use of these HR practices. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to examine the relative effects of HR practices, organizational culture, and business strategy on performance outcomes. Regression results are given in Table 5. As hypothesized, both inducement and involvement-HR showed signiﬁcant effects on performance outcomes. The strong impact of inducement-HR and involvement-HR was reﬂected in both the ß coefﬁcients and DR2. The results are not fully consistent with hypothesis 1. While both inducement-HR and involvement-HR showed a direct and signiﬁcant effect on performance outcome, they had no signiﬁcant effect on reducing turnover. HR systems affect through organizational culture and business strategy. Organizational culture as a whole contributed signiﬁcantly to ﬁrm performance, as indicated by the signiﬁcant changes in R2. The ß coefﬁcient of competitive culture was highly signiﬁcant, while bureaucratic and supportive cultures showed no signiﬁcance. Again, business strategy as a whole contributed signiﬁcantly to ﬁrm performance, as indicated by a signiﬁcant change in R2. The ß coefﬁcients of quality enhancing and innovation strategy were highly signiﬁcant. We explored the interaction terms of human resources with business strategies and corporate cultures. All interaction terms were non-signiﬁcant. The results supported hypothesis 2a and hypothesis 2c but not hypothesis 2b. Overall F-statistics were highly signiﬁcant. VIF statistics showed no problem of multicollinearity. turnover Staff turnover is an important organizational outcome. Using the same procedure, we evaluated the relative effects of HR types, organizational culture, and business strategy on turnover rates. Results are summarized in Table 6. Again, the control variables did not show signiﬁcant effects on staff turnover. HR systems as a whole added a signiﬁcant effect, as indicated by the signiﬁcant changes in R2. When these two HR systems were entered individually, the ß coefﬁcients were not signiﬁcant. Organizational culture as a group had no signiﬁcant impact on turnover, except a signiﬁcant ß coefﬁcient for 2302 I.H.S. Chow and S.S.

Business strategy as a whole added a signiﬁcant change, particularly for quality enhancing strategy. Organizations pursing a high quality strategy reduced their staff turnover rate. The interactions of HR and business strategy as a whole produced a signiﬁcant impact on turnover. Signiﬁcant interactions were observed for Inducement-HR*supportive culture, Inducement-HR*quality, Involvement- HR*quality, and Involvement-HR*competitive. The results offer some support for a contingent relationship between strategy and HR systems. Hypothesis 3a was supported for turnover but not for performance outcome. Hypothesis 3b was rejected. We plotted the interaction effects that were statistically signiﬁcant in Table 6. Figures 2 to 5 display the pattern of signiﬁcant interaction terms. Inducement-HR matching with a high supportive culture resulted in a signiﬁcantly lower staff turnover, while a low supportive culture substantially increased staff turnover (Figure 2). The same pattern was observed in Figure 4 with involvement-HR and competitive strategy. Graphically, Figures 3 and 5 show that an organization that pursues a high quality strategy signiﬁcantly reduces staff turnover for both inducement and involvement-HR. Discussion This study examines the differential impact of a culture and business strategy alignment through which two sets or systems of HR practices may affect ﬁrm performance. The results showed that both inducement-HR and involvement-HR had direct impacts on enhancing performance outcome but no signiﬁcant effect in reducing the turnover rate. The results also revealed a different linkage of HR with organizational culture and HR with business strategy on staff turnover. For HR-culture ﬁt, organizations with supportive culture tend to foster information sharing and encourage cooperative team work. This is consistent with the philosophy of the inducement-HR system that encourages and rewards cooperation and sharing. If employers offer a high level of inducements, employees may feel obliged to reciprocate through working harder and would be less likely to quit. Involvement-HR systems that encourage participation, autonomy, and challenge work well with a competitive culture to reduce staff turnover. The research ﬁndings do not lend much support to the expected effect of bureaucratic culture. Organizational culture did not have any interaction effect with both HR types on performance outcomes. In HR-strategy link, both involvement-HR and inducement-HR type work well, particularly with a quality business strategy, in reducing staff turnover rate. A ﬁrm’s commitment to quality has been found to be important to its performance. Organizations pursing an innovative strategy demand higher capability from their employees and greater responsiveness to change in market demands (Yan and Zhang 2003). An HR system Figure 2. The interaction between inducement and supportive. 2306 I.H.S. Chow and S.S. Liu Figure 3. The interaction between inducement and quality strategy. incorporating information sharing and participative problem-solving will facilitate responsiveness to change and innovation. Both inducement-HR and involvement-HR matched with a quality business strategy resulted in a lower staff turnover rate. These ﬁndings imply that organizations may be well advised to focus on a quality-enhancing strategy. The results from the present study demonstrate that an HR-culture and HR-business strategy linkage exists to some extent. Organizational effectiveness is contingent on HR systems with an appropriate culture and aligning with business strategy. Organizational culture has a strong inﬂuence on its chosen HR system. HRM contributes most to ﬁrm performance when it is aligned with business strategy (Gunnigle and Moore 1994). The ﬁndings reiterate the importance for companies of designing an integrated HR system consistent with their organizational culture and business strategy. The conventional thinking is that China’s massive labour force and HR system supports a business strategy primarily by controlling costs. Contrary to our expectations, the results of this study demonstrated that the traditional control system (viz. bureaucratic culture) did not signiﬁcantly beneﬁt ﬁrm performance. Instead, the ﬁrm’s commitment to quality was shown to be an important determinant of ﬁrm performance. Quality, based on a more participatory work system, pays off. Practical implications The results suggest some insights into the design of HRM systems. It is important to link HR to a speciﬁc business strategy and to create the culture necessary to execute these business strategies more effectively to gain competitive advantage. This can be understood best Figure 4. The interaction between involvement and competitive culture. The International Journal of Human Resource Management 2307 Figure 5. The interaction between involvement and quality strategy. by identifying distinct, internally consistent sets of HR practices and their relationships to organizational culture, business strategy, and performance outcomes. The results of this study demonstrate that HR practices need to be contingent upon the ﬁrm’s business strategy to be effective (Schuler and Jackson 1987; Delery and Doty 1996). Organizational culture shapes HR policies that are internally consistent and that suit the organization’s strategy. Hence, the alignment has major implications for developing an HRM system which requires the nurturing of organizational culture and ensuring that it is consistent with the business strategy. The study offers a richer understanding of the ﬁt between HR, culture, and strategy and organizational effectiveness. The results could be useful to HR professionals in creating an organizational culture that supports business strategies to enhance organizational effectiveness. HR directors are expected to play a more strategic role in their organizations and forge a strategic linkage with business strategy. Attention should be paid to designing HR systems best able to link the desired culture and business strategy. Simply focusing on the traditional HR practices, bureaucratic culture, and low cost may not beneﬁt ﬁrm performance. Obstacles such as an overly bureaucratic infrastructure and procedures need to be removed. Signiﬁcant improvement will occur when action is taken to increase supportive cultures for inducement-HR and competitive culture for involvement-HR. In terms of business strategy, quality enhancement is most important. Innovation is a risky strategy for organizations that do not emphasize involvement HR practices. Last, but not least, the limitations of the study should be acknowledged. The use of the Likert scale in eliciting opinions may have introduced an element of the subjective. As a consequence, the results might be artiﬁcially inﬂated. Yet perceptual measures of ﬁrm performance have been extensively used in survey research (Delaney and Huselid 1996), especially in China, where systematic reliable data on ﬁrm performance is lacking. In addition to self-reported perceptual measures of performance outcomes, the potential problem of common method variance cannot be avoided if all variables are collected from the same respondent in the same survey (Doty and Glick 1998). Following Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee and Podsakoff (2003), we checked for the presence of common method bias by conducting Harman’s one factor test in our data. A principal component factor analysis with an unrotated solution shows that no single factor accounted for a majority of the covariance in the variables. Common method variance is unlikely to be a serious problem. The cross-sectional nature of the data makes causality difﬁcult to establish. Conclusion To conclude, the involvement-HR system, an HR strategy that has been extensively studied in recent years, clearly gains support in the present study. Inducement-HR, which 2308 I.H.S. Chow and S.S. Liu emphasizes efﬁciency and using pay as incentives, works well in China in enhancing ﬁrm performance. The synergistic impact is most prominent when these practices are consistently integrated into a whole system. Each of these HR systems works if it ﬁts the prevailing business strategy and culture. An HR system should be congruent with the ﬁrm’s strategy and create an appropriate culture to enhance organizational effectiveness. References Arthur, J.B.
