Journal of Operations Management 17 1998 59–75 (cid:14) . The TQM Paradox: Relations among TQM practices, plant performance, and customer satisfaction Thomas Y. Choi ), Karen Eboch Department of Management, College of Business Administration, Bowling Green State Uni˝ersity, Bowling Green, OH 43403-0270, USA Received 14 January 1997; accepted 17 November 1997 Abstract We empirically examine a mediational model of TQM, in which TQM practices have a direct impact on customer satisfaction and an indirect impact mediated through plant performance. We adopt a survey approach using the data from 339 manufacturing companies. We first establish convergent validity, discriminant validity, and reliability of the constructs. We then examine the model using LISREL 8.10. The results suggest paradoxical relations among TQM practices, plant performance, and customer satisfaction. TQM practices have a stronger impact on customer satisfaction than they do on plant performance. Further, the plant performance, as described in the mediational model, fails to show a significant impact on customer satisfaction. This observation is explained based on an institutional argument that states that loose coupling may occur between TQM practices designed for customer demands and the activities on the plant floor designed for plant performance. q 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Introduction US manufacturing firms have faced heightened challenges from global competitors and a reduced market share during the past two decades Meredith, 1992; Krajewski and Ritzman, 1996 . To renew their competitiveness, many firms have adopted the prac- tices of total quality management TQM , and their experiences have been detailed in many books and articles see, e.g., the cases presented in Dean and (cid:14) .

Evans, 1994; George and Weimerskirch, 1994; Ross, 1995 . In general, in the literature, TQM is described as a collective, interlinked system of quality prac- tices that is associated with organizational perfor- mance GAO, 1991; Tornow and Wiley, 1991; Waldman, 1994; Madu et al., 1995 and customer satisfaction Anderson et al., 1994a,b; Dean and Bowen, 1994; Reeves and Bednar, 1994; Spencer, 1994 . Further, many authors e.g., Dean and Bowen, 1994; Dew, 1994; George and Weimerskirch, 1994; Capon et al., 1995r1994; Ross, 1995; Black and Porter, 1996 implicitly suggested a positive associa- tion among TQM practices, organization perfor- mance, and customer satisfaction, by adopting the framework of the Malcolm Baldrige National Qual- ity Award in their TQM model; the Baldrige Award .

EbochrJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 59–75 ( ) incorporates these three constructs in the assessment of TQM in an organization. . . (cid:14) . (cid:14) However, there appears to be ambivalence sur- rounding this positive association. Conflicting re- ports have been published regarding the effective- ness of TQM programs. For instance, although Rate- gan 1992 reported a 90% improvement rate in employee relations, operating procedures, customer satisfaction, and financial performance, Burrows (cid:14) 1992 reported a 95% failure rate for initiated TQM programs. McKinsey and company also found that two-thirds of the TQM programs they examined were terminated, because these programs did not lead to expected results Economist, 1992 . Further- more, the empirical investigation of how much of organizational performance brought on by TQM practices, in turn, affects customer satisfaction ap- pears to be non-existent. Although we found studies (cid:14) that associated organizational performance e.g., . (cid:14) quality service and customer satisfaction e.g., . Tornow and Wiley, 1991; Taylor and Baker, 1994 , authors of these studies did not consider the overall impact of actual TQM practices on this relationship. If we give credence to the conflicting reports about TQM, we are forced to consider that TQM practices may add disappointingly little to organiza- tional performance, and thus little to the satisfaction of to be performance-conscious. At the same time, we cannot disregard the mountainous literature, some of which is cited above, that pointed out TQM as the pathway to organizational performance and customer satisfac- tion. In this paper, we intend to add additional insights into this seemingly paradoxical dynamic of TQM practices, organizational performance, and cus- tomer satisfaction. To the best of our knowledge, no researchers have empirically examined these three constructs of TQM in a single model. These relation- ships are depicted as a mediational model see Baron and Kenny, 1986 in Fig. 1. customers who are thought the (cid:14) . Because the manufacturing industry has led the quality initiatives Dertouzos et al., 1989; Womack (cid:14) Fig. 1. A mediational model of TQM. . et al., 1990 , we studied the TQM activities in that industry. We focused on plant operations, and we regarded plants as our unit of analysis. Conse- quently, the term customers refers to industrial cus- tomers. Therefore, in which we are studying the dynamics of TQM is the supply chain (cid:14) e.g., Ellram, 1991; Bamford, 1994 that exists up- stream to the consumer market. the context . 2. Literature review (cid:14) (cid:14) (cid:14) . (cid:14) In the special issue of the Academy of Manage- ment Re˝iew, which was dedicated to ‘Total Quality,’ Dean and Bowen 1994 , in their lead article, offered an overarching perspective that the entire quality management effort must be focused on achieving customer satisfaction. Three articles that followed . echoed this perspective. Reeves and Bednar 1994 suggested that the historical definitions of quality espouse customer or consumer satisfaction as the . ultimate goal of quality management. Spencer 1994 introduced three models of TQM mechanistic, or- . ganismic, and cultural three models suggest quality as conforming to or satisfy- ing internal or external customers. Anderson et al. (cid:14) 1994a,b summarized Deming’s TQM principles and delineated customer satisfaction as the final outcome of quality management. Researchers e.g., Waldman, 1994; Madu et al., 1995 have acknowledged orga- nization performance as another key construct of the TQM model. McCune 1989 described performance management as the key source of customer satisfac- tion. According to the model forwarded by Anderson et al. 1994b , quality performance outcomes are driven by quality management practices, which, in turn, leads to customer satisfaction. and argued that all . (cid:14) . (cid:14) (cid:14) . . Therefore, these theoretical discussions offer gen- eral support for the significance of the constructs shown in the mediational model of TQM in Fig. 1: TQM practices, plant performance, and customer satisfaction. In the remainder of Section 2, we re- view more carefully the literature related to these three main constructs. We examine the extent to which authors of the extant literature support or do not support the relations among these three con- structs. Finally, we summarize the literature into specific propositions. T.Y. Choi, K. EbochrJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 59–75 ( ) 61 2.1. TQM practices (cid:14) . Built on a systems perspective Dean and Bowen, 1994; Hackman and Wageman, 1995 , the Baldrige Award framework of TQM is used to emphasize the importance of how different organizational practices, including such seemingly disparate areas as human resources management, quality control, and informa- tion analysis, work together to increase an organiza- tion’s performance. Many researchers have adopted the Baldrige Award framework as the basic model of TQM: Dean and Bowen 1994 used it to explore the relationship between the principles of TQM and management theories; Black and Porter 1996 used it to develop and validate their TQM survey ques- tions; and Capon et al., 1995r1994 used it to iden- tify key measures of TQM success. According to the Baldrige Award framework, there are four areas of management practices within the TQM system to assess: management of process quality, human re- sources management, strategic quality planning, and information and analysis. (cid:14) . (cid:14) . . (cid:14) (cid:14) Management of process quality entails monitor- ing of work processes and improving operational variations Feigenbaum, 1951; Juran, 1951; Crosby, 1979; Deming, 1986; Juran, 1989; Anderson et al., 1994b; Dean and Bowen, 1994; Goetsch and Davis, 1994 . Data are gathered and analyzed, and correc- tive actions are taken to improve the work process. When human resource management practices are used, workers on the shop floor become the center of the plant’s improvement efforts Deming, 1986; Dean and Bowen, 1994; George and Weimerskirch, 1994; Waldman, 1994; Hackman and Wageman, 1995; Pegels, 1995; Ross, 1995 . In this case, workers’ intellect and skills are cultivated. Employee involve- ment is encouraged, and management creates a re- ward system conducive to employee involvement. Strategic quality planning can be referred to as designing internal functions to reflect the organiza- tion’s mission Juran, 1989; Dean and Bowen, 1994; Goetsch and Davis, 1994 . It is used to keep the organization focused on the chosen objectives. As long-term goals are projected by management, the operational decisions at all levels are made to remain consistent with these goals. Information and analysis practices are used to emphasize the importance of data-based, factual decision-making Dean and (cid:14) . . (cid:14) Bowen, 1994; Hackman and Wageman, 1995 . In this case, decisions to improve quality and productiv- ity are made based on concrete data and analysis. Information from and about customers is collected and distributed within the organization. . 2.2. Plant performance Plant performance refers to quality, cost, and delivery outcomes of the plant. Examples of specific measures of plant performance include production down time, on-time delivery, internal and external reject rates, costs per unit produced, and inventory turnover ratio. (cid:14) . (cid:14) . (cid:14) Many authors have suggested that TQM practices can have a positive impact on a firm’s quality and productivity results e.g., Goetsch and Davis, 1994; Pegels, 1995 . For instance, Bounds et al. 1994 and . George and Weimerskirch 1994 suggested that TQM practices should lead to decreased internal and external product reject rates and production down- time. TQM practices also should increase the overall efficiency of plant operation. Based on his experi- ence, Thomas 1989 claimed that TQM leads to improvement in total production cycle time, level of inventories, productivity, and delivery lead time. However, most of these claims were based on anec- dotal evidence, and systematic studies correlating TQM practices and quality and operational results are rare. (cid:14) . . . (cid:14) . (cid:14) There have been a few exceptions. The General Accounting Office GAO filed a report on the rela- tionship between quality management practices and organization performance GAO, 1991 . A study . based on survey research by Flynn et al. 1995 established a positive relationship between TQM practices and plant operation i.e., cycle time im- provement . Adam 1994 found a strong relation- ship between quality improvement approaches stat- istical process control, reward, and . performance quality scrap, rework, inspection, etc. . More recently, a few authors have presented empiri- cally developed and validated constructs of TQM (cid:14) Ahire et al., 1996; Black and Porter, 1996 . Al- though they did not offer an empirical argument for the relationships among the TQM constructs, Black and Porter 1996 implicitly assumed a positive rela- tionship by building their instrument based on the Baldrige Award framework. training, etc. (cid:14) .

(cid:14) (cid:14) However, as alluded to previously, some authors have argued that TQM has little to do with the actual improvement of performance results Broetzmann et al., 1995 , and some view TQM as a fad, which was discussed by Neal and Tromley 1995 . An Arthur D. Little survey of 500 executives in US manufactur- ing and service firms indicated that ‘‘only one-third believe that TQM made them more competitive’’ (cid:14) Economist, 1992; Mathews and Katel, 1992 . In a survey by A.T. Kearney of 100 British firms that had implemented quality programs, only one-fifth ex- pressed that their programs had a significant impact . on organizational effectiveness Economist, 1992 . Further, in an American Electronics Association sur- vey, 63% of the firms reported that TQM practices failed to reduce defects by 10% or more, even when these practices had been implemented for more than . two and half years Eskildson, 1994 . . (cid:14) (cid:14) 2.3. Customer satisfaction . . (cid:14) The impact of TQM practices on customer satis- faction is less disputed than its impact on plant performance results. Both Deming 1986 and Juran (cid:14) 1986 promoted customer satisfaction as the ulti- mate goal of TQM. Deming suggested that the goal of firms should be to constantly improve their ser- vices and products for the customers, and Juran defined quality as fitness for use, or the ability of a service or product to satisfy a customer’s needs. Further, many leading firms such as IBM, Xerox, and 3M have claimed that their TQM efforts have contributed to increased customer satisfaction Ross, 1995 . For instance, one of the key effects of TQM practices has been on employee involvement and empowerment, which has a positive impact on cus- (cid:14) . tomer Flood, 1993; Ross, 1995 . Through empowerment, management avails its work- ers increased access to information and resources and delegates decision-making Blau and Alba, 1982; Ahire et al., 1996 . When empowered employees come in contact with customers, workers remain flexible and responsive to satisfying the needs of the customers. satisfaction (cid:14) (cid:14) . . Dean and Bowen 1994 suggested that the study of customer satisfaction typically falls under the domain of marketing. In general, authors of the marketing literature concur with the observation that TQM practices lead to customer satisfaction Babich, (cid:14) (cid:14) . . indicator of a firm’s overall 1992; Rust and Zahorik, 1993; Anderson et al., 1994a . They portray customer satisfaction as an important financial health, largely because it is perceived to be a key indicator of a firm’s market share and profitability. Simply stated, a satisfied customer will repeat his or her purchases of the goods or services, increasing a . firm’s market share and profits. Zairi et al. 1994 argued that TQM practices lead to improvement of the bottom-line results such as profits and returns on assets. It follows, then, that TQM practices will have a positive impact on the firm’s market share and profits, although mediated through customer satisfac- tion. Therefore, there appears to be support for a positive relationship between TQM practices and customer satisfaction. (cid:14) 2.4. Formulation of propositions There are three relationships portrayed in our TQM model shown in Fig. 1. We will reemphasize the main arguments of the literature and state each of these associations as a formal proposition. . (cid:14) Overall, there is consistent support for a positive relationship between TQM practices and customer satisfaction e.g., Deming, 1986; Juran, 1986; Flood, 1993; Anderson et al., 1994b; Dean and Bowen, 1994; Ross, 1995 . However, as discussed previ- ously, there have been conflicting reports about how TQM practices lead to the expected performance results of a firm e.g., Burrows, 1992; Economist, . 1992; Eskildson, 1994; Broetzmann et al., 1995 . Regarding the negative reports, authors do not neces- sarily argue that TQM is ‘bad’ for the firm or it has no positive impact on the firm; they generally con- tend that TQM does lead to the performance gains in quality and operational results, albeit such gains are less than the expectations of the firms. (cid:14) . (cid:14) Few authors have addressed the relationship be- tween performance results and customer satisfaction. McCune 1989 offered a conceptual model in which an organization’s performance leads to customer sat- isfaction. Tornow and Wiley 1991 also argued, based on an empirical study, that there was a positive relationship between operational performance and customer satisfaction. However, the overall relation- ships they noted are, in fact, quite weak. They offered six indicators of organization performance and seven indicators of customer satisfaction. Of 42 (cid:14) . T.Y. Choi, K. EbochrJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 59–75 ( ) 63 possible combinations of relationships, only 7 rela- tionships were significant. Although marketing re- searchers have conducted studies on the relationship between performance and customer satisfaction, they focus mainly on the consumer satisfaction regarding the performance of the purchased products Tse and Wilton, 1988; Zeithaml, 1988; Anderson et al., 1994a,b; Taylor and Baker, 1994 . Therefore, it may be difficult to draw applicable conclusions for the industrial purchasing context where the interaction occurs between two organizations. (cid:14) . . (cid:14) Overall, the positive relationships are suggested among the three constructs in the TQM model e.g., Dean and Bowen, 1994; Capon et al., 1995r1994; Ross, 1995 Black and Porter, 1996 . However, the levels of support for these relationships vary. In general, there is less dispute about the impact of TQM practices on customer satisfaction than the impact it has on plant performance results. Also, the strength of the positive relationship between plant performance, as affected by TQM practices, and customer satisfaction, is still quite uncertain. In sum, the level of impact may vary among the three con- structs of Fig. 1. In this study, the level of impact is operationalized by the level of correlation coefficient . —according to Backstrom and Hursh-Cesar 1981 , the level of correlations measures the level of impact one construct has on the other, as the squared term of the correlation coefficient represents explained vari- ance that the associated two constructs have in com- mon. Therefore, we offer the following propositions to guide our study. (cid:14) Proposition 1: TQM practices ha˝e a strong im- pact on customer satisfaction. Proposition 2: TQM practices ha˝e a moderate impact on plant performance. Proposition 3: Plant performance has a weak impact on customer satisfaction. 3. Data collection 3.1. Sur˝ey instrument A list of TQM activities was compiled based on the extant literature e.g., Feigenbaum, 1951; Juran, 1951; Crosby, 1979; Deming, 1986; Sashkin and (cid:14) (cid:14) . Kiser, 1991; Wellins et al., 1993; Dean and Bowen, 1994; Ross, 1995 . The list was categorized into the four areas of a TQM system as specified in the Baldrige framework—process quality, human re- sources, strategic quality planning, and information and analysis see Appendix A . We studied TQM in the industrial context e.g., customer as an industrial buyer in the supply system and focused on the activities on the shop floor. For example, we probed for the involvement of workers on the shop floor for managing ‘process quality’ and addressed such is- sues as ‘problem-solving techniques are actively used by the workers on the shop floor’. . (cid:14) . Once compiled, the survey form was refined through a series of reviews by external judges. Oper- ations management faculty were used as expert judges for content ˝alidation to determine how well the chosen items represented the defined constructs. Ex- ecutive MBA students and plant managers at six manufacturing sites in the targeted industries were interviewed while they reviewed the questionnaire to identify any language ambiguities and perceived omissions of other TQM practices used in manufac- turing plants but not included in the survey. The discrepancies and comments were used to further refine the instrument. 3.2. Sample We compiled a list of transportation and electron- ics parts manufacturers located in Ohio as the target sample, based on the 1994 Ohio Manufacturer’s List. The state of Ohio is in the heart of the US manufacturing belt. According to the Harris Ohio Industrial Directory, 1995, Ohio is the nation’s third leading manufacturing state, and, according to the SSTI Profile-Ohio 1997 , 27.4% of Ohio’s gross state product GSP comes from manufacturing vs. 18.6% of the GNP. In this regard, data from Ohio may be more representative than data from smaller states with less manufacturing emphasis. (cid:14) . . (cid:14) The SIC code, which identifies groups of com- mon manufacturing processes and technologies, was used to identify the organizations. The actual SIC codes were selected from the companies in the 3400 to 3700 range of industries, which represents fabri- cated metal products, industrial machinery and equipment, electronic and other electric equipment, and transportation equipment. Based on the industry 64 T.Y. Choi, K. EbochrJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 59–75 ( ) descriptions provided at the four-digit level, 55 clas- sifications were selected that related to automotive and electrical manufacturing. Plant managers were determined as the most ap- propriate respondents, because they are most familiar with their plant’s operating practices and perfor- mance outcomes. Of the 1679 mailed surveys, 67 were returned as undeliverable. Within two months of mailing, 339 completed surveys were returned, which was a 21% response rate. (cid:14) . According to the responses to the demographic questions regarding principal products and plant size, the sample was generally representative of the tar- geted industries, but responding plants were, in gen- eral, larger than the sample’s reported norms. The target population had a mean sales of US$23.5 mil- lion and 183 employees, according to the Ohio Man- ufacturer’s List 1994 ; however, the survey respon- dents reported a mean of US$40.8 million and 286 employees. It is possible that plant managers of larger companies had more readily accessible data and were able to take the time to complete and return the surveys. It is also possible that some organiza- tional growth had occurred, because there was a . two-year gap between the database figures 1993 and survey results 1995 . According to the Ohio Department of Development, Ohio showed the high- est manufacturing growth among all 50 states in the United States during this period. (cid:14) (cid:14) . 4. Analysis and results We began the measurement analysis by first es- tablishing the convergent validity and discriminant validity of the three key constructs—TQM practices, plant performance, and customer satisfaction. We then proceeded to assess the instrument’s reliability or the ability of its scales to consistently yield the same response. We assessed construct validity or extent to which the items in the scale measured one dominant dimension. Once the scales were deter- mined to be reliable and valid, a correlation matrix was constructed for all items under TQM practices, plant performance, and customer satisfaction. We recognized that the model shown in Fig. 1 is a mediational model, and each of the three constructs has multiple indicators attached. Baron and Kenny . (cid:14) 1986 recommended using a structural modeling technique to examine a mediational model with mul- tiple indicators. Therefore, we ran a structural model using LISREL 8.10. We used the final correlation matrix as the input in the LISREL run. 4.1. Con˝ergent and discriminant ˝alidity Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to address the convergent and discriminant validity of the constructs. We first examined the convergent validity of all TQM scales to their respective con- structs—process quality, human resource manage- ment, strategic quality planning, and information and loading at analysis. All scales showed significant . 0.05 level e.g., their t-values were greater than 2.0 . We aggregated the scores for all four TQM con- structs, after reversing the scores of the reverse-scaled . indicators see Appendix A . (cid:14) (cid:14) We then proceeded to examine the convergent and discriminant validity of the three key con- structs–TQM practices with four indicators, plant performance with 10 indicators, and customer satis- faction with nine indicators. All indicators showed significant loading except two under plant perfor- . mance on-time delivery and inventory turnovers , which were subsequently dropped from further anal- ysis. The results, as shown in Table 1, demonstrate the convergent validity of the constructs. (cid:14) . To examine the discriminant validity, the uncon- strained model and the constrained models were compared—each model has three latent constructs (cid:14)TQM practices, plant performance, and customer satisfaction . The unconstrained model allows the correlation between all three pairs of the three con- structs to vary, and the constrained model fixes one of the three pairs to 1.0—in essence, the constrained model converts a three-construct model into a two- construct model. If the unconstrained model is more parsimonious than each of three constrained models, based on the x2 statistic, we establish that the two models are different; thus, the correlation of a con- strained pair should be allowed to vary or should be a value less than 1.0. In other words, the x2 for the constrained model are compared with the x2 for the unconstrained model Anderson and Gerbing, 1988; Podsakoff and MacKenzie, 1994 . Significantly lower x2 for the unconstrained models would indicate that (cid:14) . Table 1 Convergent validity of constructs Constructs X 1 X 2 X 3 X4 X5 X6 X 7 X 8 X 9 Range of t-values TQM practices Plant performance Customer satisfaction 0.68 0.05 0.58 0.06 0.59 0.05 (cid:14) (cid:14) (cid:14) . . . 0.66 0.05 0.70 0.06 0.62 0.05 (cid:14) (cid:14) (cid:14) . . . 0.76 0.05 0.16 0.06 0.55 0.05 (cid:14) (cid:14) (cid:14) . . . 0.62 0.05 0.68 0.06 0.55 0.05 (cid:14) (cid:14) (cid:14) . . . 0.29 0.06 0.61 0.05 (cid:14) (cid:14) . . 0.37 0.06 0.48 0.06 (cid:14) (cid:14) . . 0.36 0.06 0.56 0.05 (cid:14) (cid:14) . . 0.37 0.06 0.29 0.06 (cid:14) (cid:14) . . 0.68 0.05 (cid:14) . 11.42–14.70 5.21–13.31 5.04–13.13 T Y . .

In our case, for all three pairs of constructs, the x2 for the uncon- strained model was significantly less than the x2 for the constrained model, as shown in Table 2. 4.2. Reliability and ˝alidity of scales Our focus was then turned to examine more closely the reliability and validity of the scales. We accepted the results of the confirmatory analysis and left out the two plant performance indicators that lacked convergent validity. We examined the internal consistency of all three constructs first by a factor analysis and, second, by reliability testing of Cron- bach’s alpha. Our approach hereafter was modeled (cid:14) 1994 who used largely ex- after Flynn et al. . Table 3 Overall internal consistency of scales ploratory analysis to examine the scales. Bagozzi et al. 1991 suggested that confirmatory analysis and exploratory analysis can supplement each other. (cid:14) . the question item, ‘quality data just As alluded to previously, several items were de- signed to be reverse-scored, and they were modified accordingly before any scale analysis was done. For example, to show to the customers’, was considered to reflect an undesirable practice; therefore, to maintain the con- sistency with the other questions, its direction was reversed. Appendix A provides a general description of the final items used in the scales. A minus sign is shown next to the items that had a reverse scaling. Each of the scales associated with TQM practices, plant performance, and customer satisfaction were analyzed separately. All the indicators included within each of the individual constructs were thought to load together as one factor, so no varimax rotation was needed during the factor analysis.

The alpha scores ranged from 0.92 for TQM strategic quality planning to 0.48 for delivery results. Al- though an alpha of 0.5 may be acceptable Hair et al., 1995 , following the practice of Flynn et al. (cid:14) 1994 , an alpha of 0.6 and above was considered an effective reliability level for judging a scale of this type. Therefore, the delivery aspect of quality and operational results construct with an alpha value of 0.48 was eliminated. (cid:14) . . (cid:14) To further examine the scales we used, an addi- tional analysis using Cronbach’s alpha was com- pleted through which we analyzed the scales’ inter- nal consistency by ownership and industry of the respondents see Table 4 . The industry types were broken into three categories to reflect the identifica- tion provided by the plant managers when they identified their core businesses. Metal stamping and coating was an industry designation separated from auto and electronics industries by the respondents. This distinction was, therefore, carried over into the .

If the resulting ownership and industry alphas were not consistently above the 0.6 level, demonstrating the validity and reliability of the scales among the different subcategories of respondents, the scale was dropped from further analysis. The final scales and the strength of the factor loading on to each dimension are provided in Table 5. The process quality factor included maintenance issues, problem-solving activities, and usage of qual- ity data. The human resources factor included the items of rewards, training, idea generation, and feed- back. The strategic quality planning factor was the strongest in terms of indicators holding together, which ranged from top management commitment and mission to production layout issues. The infor- mation and analysis factor included the items involv- ing data tracking, role of data in decision-making, and plant–customer interface. The cost and delivery factors were dropped from the performance results. Only indicators of quality results maintained their measurement integrity external reject rate, internal reject rate, and product downtime . Also, the cost factor was eliminated from the customer satisfaction construct, but measurements of quality e.g., reliabil- ity, technical innovation and delivery e.g., consis- tent delivery, short delivery lead times were re- tained. The items that remained for further analysis are italicized in Appendix A. (cid:14) (cid:14) (cid:14) . . . 4.3. Relationships in the mediational model of TQM Once the scales were determined as reliable and valid, correlation coefficients for the TQM practices, plant performance, and customer satisfaction mea- sures were determined using the Pearson product coefficients. Table 6 shows the resulting r and p values based on a two-tailed t-test. All intracorrela- tions within the TQM practices and customer satis- faction constructs were significant at ps0.01 level. Because it had only one factor, there were no intra- correlations within the quality indicator of plant per- formance. All intercorrelations were positive, but not all were significant. Using this correlational table as input, a structural model was run using LISREL 8.10. Because there was only one indicator attached to plant performance as shown in Table 6, the residual variance for that indicator was fixed to zero to run the program. The Fig. 2. Correlations within the mediational model of TQM. (cid:14) . (cid:14) LISREL estimations were completed after 24 itera- tions. Based on maximum likelihood estimations, the linkages between TQM practices and plant perfor- mance and between TQM practices and customer satisfaction showed significant t values at 2.50 and 6.52, respectively. However, the linkage between plant performance and customer satisfaction was not significant with a t value at 0.13. The correlations among the three constructs are shown in Fig. 2. The present model showed a good fit—the comparative fit index CFI of Bentler 1990 was 0.96, and the Tucker and Lewis 1973 index TLI was 0.94. The x statistic was 38.31 d.f.s12, p -0.001 , which failed to achieve non-significance. However, this is not necessarily an indicator for poor fit, because models with good fit are known to be falsely rejected by x2 tests due to bias stemming from either non- normality or sample size or both Podsakoff and MacKenzie, 1994; Rich, 1997 . In this regard, the CFI and TLI are found to be resistant to this bias (cid:14) Marsh et al., 1988 , and since CFI and TLI are well above the recommended level of 0.90, the model is considered to be a reasonable representation of the . data Hair et al., 1995 . .

As shown in Fig. 2, all correlations among the three constructs in the model are positive. TQM practices are significantly correlated at the 0.05 level 70 T.Y. Choi, K.

According to the institutional theory, organizations are dependent . on external constituencies e.g., customers for re- sources. In order to ensure the continued flow of the needed resources e.g., orders , organizations con- form to the wishes of the external constituencies (cid:14) e.g., implementing TQM practices . It is believed that this type of conformance leads to increased goodwill and legitimacy with external constituencies and, thus, ensures the organization’s long-term sur- vival Meyer and Rowan, 1977; DiMaggio and Pow- ell, 1983 . However, an organization’s internal goal . for performance e.g., meeting productivity targets and external demands for conformance e.g., imple- menting quality practices may initially conflict; for . instance, generating statistical process control SPC data may actually slow down the production line. As a defense mechanism to overcome the conflict, the managers will try to ‘loosely couple’ Meyer and Rowan, 1977 the activities of the technical core (cid:14) i.e., production activities on plant floor and the (cid:14) i.e., compiling and sending administrative actions SPC data to the customer . In other words, the activities of the technical core and the administrative level are treated, at least initially, as independent components of management. (cid:14) (cid:14) . (cid:14) (cid:14) . . . with customer satisfaction with the correlation of 0.63. TQM practices are significantly correlated also with plant performance at the 0.05 level, although at a considerably weaker correlation of 0.15. However, the link between plant performance and customer satisfaction shows a correlation of 0.10, but it failed to show significance at the 0.05 level. Although the correlations are all positive, different strengths of correlations appear among the constructs. Therefore, the results substantiate the suspected TQM paradox regarding the relations among TQM practices, plant performance, and customer satisfac- tion. We offer the following explanation as the pri- mary reason for this paradox: Manufacturing plants are as much an entity of performance that seeks quality and efficiency as an entity of institutionaliza- tion and political dynamics that seeks legitimacy and goodwill of the customers. We explicate this point in the remainder of this paper. Consider the two correlations involving TQM practices. They suggest that TQM practices have a positive impact on customer satisfaction and plant performance; however, there is a rather large dis- crepancy in the magnitude of correlations between these two relationships. What are the causes of such differences in the relationships among the con- structs? A few authors e.g., Choi and Wasti, 1995; Neal and Tromley, 1995 pointed out that many manufac- turing plants had to implement TQM practices be- cause their industrial customers explicitly demanded them to do so. This view is entirely consistent with the supply chain management literature that suggests industrial customers as the driver of quality dissemi- nation across the supply chain Ellram, 1991; Bam- ford, 1994; Raia, 1994; Purchasing, 1995 . If so, from the plant managers’ perspective, the most im- mediate objective is to satisfy their industrial cus- tomers by complying with what they ask for. There- fore, when these managers implement TQM prac- tices that are promoted by their customers, they perceive what they are doing is more directly related to the customer satisfaction than to the plant’s per- formance. (cid:14) . This type of phenomenon can be studied further through an ‘institutional’ perspective that has roots in sociology and organization theory e.g., Meyer and Rowan, 1977; DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; (cid:14) (cid:14) . . (cid:14) The plant manager may eventually see the bene- fits of requested quality practices e.g., SPC to the plant performance but will continue to perceive that the primary objective of implementing the requested quality practices was to satisfy the customer. Sup- pose a customer asks a plant to implement SPC, so the plant manager sends the workers to the training course and installs the computer system to collect and display SPC data. Independent of how well SPC has been integrated into production and how well it is being used to control quality during production, the customer observes the implementation of SPC— the relevant equipment and the data displayed on screen during visits to the supplier plant. In the eyes of the customer, the supplier plant has complied the request; therefore, the customer is satisfied the strong correlation between TQM practices and customer satisfaction . The plant manager considers some ben- efits of SPC; for example, the quality control techni- cians have more data available for troubleshooting purposes the significant but weaker correlation be- . tween TQM practices and plant performance . (cid:14) (cid:14) . T.Y. Choi, K. EbochrJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 59–75 ( ) 71 (cid:14) . Once TQM practices are implemented e.g., sug- gestion programs, quality circles, display of ‘before and after’ pictures of improvements , they are con- ducive to direct observations during plant visits by customers. However, performance results such as internal or external reject rates must be accumulated over a period of time, and it may be that what is more visually immediate to the customers has a more direct impact on their level of satisfaction. Therefore, as evidenced in our data i.e., plant managers per- ceived lack of relationship between plant perfor- mance and customer satisfaction , plant managers may perceive customer satisfaction is driven less by their performance results than by their conformance to the customer’s requests. At the same time, the plant managers know that if they did not have the required performance they would jeopardize the long-term relationships with the present customers. (cid:14) . This observation brings us to the last linkage that was not statistically significant—the relationship be- tween the plant performance and customer satisfac- tion. Given that there is a loose coupling between what plants do to increase plant performance and what they do to satisfy the customer, as argued above, the plant manager would have difficulty see- ing the immediate relationship between plant perfor- mance and customer satisfaction. After all, cus- tomers seem to take satisfaction from seeing the plants conform to their requests—the implementa- tion of TQM practices. In other words, the part of plant performance improvement is gained through the implementation of TQM practices is thought to lead to little impact on customer satisfac- tion. Statistically speaking, the variance of plant performance that is explained by the TQM practices shows a statistically insignificant level of explained variance for customer satisfaction. that In summary, the institutional interpretation of the results offer insights into the paradoxical dynamics of TQM practices in plants. Powerful institutional actors such as industrial customers promote TQM practices, and their actions are sanctioned and rein- forced by the professional societies, universities, and governmental units. Consequently, plant managers succumb to this pressure and call for compliance. Plants duplicate the TQM practices, what institu- tional theorists call ‘legitimated elements,’ into their structures. This act of conformance leads to customer fortuitously matches satisfaction, but it has less direct impact on plant performance. However, the plant may gain perfor- mance benefits, albeit haphazardly, when their im- plementation the technical needs of the plant. In other words, because such changes were not driven by the internal needs justi- fied by the technical reasoning but by external needs justified by the institutional reasoning, their impact on the plant performance will occur on a ‘hit-or-miss’ basis. This observation may offer one explanation for why some organizations’ TQM initiatives may have led to failures, as discussed in the early part of this paper. If we accept the argument that the dissemina- tion of TQM practices followed institutional dynam- ics and the impact of TQM practices on the plant performance occurred haphazardly, it is not surpris- ing that some firms may have benefited from TQM practices and some firms have not. We are not suggesting here that TQM may be harmful for the organization in some cases; we are arguing, how- ever, that part of the reason why some firms have not reaped the benefits of TQM practices is because the motivation for implementing TQM was external or institutional, and they have not been able to apply the TQM practices to their operations on the shop . floor or ‘technical core’ Meyer and Rowan, 1977 . In this paper, we have described an empirical examination of the relations among the key con- structs of TQM and presented an institutional argu- ment for the results. The underlying assumption behind this argument is that the industrial customers have been the most salient source behind the said institutionalization process. We believe this is a rea- sonable assumption that follows from the literature; however, we understand that the degree of customer’s promotion of TQM practices may vary from one situation to another, and there are other institutional actors in the environment government, professional organizations, etc. , a point illustrated further in the section on future research. (cid:14) (cid:14) . A source of potential weakness of this paper is the perceptual measures of plant quality performance and customer satisfaction. Most firms now collect performance data, and it may be possible to gain more objective measures from plants. Customer sat- isfaction data also would be more reliable if it came from the customers rather than plant managers who 72 T.Y. Choi, K. EbochrJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 59–75 ( ) cater to those customers. However, firms are typi- cally reluctant to disclose exact figures of their per- formance data, but plant managers are well ac- quainted with the performance data and could give us an accurate assessment. Also, it would have been a daunting task to track down and receive feedback from the customers of hundreds of plants. For any study, there is a trade-off between the sample size and obtainment of objective performance results and customer satisfaction data e.g., the larger the sam- ple, the more difficult it would be to receive cus- tomer satisfaction data from the matching customer firms . We balanced this trade-off by using plant managers as respondents because they would be the most familiar with both performance data and cus- tomer satisfaction. (cid:14) . . (cid:14) The potentially damaging weakness is the issue of the common method variance Avolio et al., 1991 — in our case, data for all three constructs came from one respondent. Contending with the common meth- ods variance was a conscious choice on our part, because we had to consider the trade-off between the number of plants we surveyed versus getting multi- ple respondents from each plant. Given the con- straint, we felt that plant managers would be the correct people to inform us about all three constructs —TQM practices, plant performance, and customer satisfaction. However, when we received the data, we had to examine the effects of common method variance. The confirmatory analysis gave us a strong result validating the independence of the three con- structs. Therefore, although we did not solve the problem of the common method variance, we were reasonably confident that all three constructs were independent of one another. From the onset, our intent was to explore the topic in an uncharted area and to examine the puzzling relationships among TQM practices, plant performance, and customer satisfaction. Even with the stated weaknesses, we believed that we gained a glimpse of the dynamics that are described confusingly in the literature. We have only scratched the surface of the com- plex dynamics of institutionally driven quality initia- tives. As discussed in Section 6, our results have implications for other externally driven programs, such as ISO 9000. Research conclusions, consistent with our findings, are beginning to appear in publica- tions. For instance, Terziovski et al. 1997 failed to (cid:14) . find a significant effect of ISO 9000 on organiza- tional performance. Then, what should the manage- ment do? How could the management internalize this type of externally driven changes to reap the poten- tial performance benefits? Or do we just have to bite the bullet and concede that the benefits of these externally driven programs end at the institutional level and have little to no consequences on plant performance? 6. Implications for future research . (cid:14) This study revealed that the implementation of TQM practices in manufacturing plants has been geared more for customer satisfaction than for plant performance. This observation renders support for the institutional argument and suggests that there is a loose coupling Meyer and Rowan, 1977 taking place on the shop floor. At least theoretically, this type of loosely coupled state represents a ‘wasteful’ practice—it is wasteful to implement TQM practices mainly for show or to please the customer. We must question, then, what the managers of manufacturing plants and the industrial customers can do to mini- mize the expenditure of precious corporate resources that have unclear implications for plant performance. Furthermore, the future researchers should consider the organizational dynamics of initiatives that are similar to TQM, for example, ISO 9000 or QS 9000. These initiatives are unilaterally imposed on the companies by strong institutional pressures. Will we observe similar loose coupling in these instances? Research evidence already suggests in the affirma- tive Terziovski et al., 1997 . Then, what would be the efficiency implications of such initiatives? (cid:14) . Related to the organizational implications of insti- tutionally induced changes is the question of the degree of institutionalization process. How many TQM practices are implemented because of customer requests, and who else in the environment beside customers can promote TQM practices? It is cer- tainly possible that a the implementation of TQM can follow a technical process based on internal reasons rather than institutional reasons and b the pressure can come not only from the industrial cus- tomers but also from professional organizations and the mass media. In the future, researchers could (cid:14) . (cid:14) . T.Y. Choi, K. EbochrJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 59–75 ( ) 73 . (cid:14) investigate how different environmental technical and institutional pressures impinge on manufactur- ing plants and relate the organizational conse- quences. Also, since an institutional environment can be viewed as being fragmented DiMaggio, 1988 , it would be interesting to investigate the different sec- tors of institutional fields that have promoted TQM practices and their impact on TQM practices in plant operations. (cid:14) . We believe the implementation of TQM practices and the impact that these practices have on plant performance entail a dynamic process. First, as was argued, plants may discover over time the benefits of externally induced changes and, thus, reduce the degree of loose coupling that existed initially. In future studies that investigates the impact of TQM on performance and customer satisfaction, we would need to include time into our model. For instance, the mapping of the life cycle of TQM implementa- tion can be a useful focus, and testing time as a moderating as opposed to mediating variable be- tween TQM practices and customer satisfaction can also yield interesting results. In particular, during the early phase of the TQM implementation, outcome measures plant performance and customer satisfac- tion and TQM practices will interact heavily while plant managers and workers follow a learning curve. Therefore, the performance data and customer satis- faction data collected during this period may be very noisy. One way to overcome the impact of the noise would be to consider more direct measurement of plant performance and customer satisfaction rather than a perceptual measurement. . (cid:14) (cid:14) .
