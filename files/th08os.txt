Huckman Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts 02163 {zton@hbs.edu, rhuckman@hbs.edu} We examine the impact of employee turnover on operating performance in settings that require high levels of knowledge exploitation. Using 48 months of turnover data from U.S. stores of a major retail chain, we ﬁnd that, on average, employee turnover is associated with decreased performance, as measured by proﬁt margin and customer service. The effect of turnover on performance, however, is mitigated by the nature of management at the store level. The particular aspect of management on which we focus is process conformance—the extent to which managers aim to reduce variation in store operations in accordance with a set of prescribed standards for task performance. At high-process-conformance stores, managers use discipline in implementing standardized policies and procedures, whereas at low-process-conformance stores, managers tolerate deviations from these standards. We ﬁnd that increasing turnover does not have a negative effect on store performance at high-process-conformance stores; at low-process-conformance stores, the negative effect of turnover is pronounced. Our results suggest that, in settings where performance depends on the repetition of known tasks, managers can reduce turnover’s effect by imposing process discipline through standard operating procedures.

Employee turnover in organizations has received sub- stantial attention from both academics and managers. Much of this attention has been focused on understand- ing its causes. Implicit in this approach is the assumption that turnover is driven by certain identiﬁable character- istics of workers, tasks, ﬁrms, and markets, and that, by developing policies to address these characteristics, man- agers might reduce the occurrence of turnover in their respective organizations. As noted by several observers, however, the consequences of turnover have received signiﬁcantly less attention from researchers (Staw 1980, Mobley 1982, Glebbeek and Bax 2004). This lack of academic attention is particularly surprising given that industry studies have estimated the cost of turning over one employee earning $8 per hour at $3,500 to $25,000.1 In this paper, we address this latter issue through empir- ical examination of the impact of turnover on operating performance at stores in a large retail chain. We focus our empirical analysis on the retail industry for several reasons. First, retail accounts for a substan- tial portion of employment in the United States. Accord- ing to the National Retail Federation, in 2003 retailers in the United States employed more than 23 million people, nearly one out of every ﬁve American work- ers. Second, most retailers operate with very high levels of employee turnover, which makes retailing an impor- tant context in which to study this phenomenon. Finally, retail provides a setting in which performance tends to depend on the repetition of known tasks rather than on innovation. The difference between repetition and innovation evokes March’s (1991) distinction between exploitation and exploration. The relevance of this dis- tinction is addressed in the development of our hypothe- ses later in this paper. Our ﬁrst objective is to determine the magnitude and direction of turnover’s effect on operating perfor- mance in settings characterized by knowledge exploita- tion. Prior research on this question has offered mixed conclusions based on both theoretical and empirical analysis. For example, while many have argued that turnover has negative effects on operating performance due to the disruption of existing routines (Dalton and Todor 1979, Bluedorn 1982) or the loss of an employee’s accumulated experience (Argote and Epple 1990, Nelson and Winter 1982, Polanyi 1966), others have suggested that ﬁrms may beneﬁt from the innovative thinking or increased motivation that new workers bring to a job (Abelson and Baysinger 1984, Mowday et al. 1982, Staw 1980). These conﬂicting views suggest that the effect of turnover on performance may depend on the nature of the environment in which turnover occurs. Our second objective is to examine whether managers can mitigate the effect of turnover on operating perfor- mance. This question is particularly relevant for settings that operate with high levels of turnover. The aspect of management in which we are most interested is pro- cess conformance—the extent to which managers aim to 56 . ) s ( r o h t u a e h t o t y s e t r u o c . / g r o . s m r o f n i . s a n r u o j / / : p t t h l t a a s a l e b a y p o c l i a v a i s h t t d e u b i r t s d i d n a l e c i t r a i s h t o t s i , s e c i i l o p i n o s s m r e p i d n a s t h g i r i g n d u c n l i , n o i t t h g i r y p o c l s d o h a m r o n f i S M R O F N I l a n o i t i d d A Ton and Huckman: Managing the Impact of Employee Turnover on Performance Organization Science 19(1), pp. 56–68, © 2008 INFORMS 57 reduce variation in store operations in accordance with a set of prescribed standards for task performance. Our study design takes advantage of the fact that we are able to examine longitudinal observations of store- level performance across sites that are owned and oper- ated by the same parent company. We are thus able to control for ﬁrm-level characteristics (e.g., employment policies, training procedures, etc.) that may otherwise confound a multiﬁrm analysis of turnover’s impact on performance. As part of their common ownership, all of the stores in this chain are instructed to follow the same standards for task performance. The extent to which store managers enforce these standards, however, varies across sites. We take advantage of this variation in the degree of process conformance across otherwise simi- lar stores to examine the extent to which the impact of turnover can be managed. Using data from 268 stores over 48 months, we show that, on average, turnover is associated with decreased store performance, as measured by proﬁt margin and customer service. These average effects are not large. We also show that turnover has a nonlinear effect on per- formance, with low-turnover stores being more affected by turnover than high-turnover stores. Finally, we ﬁnd that, at high-process-conformance stores, turnover does not decrease store performance, whereas at low- process-conformance stores, turnover does decrease store performance. This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the theoretical motivation for our hypotheses. Section 3 describes the empirical setting, data and measures, and empirical models. Section 4 presents and discusses our results, and §5 concludes. 2. Theoretical Motivation As mentioned above, the prior literature on the effects of turnover provides a mixed picture in terms of both theory and empirical results. Several studies suggest that turnover decreases operating performance. While rec- ognizing the possibility of an optimal rate of turnover, Huselid (1995) assumes that low rates of turnover are preferable to high rates. Glebbeek and Bax (2004) refer to Huselid’s claim as the “conventional assumption of turnover research” (p. 279). Much of this negative effect stems from the direct costs of turnover, such as those involved with severance and the recruitment and training of new employees (Staw 1980, Darmon 1990, Hom and Griffeth 1995). In addi- tion, turnover has been associated with several indirect costs. First, ﬁrms may experience operational disrup- tion (Staw 1980, Mobley 1982) following the depar- ture of key employees. This could be due to either the loss of the ﬁrm-speciﬁc human capital that resides in departing employees (Becker 1962) or the loss of the social capital embedded in workers’ relationships to each other and the organization (Leana and Van Buren 1999, Dess and Shaw 2001). A second source of indirect costs is the demoralization of employees who remain with a ﬁrm (Staw 1980, Steers and Mowday 1981, Mobley 1982). This demoralization may be due to the loss of a respected colleague or the fact that turnover may require additional work to be absorbed by remaining employ- ees whose capacity is already stretched (Mowday et al. 1982). Despite substantial evidence regarding turnover’s neg- ative consequences for ﬁrms, several studies—including many of those above—note offsetting positive effects. For example, the economic perspective on turnover sug- gests that turnover reﬂects the beneﬁcial aspects of worker mobility, such as the improvement of matches between employees and ﬁrms over time (Jovanovic 1979). Organizational psychologists have also claimed that workers’ efforts may be highest when they ﬁrst join an organization and may decrease over time (Staw 1980). These conﬂicting views concerning the effects of turnover suggest that one must not view turnover as a monolithic concept, but rather as a contingent phenomenon. The relevant question thus becomes not whether turnover has positive or negative effects on performance, but rather under what conditions it is more harmful or beneﬁcial to the ﬁrm (Osterman 1987). Numerous studies have examined the dimensions along which turnover’s impact on performance may vary. These dimensions include the absolute level of turnover itself (Bluedorn 1982, Abelson and Baysinger 1984), the degree to which the departing employee is respected by his colleagues who remain with the ﬁrm (Mowday et al. 1982), the departing employee’s tenure with the ﬁrm (Staw 1980), the degree to which turnover is vol- untary for the worker (Bluedorn 1982), the degree to which turnover is predictable (Price 1977, Staw 1980), and the organizational structure of the ﬁrm in which turnover occurs (Carley 1992, Argote 1999, Rao and Argote 2006). One of the most commonly noted moderators of turnover’s effect on performance is the nature of the task being performed. Most studies considering the mod- erating role of task characteristics draw on some vari- ant of the distinction that is clearly stated in March’s (1991) comparison: “between the exploration of new possibilities and the exploitation of old certainties” (p. 71, emphasis added). March suggests that, in situa- tions involving exploration, the addition of novice work- ers may actually increase knowledge levels within the ﬁrm—not because of the expertise of these new workers, but rather because of the increased variety of perspec- tives they introduce to the organization. Several studies provide support for the beneﬁts of turnover in settings requiring exploration or innovation. Dalton and Todor (1979) and Staw (1980) note that the worker mobility implied by turnover may serve as . ) s ( r o h t u a e h t o t y s e t r u o c . / g r o . s m r o f n i . s a n r u o j / / : p t t h l t a a s a l e b a y p o c l i a v a i s h t t d e u b i r t s d i d n a l e c i t r a i s h t o t s i , s e c i i l o p i n o s s m r e p i d n a s t h g i r i g n d u c n l i , n o i t t h g i r y p o c l s d o h a m r o n f i S M R O F N I l a n o i t i d d A 58 Ton and Huckman: Managing the Impact of Employee Turnover on Performance Organization Science 19(1), pp. 56–68, © 2008 INFORMS a source of new knowledge for ﬁrms. Furthermore, an experimental study by Argote et al. (1995) ﬁnds that, although the average effect of turnover on work group performance is negative, this effect is less pronounced for complex tasks than for simple tasks. They attribute this difference in turnover’s effect to the fact that the per- formance of complex tasks requires greater innovation (i.e., exploration) than simpler tasks requiring repetition (i.e., exploitation). We maintain that performance in retail chain settings, such as the setting considered in this study, is more accurately characterized as requiring exploitation than exploration. We refer to March’s choice of terms to describe exploitation (e.g., reﬁnement, production, efﬁ- ciency, implementation, execution) versus exploration (e.g., search, variation, risk taking, experimentation, discovery, innovation) (March 1991). As Winter and Szulanski (2001) also argue, companies that operate multiple units often evolve from a phase of exploration during which they experiment with different approaches, to a phase of exploitation during which they “freeze the design” and replicate the established approaches. As a result, the performance at mature retail chains is highly dependent on the successful execution of known activi- ties such as processing of incoming inventory, shelving merchandise, responding to customer queries, and trans- acting sales on the cash registers. In this environment, we expect employee turnover to have a negative effect on ﬁrm performance due to oper- ational disruption from employee departures, additional work that must be absorbed by remaining employees, and the loss of tacit knowledge and accumulated experi- ence held by departing employees. While activities such as shelving merchandise may beneﬁt from increased effort of new employees, we expect this positive effect to be outweighed by the negative effects of turnover. Based on this characterization and the prior literature, we arrive at our ﬁrst hypothesis: Hypothesis 1. In settings requiring high levels of knowledge exploitation, turnover will, on average, have a negative effect on operating performance. To the extent that the hypothesized negative effect of turnover on operating performance in exploitation- based settings exists, we are interested in understand- ing the tools that managers might use to mitigate these effects. Below, we argue that one management lever in this regard is process conformance—the degree to which managers aim to reduce variation in operations in accor- dance with a set of prescribed standards for task perfor- mance. This concept is similar to notions of attention to detail and adherence to rules and procedures (Naveh and Erez 2004). Several researchers claim that a process con- formance approach may be appropriate in settings that produce standardized products or services (Levitt 1972, Bowen and Lawler 1992, Adler and Cole 1993, Sitkin et al. 1994, Bowen and Lawler 1995, Adler et al. 1999). In support of the role of process conformance in mit- igating turnover’s effect on performance, Argote and Epple (1990) state that “turnover may matter more in organizations where jobs are not standardized and pro- cedures do not exist for transmitting knowledge to new members” (p. 922). In motivating our second hypothesis, we note that this quote uses the word “may,” suggest- ing that the role of such standardization in mitigating turnover’s negative effects merits empirical examination. We also stress a point that is important to our analysis, though not addressed in the above quote—that standard- ization is a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition for process conformance. In our setting, the level of stan- dardization as designated by the corporate ofﬁce is the same at all 268 stores, each of which is instructed to follow the policies and procedures described in the 334- page corporate manual. Because the chain uses central- ized planning, compliance with standards is important from the perspective of the corporate ofﬁce. The extent to which store managers enforce these standards, how- ever, differs considerably across sites. While some store managers are quite disciplined in implementing these prescribed standards (high-process-conformance stores) others are more tolerant of deviations from these stan- dards (low-process-conformance stores). In our retail setting, to the extent that stores operate with a high degree of process conformance, we expect that knowledge concerning task performance will be transferred more easily to new employees (i.e., it will be less likely to be lost when employees depart). This expectation leads to our second hypothesis: Hypothesis 2. In settings requiring high levels of the level of process confor- knowledge exploitation, mance will moderate the impact of turnover on operat- ing performance. In particular, stores with lower levels of process conformance will be more negatively affected by turnover than stores with higher levels of process conformance. 3. Research Design 3.1. Empirical Setting We test our hypotheses using data from Borders Group (Borders), a Fortune 500 retailer of entertainment prod- ucts such as books, CDs, and DVDs. At the end of 2003, Borders operated 445 superstores (under the name Bor- ders) and about 720 mall-based stores (under the name Waldenbooks), and employed approximately 32,000 peo- ple. In this study, we focus solely on Borders super- stores (hereafter called Borders stores). Like most retail- ers, Borders stores experience high levels of employee turnover. Between 1999 and 2002, the average annual full-time employee turnover across Borders stores ranged from 49% to 69%, and the average annual part-time employee turnover ranged from 94% to 114%. Ton and Huckman: Managing the Impact of Employee Turnover on Performance Organization Science 19(1), pp. 56–68, © 2008 INFORMS 59 . ) s ( r o h t u a e h t o t y s e t r u o c . / g r o . s m r o f n i . s a n r u o j / / : p t t h l t a a s a l e b a y p o c l i a v a i s h t t d e u b i r t s d i d n a l e c i t r a i s h t o t s i , s e c i i l o p i n o s s m r e p i d n a s t h g i r i g n d u c n l i , n o i t t h g i r y p o c l s d o h a m r o n f i S M R O F N I l a n o i t i d d A Borders stores provide an ideal setting in which to examine whether the impact of turnover on performance can be moderated by process conformance. Because Borders uses centralized merchandise planning, it has developed standard operating procedures across all of its stores. This standardization supports customer ser- vice efforts at the store level. For example, computer terminals at Borders stores allow customers to check the availability and location of speciﬁc books. The success of this system depends on books being shelved in spe- ciﬁc sections, as prescribed by the corporate standards. The shelving standards, as well as other standard oper- ating procedures, are described in a 334-page policy and process handbook. Although all stores are instructed to conform to these standards, we observed during our store visits that the extent of conformance varies across sites. While some store managers impose discipline in con- forming to prescribed standards, others tolerate devia- tions. For example, at one store, in violation of shelving standards salespeople organized art books by artist rather than by author. The manager of that store noted we don’t shelve art books like other Borders stores do. Our salespeople are extremely brainy. Other stores don’t shelve by artist, they shelve by author. Like some of titles up there, I don’t know which artists they are and look in the computer, and it’s like a Degas book, and I wouldn’t know that by looking at it, but the salespeople know. So they put titles with Degas that don’t have the word “Degas” in the name. They do that with biographies as well. If a biography doesn’t have a name of a person they will know that and say, “Hey, this is a biography about this person. I’m going to shelve it with this per- son’s work.” At another store, salespeople placed overstocked books underneath display tables on the selling ﬂoor instead of placing them in appropriate storage areas. Similar to the above example, the store manager was well aware of this violation and even encouraged it, as she thought it saved her salespeople time in restocking shelves. This approach, however, was not consistent across stores. In fact, we asked another store manager why he did not encourage his employees to deviate from shelving standards when they disagreed with them. He replied, “That’s exactly how books get lost at a store.” In a related vein, a ﬁve-year employee at another store told us that, while she often did not agree with the shelving standards, it was clear to her that she was expected to follow them. While picking up the new merchandise that arrived at the store, she pointed at two books that were related to the bestselling book The Da Vinci Code, and observed this one goes to “Christianity,” but this one is in “meta- physical.” See, that’s another dumb thing. We don’t keep them together in sections. This is not our thinking, but this is what we are asked to do. The label says Christian- ity, so I’ll put it in Christianity. 3.2. Data and Measures Our sample includes data from all 268 Borders stores that opened before August 1999. We obtained monthly turnover and performance data for each store from 1999 to 2002. Below, we describe our measures of store per- formance, employee turnover, and process conformance. We then describe our empirical analysis and the asso- ciated control variables. Summary statistics and simple correlations among all variables used in our analysis are provided in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. We note that Table 2 should be interpreted with caution, as it uses pooled observations from the 268 sites across 48 time periods. 3.2.1. Store Performance. We examine turnover’s effect on two measures of store performance. The ﬁrst, customer service score, is a subjective measure. Each store is shopped once a month by a mystery shopper. These shoppers ﬁll out a form that includes approxi- mately 50 questions about the store environment and customer service interactions.2 A store’s overall customer service score is based on the mystery shopper’s answers to these questions. Our second performance measure, proﬁt margin (operating income divided by sales), is an objective measure of ﬁnancial performance. We prefer this measure to other measures of ﬁnancial performance, such as total sales or total proﬁt, as these latter measures are affected by the absolute level of activity at the store. In many instances, the absolute level of activity depends on factors that are beyond the control of the store manager, such as weather conditions, corporate promotions, author sign- ings, or idiosyncratic special events. Because it is dif- ﬁcult to account for the impact of all of these external factors, we use proﬁt margin as a performance measure that controls for differences in the absolute level of activ- ity across stores.

Employee Turnover. Employees voluntarily leave Borders stores for a variety of reasons including career changes, geographical moves, pursuit of educa- tional opportunities, or retirement. As shown in Figure 1, across all Borders stores, employee turnover tends to be highest during the month of August due to employees’ leaving Borders to return to school. Given the nature of the performance measures we observe, we focus on turnover of employees who per- form day-to-day operational activities at the stores and exclude employees who are engaged in ofﬁce coordi- nation or community relations activities. In addition, we focus solely on permanent employees. Like most retailers, Borders hires temporary employees during high-trafﬁc periods (e.g., holiday shopping in Decem- ber). These temporary employees are excluded in our In addition, Borders reports employees’ measures.3 departures only when they leave the company perma- nently. Consequently, our turnover measures do not track store transfers. Finally, we note that most turnover at Borders stores is voluntary. Though we would have liked to distinguish between voluntary and involuntary turnover, we were not able to obtain the data required to make such distinctions. We calculate the turnover rate in a particular period as the number of employees who left a store during that period divided by the average number of employees working at the store during that period. While there are several other methods for calculating employee turnover (Mobley 1982, Price 1977), our measure is widely used and allows for comparability to earlier ﬁndings (Price 1977, Glebbeek and Bax 2004, Shaw et al. 2005). As shown in Table 1, average monthly full-time turnover in our sample is 4.4%, while average monthly part-time turnover is 7.5%. 3.2.3. Process Conformance. To assess the level of process conformance at stores, we use two measures that are regularly tracked by Borders management. The ﬁrst measure, internally called store conditions, is taken quarterly and measures conformance to a wide range of processes. The second measure, internally called returns pull list, or RPL, is taken monthly and measures confor- mance to a speciﬁc process. Below we describe each of the measures and explain how we use them to create a composite measure of process conformance. 3.2.4. Store Conditions. Borders classiﬁes its stores into different regions, each of which is led by a regional manager. Regional managers regularly make store vis- its to assess the performance of stores and to set goals for store managers. Once a quarter, each store’s regional manager also performs a thorough inspection of its con- formance to a wide range of processes. The inspec- tion covers four categories: books, café, music and video, and store operations. Each category is divided into multiple sections. For example, the book category is divided into ﬁve sections: alphabetization, shelf orga- nization, endcaps, overstock, and product ﬂow. Each of these sections is further divided into different items. The alphabetization section, for example, includes overall alphabetization, category-critical alphabetization, biog- raphy alphabetization, and alphabetization when an author has multiple books. . ) s ( r o h t u a e h t o t y s e t r u o c . / g r o . s m r o f n i . s a n r u o j / / : p t t h l t a a s a l e b a y p o c l i a v a i s h t t d e u b i r t s d i d n a l e c i t r a i s h t o t s i , s e c i i l o p i n o s s m r e p i d n a s t h g i r i g n d u c n l i , n o i t t h g i r y p o c l s d o h a m r o n f i S M R O F N I l a n o i t i d d A Ton and Huckman: Managing the Impact of Employee Turnover on Performance Organization Science 19(1), pp. 56–68, © 2008 INFORMS 61 Figure 1 Full-Time and Part-Time Employee Turnover at Borders, 1999–2002 15 13 11 9 7 5 ) % (   r e v o n r u t   e e y o p m E l 3 Feb-99 Part-time turnover Full-time turnover M ay-99 Aug-99 Nov-99 Feb-00 M ay-00 Aug-00 Nov-00 Feb-01 M ay-01 Aug-01 Nov-01 Feb-02 M ay-02 Aug-02 Nov-02 Time Stores receive a score for each of the items.

Speciﬁc section scores are ﬁrst multiplied by a weighting scale and then added up to create the total store conditions score. 3.2.5. Returns Pull List. The second component of our composite measure of process conformance is a store’s RPL score. In this setting, retailers are allowed to return unsold books to the publishers for a full refund minus the costs of shipping and handling. Processing returns is a major task at Borders stores: a typical store returns approximately 110,000 units, or 40% of its inventory, every year. At the beginning of each month, Borders’s corporate ofﬁce sends a returns list to each store. The standard operating procedures require stores to return all books on the list to the retailer’s distribu- tion centers by the end of the month. At the end of each returns period, the stores receive a returns conformance score (internally called an RPL score), based on the number of units returned divided by the total number of units that were supposed to be returned. The returns pro- cess, described in detail in the policy and process book, involves ﬁnding the books, packing them, and shipping them to the distribution centers. RPL scores do not affect stores’ short-term ﬁnancial performance because inventory management is central- ized at Borders. Because stores do not pay for the books they carry, they do not receive a payment when they return the books. In addition, RPL performance is not used by corporate management to evaluate store man- ager performance. Consequently, maximizing the RPL score is not necessarily a high priority for store man- agers. Precisely because RPL is not a high priority, it reﬂects the degree to which store managers place empha- sis on process conformance. In this sense, RPL is similar to activities such as preventative machine maintenance in manufacturing plants. Preventative maintenance often is neither tracked nor used to evaluate plant perfor- mance, nor used to compensate plant managers. It does, however, reﬂect managerial attention to process con- formance; managers who place the greatest emphasis on process conformance are likely to ensure that pre- ventative maintenance is performed as scheduled, while those who are less concerned with process conformance may sacriﬁce preventative maintenance for other press- ing tasks at like preventative maintenance, although returning books does not have an immediate effect on performance, it may have a longer- term and indirect effect on store performance. Removing books that do not sell well from the selling ﬂoor allows stores to use the limited shelf space for books that sell better, presumably leading to higher sales. the plant. In addition, 3.2.6. Composite Measure of Process Conformance. To develop our composite measure of process con- formance, we use the average store conditions score and the average RPL score for each store for each year.4 Using these scores, we calculate the mean and standard deviation of store conditions and RPL scores across all Borders stores for each year. For each store, we then standardize the yearly store conditions and RPL scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. We combine these standardized scores to create the composite process conformance measure. Using this measure, we rank stores and divide them into high-process-conformance and low-process- conformance stores. We use these two categories— rather than using process conformance as a continuous variable—to account for the fact that process confor- mance is a proxy for high and low levels of process conformance rather than a precise measure of this under- lying variable. As such, we are reluctant to suggest that . ) s ( r o h t u a e h t o t y s e t r u o c . / g r o . s m r o f n i . s a n r u o j / / : p t t h l t a a s a l e b a y p o c l i a v a i s h t t d e u b i r t s d i d n a l e c i t r a i s h t o t s i , s e c i i l o p i n o s s m r e p i d n a s t h g i r i g n d u c n l i , n o i t t h g i r y p o c l s d o h a m r o n f i S M R O F N I l a n o i t i d d A 62 Ton and Huckman: Managing the Impact of Employee Turnover on Performance Organization Science 19(1), pp. 56–68, © 2008 INFORMS small variations in process conformance scores repre- sent a meaningfully different level of process confor- mance. Furthermore, our simple categorization simpli- ﬁes the interpretation of our empirical results. 3.3. Empirical Model We estimate the following equation using ordinary least squares (OLS) to test for the effect of employee turnover on various dimensions of store performance: Performanceimy = (cid:1)i + (cid:3)y + (cid:5)m + (cid:7)1 Employee Turnoverimy + Ximy(cid:7)2 + (cid:9)imy(cid:10) (1) We estimate versions of (1) using several different mea- sures of employee turnover. In our initial model, we use separate variables for part-time and full-time turnover. Given the similarity between the tasks performed by these two types of employees in this setting, we also estimate (1) using a single turnover measure for both types of workers, which we refer to as total turnover. Regardless of whether we split or combine full- and part-time turnover, we measure each value in two ways. First, we measure turnover over the one-month period ranging from the 15th day of the prior month to the 15th day of the current month. We use this time period due to the uncertainty surrounding the speed with which one would expect turnover to affect performance. Using turnover lagged by one month may be misleading if the effects of turnover occur immediately. Alternatively, using turnover in the current month would be problem- atic if performance effects occur with a lag. We use our measure as a compromise between these two extremes. To address concerns about the potential noise in monthly levels of turnover, we also estimate our models using a measure of turnover during the prior three months. In addition to employee turnover, (1) includes a vec- tor, Ximy, that contains several store-level variables that vary over time. These include an indicator for turnover by store managers during the current month (to con- trol for management changes);5 full-time employees as a percentage of total employees (to control for employee mix); total store payroll (to control for the total amount of labor used by the store); the number of competitors in the local market;6 and the unemployment rate in the store’s metropolitan statistical area (to control for labor supply).7 We would have liked to control for average employee tenure at the store. We were not able, however, to obtain these data from the company. This speciﬁcation also includes ﬁxed effects for each store (cid:11)(cid:1)i(cid:12), each year (cid:11)(cid:3)y(cid:12) from 1999 to 2002, and each month (cid:11)(cid:5)m(cid:12) of the calendar year. Store ﬁxed effects con- trol for time-invariant, unobserved heterogeneity across stores8 (Hausman and Taylor 1981), which might oth- erwise affect both employee turnover and store perfor- mance, leading to biased estimates. The year effects control for changes over time in factors such as eco- nomic conditions and corporate policies, while the calendar-month effects control for seasonality. To make sure that turnover is not endogenous to per- formance, we asked store managers, store employees, and corporate managers what drives turnover at Borders stores. None of the managers we interviewed mentioned poor store performance as a driver of employee turnover. Furthermore, they noted that involuntary turnover due to the poor performance of individual employees is quite rare. Finally, several of our empirical models use lagged measures of turnover to reduce concerns of endo- geneity. Nevertheless, to test whether employee turnover remains endogenous, we examine the effect of past store performance on employee turnover. We use one-month and two-month lags for both customer service and proﬁt margin. The results, not reported in our paper, show no evidence of signiﬁcant effect of either measure of store performance on employee turnover. The absence of sig- niﬁcant effects in the reverse regressions is reassuring, and suggests that we need not be overly concerned about the exogeneity of our turnover measure. Several have hypothesized that the relationship between employee turnover and performance is nonlin- ear (Price 1977, Bluedorn 1982). To determine whether the effect of turnover on performance depends on the level of turnover at the stores, we estimate models in which we interact monthly turnover with two categories for the average level of turnover—high and low—at the stores. This model appears below: Performanceimy = (cid:1)i + (cid:3)y + (cid:5)m + (cid:7)1 Employee Turnoverimy + (cid:7)2 Employee Turnoverimy ∗ High TurnoverimyXimy(cid:7)4 + (cid:9)imy(cid:10) (2) The high- and low-turnover categories were assigned by ranking and dividing the stores into halves based on their turnover in each year. We also estimate versions of (2) where we divide stores into three categories based on their yearly turnover performance—high, medium, and low. The results (not reported in this paper) are very similar to those using two categories. Finally, to determine whether process conformance moderates the relationship between turnover and per- formance, we estimate models in which the level of employee turnover is interacted with the two categories of process conformance—high and low. This model appears below: Performanceimy = (cid:1)i + (cid:3)y + (cid:5)m + (cid:7)1 Employee Turnoverimy + (cid:7)2 Employee Turnoverimy ∗High Process Conformanceiy+Ximy(cid:7)4+(cid:9)imy(cid:10) (3) . ) s ( r o h t u a e h t o t y s e t r u o c . / g r o . s m r o f n i . s a n r u o j / / : p t t h l t a a s a l e b a y p o c l i a v a i s h t t d e u b i r t s d i d n a l e c i t r a i s h t o t s i , s e c i i l o p i n o s s m r e p i d n a s t h g i r i g n d u c n l i , n o i t t h g i r y p o c l s d o h a m r o n f i S M R O F N I l a n o i t i d d A Ton and Huckman: Managing the Impact of Employee Turnover on Performance Organization Science 19(1), pp. 56–68, © 2008 INFORMS 63 As a test of robustness, we also estimate a version of (3) where we divide stores into three categories based on their yearly process conformance performance—high, medium, and low. In addition, we also estimate versions of (3) where we use yearly RPL scores, yearly store con- ditions scores, and variations in RPL as single measures of process conformance.9 4. Results and Discussion 4.1. Average Effect of Turnover on Performance 4.1.1. Customer Service. Table 3 presents the esti- mates for our basic model with customer service score as the dependent variable. Columns 1 and 2 suggest that, on average, monthly turnover has a negative, but insigniﬁ- cant, impact on customer service. When turnover is mea- sured over the prior three months, however, the effects remain negative and are signiﬁcant at conventional levels (Columns 3 and 4). In terms of magnitude, these effects Table 3 Regressions Testing the Average Effect of Employee Turnover on Customer Service Score (Standard Errors Shown in Parentheses) Variable 1 2 3 4 Dependent variable: Customer service score are not large—an increase of one-standard deviation10 in full-time turnover and part-time turnover at an aver- age store lead to reductions of 0.33 and 0.20 points in customer service scores, respectively (0.4% and 0.2% relative to the average score of 85.1 points). Using total turnover, the impact of an increase of one standard devi- ation is a reduction of 0.39 points (0.5% relative to the average score). rates suggest an insigniﬁcant 4.1.2. Proﬁt Margin. Table 4 provides analogous results for regressions in which proﬁt margin is the dependent variable. Again, the results using one-month turnover relationship between turnover and performance (Columns 1 and 2). Using turnover rates for the prior three months, we again ﬁnd negative and signiﬁcant effects of turnover on per- formance. An increase of one standard deviation in full- time turnover at an average store leads to reductions of 0.2 percentage points in proﬁt margin (2.72% rel- ative to the average value of 7.44%).

This seemingly modest negative effect on proﬁt margin, however, is economically signiﬁcant for the company. A loss of $11,700 proﬁt per store amounts to a total loss of $3.1 million for 268 stores, or approximately 6% of the net income that came from Borders stores in 1999.11 Although our ﬁndings are sensitive to the length of time over which turnover is observed, the results from Tables 3 and 4 provide some support for Hypothesis 1. Using turnover rates for the prior three months, on aver- age, turnover has a negative effect on both measures of store performance. We note that the results using sepa- rate measures of full- and part-time turnover and a single measure of total turnover are very similar.

Using customer service as the dependent variable, high-turnover stores show an effect of turnover that is 8.1 points greater than the effect for low-turnover stores using monthly mea- sures of turnover. The combined effect of turnover of 4.33 (=−3(cid:10)72 + 8(cid:10)05) for high-turnover stores is not signiﬁcantly different from zero. Similarly, using proﬁt margin as the dependent variable, high-turnover stores show effects of turnover that are 0.06 and 0.02 percent- age points greater than the effect for low-turnover stores using monthly and three-month measures of turnover, respectively. Again, the combined effects of turnover for high-turnover stores are not signiﬁcantly different from zero. Overall, our results show that the effect of turnover on performance is worse for low-turnover stores than for high-turnover stores. This is consistent with Price’s (1977) prediction and a recent empirical study of turnover in the trucking and concrete pipe industries (Shaw et al. 2005). 4.3. Moderating Effect of Process Conformance Table 6 presents estimates of (3) with customer service and proﬁt margin as the dependent variable.12 Regardless of whether we use customer service (Columns 1 and 2) or proﬁt margin (Columns 3 and 4) as the performance variable, our results are similar. The effect of turnover for low-process conformance stores is negative and sig- niﬁcant. This negative effect is offset as we move to stores with high levels of process conformance. Using both monthly and three-month measures of turnover, the effects for high-process conformance stores are signif- icantly higher than those for low-process conformance stores. The combined effects for the high- conformance group are not signiﬁcantly different from zero in any of the four columns. For example, when using monthly turnover, and examining the effect of turnover on cus- tomer service, for high-process conformance stores of 4.431 (=−7(cid:10)777 + 12(cid:10)208) in Column 1 is not signiﬁcantly different from zero. Note that we obtained very similar results when we divided stores into high-, medium-, and low-process conformance categories. the combined effect of turnover In Table 7, we report results in which we replace our composite measure of process conformance with three separate measures of process conformance—high yearly RPL scores, high yearly store conditions scores, and high variation in RPL. The ﬁrst two measures were cre- ated by ranking stores with respect to their yearly RPL and yearly store condition scores and dividing them into high- and low-RPL and high- and low-store conditions categories, respectively. Regardless of whether we use high-RPL or high-store conditions, we obtain similar results. The effect of turnover on both customer service and proﬁt margin for stores that are in low categories is . ) s ( r o h t u a e h t o t y s e t r u o c . / g r o . s m r o f n i . s a n r u o j / / : p t t h l t a a s a l e b a y p o c l i a v a i s h t t d e u b i r t s d i d n a l e c i t r a i s h t o t s i , s e c i i l o p i n o s s m r e p i d n a s t h g i r i g n d u c n l i , n o i t t h g i r y p o c l s d o h a m r o n f i S M R O F N I l a n o i t i d d A Ton and Huckman: Managing the Impact of Employee Turnover on Performance Organization Science 19(1), pp. 56–68, © 2008 INFORMS 65 Table 6 Regressions Testing Process Conformance as a Moderator of Turnover’s Effect on Customer Service Score and Proﬁt Margin (Standard Errors in Parentheses) Dependent variable: Customer service Dependent variable: Proﬁt margin 1 Variable Percent of total turnover −7(cid:3)777∗∗ (cid:5)3(cid:3)257(cid:6) 12(cid:3)208∗∗∗ (cid:5)3(cid:3)803(cid:6) Percent of Total turnover ∗ High conformance Percent of total turnover 3 −0(cid:3)031∗∗ (cid:5)0(cid:3)014(cid:6) 0(cid:3)056∗∗∗ (cid:5)0(cid:3)021(cid:6) 2 −6(cid:3)262∗∗∗ (cid:5)1(cid:3)865(cid:6) 5(cid:3)088∗∗∗ (cid:5)1(cid:3)993(cid:6) (3 months) Percent of total turnover (3 months) ∗ High conformance Any manager turnover during period?

This negative effect is offset as we move to stores in the high categories. These similar results with models based on the individual components of our composite measure provide support for our main ﬁndings. We add the third measure—high variation in RPL— under the assumption that stores with high levels of pro- cess conformance will be characterized not only by high RPL levels but also by low variation in RPL levels across time. We divide stores into high- and low-variation RPL categories using the standard deviation of their monthly RPL scores in a year. As reported in Columns 3 and 6 of Table 7, the effect of turnover for stores in the low- variation RPL category is negative and signiﬁcant. This negative effect is even more pronounced for stores that are in the high-variation RPL category, supporting our hypothesis that the effect of turnover is worse for low- conformance stores. 5. Conclusion The ﬁrst objective of this study is to examine the effect of turnover on operating performance in settings that require high levels of knowledge exploitation (March 1991). Our longitudinal analysis of Borders stores shows that, on average, increased employee turnover is asso- ciated with decreased store performance, as measured by customer service score and proﬁt margin. Consis- tent with Price (1977), we also ﬁnd that turnover has a nonlinear effect on performance, with low-turnover stores being more affected by turnover than their high-turnover counterparts. At low-turnover stores, the average employee has a high level of accumulated expe- rience. Consequently, an employee’s departure would be expected to have a large effect on performance because the store loses an employee with substantial experience. At high-turnover stores, however, the average employee has a lower level of accumulated experience. As such, employee turnover would be expected to have a smaller effect on store performance because turnover simply replaces one inexperienced employee with another. The second objective of our work is to contribute to the study of employee turnover as a contingent phe- nomenon. Our analysis shows that the effect of turnover on operating performance is mitigated by the nature of store management. Speciﬁcally, the negative effect of turnover on performance is more pronounced at stores where managers choose a low-process-conformance approach. For example, an increase of one standard devi- ation in total turnover at a low-process-conformance store leads to a 3.8% decrease in proﬁt margin. However, at high-process-conformance stores, where employees consistently follow prescribed standard operating proce- dures, increasing turnover does not lead to a decrease in store performance. We claim that, at high-process-conformance stores, there is a consistent approach to task performance and, as a result, knowledge resides in existing routines (Nelson and Winter 1982) at those sites. It is, therefore, easier to transfer knowledge to new employees, and the disruption of existing routines following an employee departure is small (Argote 1999). At low-process-conformance stores, however, there is greater variation across employ- ees in how tasks are performed. As a result, knowledge resides in employees rather than in organizational rou- tines. The knowledge of these workers is thus likely to be lost when they leave the ﬁrm. Our study has implications for managing knowl- edge in organizations. Our ﬁndings suggest that stor- ing knowledge in organizational routines rather than in employees represents one approach to mitigating the negative consequences of turnover on organizational per- formance. This approach may be particularly effective in exploitation-oriented settings that experience high levels of turnover. Like most studies of this type, ours is not without its caveats. First, we examine a single ﬁrm in a single industry. As a result, our ﬁndings may not generalize to other settings, even those characterized by similar levels of knowledge exploitation. Nonetheless, our focus on a 66 Ton and Huckman: Managing the Impact of Employee Turnover on Performance Organization Science 19(1), pp. 56–68, © 2008 INFORMS Table 7 Regressions Testing Various Measures of Process Conformance as Moderators of Turnover’s Effect on Customer Service Score and Proﬁt Margin (Standard Errors in Parentheses) Variable Percent of total turnover (3 months) ∗ High store conditions Percent of total turnover (3 months) Percent of Total turnover (3 months)∗ High RPL Percent of total turnover (3 months) ∗ High RPL variation Any manager turnover during period?

We thus avoid having to control for unobservable ﬁrm-level factors that are correlated with both performance and turnover. Fur- thermore, our ﬁndings may be applied to other forms of retailing as well as to other settings—such as call cen- ters, hospitals, and food services—that operate with high levels of employee turnover. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2005a), employee turnover rates in the retail industry and in the accommodation and food services industries were 55.1% and 75.4%, respectively, in 2005.13 These turnover rates include turnover of all employees (e.g., workers who perform daily operational activities as well as managers and assistant managers). Turnover rates for workers who perform operational activities are likely to be even higher. At many fast-food chains, for example, employee turnover rates of 200% a year for hourly workers are common (White 2005). Fur- thermore, workers performing daily operational activi- ties in these industries represent a signiﬁcant portion of the workforce in the United States.14 Second, we cannot distinguish between voluntary and involuntary turnover. Borders managers maintain that most turnover at their stores is voluntary and, as a result, they do not systematically track the causes of turnover for store employees. To the extent that involuntary turnover and process conformance are correlated, the moderating effect of process conformance may be partly due to the involuntary nature of turnover at these stores. Although we do not have any reason to believe that there is more involuntary turnover at high-process-conformance stores, we are not able to test this relationship with our data. Third, our data do not allow us to determine whether a store’s level of process conformance is the result of man- agerial policy or employee will. For example, we are not able to observe whether a store has low process confor- mance because its manager decides not to enforce corpo- rate standards or because its frontline employees decide not to act in accordance with mandates from the store manager. Regardless of the underlying cause of low con- formance, our study highlights the impact of its occur- rence on the effect that turnover has on performance. Fourth, it is possible that there is an alternative expla- nation of our results. Speciﬁcally, employees at stores with low process conformance may be more skilled in selling books and interacting with customers than they are in following standardized processes. Because these employees directly affect customer service, and thus sales and proﬁt, their departure may disproportionately hurt operational performance at stores with low process conformance. This explanation is unlikely in our setting. We ﬁnd that stores with high process conformance have . ) s ( r o h t u a e h t o t y s e t r u o c . / g r o . s m r o f n i . s a n r u o j / / : p t t h l t a a s a l e b a y p o c l i a v a i s h t t d e u b i r t s d i d n a l e c i t r a i s h t o t s i , s e c i i l o p i n o s s m r e p i d n a s t h g i r i g n d u c n l i , n o i t t h g i r y p o c l s d o h a m r o n f i S M R O F N I l a n o i t i d d A Ton and Huckman: Managing the Impact of Employee Turnover on Performance Organization Science 19(1), pp. 56–68, © 2008 INFORMS 67 higher average customer service scores than those with low process conformance (88.2 versus 86.6). This dif- ference of 1.6 points is statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level.15 As a result, our setting does not appear to be characterized by a trade-off between customer ser- vice and process conformance. Furthermore, we have no reason to believe that, at stores with low process conformance, employees who leave are more customer service and sales oriented than are those employees who stay. Although we are unable to observe individual employees’ inclinations toward process conformance or customer service, we expect some degree of similarity across employees within a store, especially given that hiring at a store is generally done by a single manager. Finally, it is not obvious that our ﬁndings translate to a more exploration-oriented setting in which there may exist a trade-off between process conformance and per- formance measures, such as customer service. In such settings, a push toward greater process conformance and standardization will likely limit process ﬂexibility; the theoretical effects of this trade-off on overall store or ﬁrm performance are not clear. As such, our ﬁndings are most applicable to exploitation-oriented settings (i.e., those settings in which the returns to having consistent and replicable processes are greater than those to having a high level of ﬂexibility). Despite these caveats, our study has important man- agerial implications. To reduce the costs associated with employee turnover, most recommend that managers focus on reducing the level of turnover. Here we sug- gest that, in certain settings, managers may also be able to reduce the turnover’s effect (regardless of its absolute level) by focusing on process management and the cre- ation of standard operating procedures. Our ﬁndings sug- gest that the current managerial and ﬁnancial resources dedicated to reducing the occurrence of turnover might be redirected, at least in part, to improving the ﬁrm’s ability to manage turnover’s impact.

Endnotes 1For example, see Sasha Corporation (2007) for a list of stud- ies that estimate the cost of turnover. 2Examples of questions relating to the customer service envi- ronment: • Was area outside the door and around the display win- dows clean and neat? • Were facilities in the restroom in working order? • Were bookshelves fully stocked, without gaps or the back of shelves showing? Examples of questions relating to customer service interac- tions: • Did any employee initiate verbal acknowledgment or greet you while you were in the store? • Was at least one employee visible and approachable at the information desk? • Did employees make additional item suggestions? 3We note that the distinction between permanent and tem- porary employees is not the same as that between full-time and part-time employees. Permanent employees are those who are employed for an unspeciﬁed duration; they are considered either full time or part time based on the number of hours they work each week. Temporary employees are hired for a speci- ﬁed period of time (e.g., one month). During that period, they may work in either a full- or part-time basis. 4We had access to monthly RPL scores. We were not able, however, to obtain quarterly store conditions scores. We were able to collect data only on average store conditions scores for each year. 5We also repeated our analysis using store manager turnover during the past three months. Although the magnitude of the store manager turnover coefﬁcient as well as its signiﬁcance changed slightly in different models, the direction remained the same. We do not report the results using this alternative measure of store manager turnover. 6Managers at Borders consider Barnes & Noble and other Bor- ders stores in the area as the main competitors to a speciﬁc Borders store. Consequently, Borders tracks the opening and closing of Barnes & Noble and other Borders stores near each existing Borders store. 7Unemployment data were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 8In this setting, these unobserved, time-invariant aspects of a store include factors such as physical size and layout. 9Variation in RPL scores was calculated using monthly RPL scores for each store. 10The standard deviation of three-month turnover using pooled observations from all cross sections and time periods is 0.109 for full-time employee turnover, 0.242 for part-time turnover, and 0.101 for total turnover. The standard deviation of three- month turnover within a store varies from 0.024 to 0.245 for full-time turnover, from 0.067 to 0.801 for part-time turnover, and from 0.033 to 0.27 for total employee turnover. In inter- preting our results, we use the standard deviation of turnover within an average store. 11In 1999, Borders Group’s net income was $90.3 million. Approximately 60% of the company’s sales came from Bor- ders stores. If we assume a similar share of the proﬁts, Bor- ders stores contributed to about $54 million in proﬁt. We note that the 2.72% decrease in a store’s proﬁt margin leads to a larger decrease in corporate net income as the former does not include part of the selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses (it includes store labor, which is reported under SG&A), it also does not include other investment expenses or taxes. 12Note that the number of observations dropped signiﬁcantly, as we were able to obtain only three years of data for store conditions. 68 Ton and Huckman: Managing the Impact of Employee Turnover on Performance Organization Science 19(1), pp. 56–68, © 2008 INFORMS 13The turnover rate is the number of total separations as a percent of total employment in these industries. 14According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (2005b), retail salespeople, cashiers, food preparation and serving workers (including waiters and waitresses), and cooks in fast-food chains accounted for 13.9 million employees, or about 10.6% of total employment in 2005. 15We do not observe a difference in average proﬁt margins between high-conformance and low-conformance stores.
