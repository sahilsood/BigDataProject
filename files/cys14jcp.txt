While each type of innovation has its own attri- butes, determinants, and contribution to business performance, it is not effective to implement eco- innovation programs without a holistic view. This study draws from the resource-based view theory to investigate inter-relationships among three types of eco-innovation (process, product, organizational) and their relative impact on business performance. Using structural equation modeling with 121 samples collected from Taiwan Environmental Management Association, we ﬁnd that eco-organizational inno- vation has the strongest effect on business performance. Additionally, eco-process and eco-product in- novations partially mediate the effects of eco-organizational innovation, and eco-product innovation mediates eco-process innovations’ effects on business performance. Business performance is directly and indirectly affected by eco-organizational, eco-process, and eco-product innovations. The ﬁndings suggest that, in order to develop effective eco-innovation programs, managers must understand the interde- pendence and co-evolutionary relationships between different types of eco-innovation. Overall, this study extends the discussion of innovation to the area of environmental innovation or eco-innovation. Ó 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Many organizations have advocated innovation programs per- taining to environmental management to effectively reduce waste and improve the utilization of scarce resources (Carrillo-Hermosilla et al., 2010). Kemp and Pearson (2008, p. 7) referred to those innovative programs in relation to environmental management as eco-innovation, which is deﬁned as “The production, assimilation or exploitation of a product, production process, service or manage- ment or business methods that is novel to the organization (developing or adopting it) and which results, throughout its life cycle, in a reduction of environmental risk, pollution and other negative impacts of resources used (including energy use) compared to relevant alternatives.” With the ever increasing pressure from the government and marketplace regarding manufacturing sustainability, developing an effective eco- innovation program and making it an integrative part of a ﬁrm’s * Corresponding author.

In practice, there are various types of eco-innovation (OECD and Eurostat, 2005, p. 16), including product innovations, process in- novations, organizational innovations and marketing innovations. While each type of innovation has its own attributes, determinants, and contribution to environmental performance (Christensen, 2011; Damanpour et al., 2009), researchers have cautioned that it is not effective to implement innovation programs separately without a systemic view (Damanpour et al., 2009; Chou et al., 2012; Xing et al., 2013). Nonetheless, previous studies have mostly focused on the development and performance of individual eco- innovation programs (e.g., Pujari, 2006; Anttonen et al., 2013), such as product service innovation (Maxwell et al., 2006), service innovation (Chou et al., 2012; Xing et al., 2013), technological innovation (Moore and Ausley, 2004; Tseng et al., 2013), and infrastructure and policy innovation (Rehfeld et al., 2007; Shin et al., 2008). Developing eco-innovation without a holistic view could be counter-productive. For instance, several researchers addressed eco-innovation issues from a purely technological perspective (e.g., Dangelico and Pujari, 2010; Weinberger et al., 2012). Socio- technical system theory argues that implementing innovations 82 C.C.J. Cheng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 64 (2014) 81e90 should be coupled with proper social and managerial systems in order to optimize business performance (Cummings and Srivastva, 1977). In addition, an organization must be able to adjust and ﬁne- tune its structure and internal activities to support technological aspects of eco-innovation (Lam, 2005). Brunnermeier and Cohen (2003) and Horbach (2008) also pointed out that an effective eco- innovation program should not be the sole responsibility of the R&D unit. Instead, an organization must take a holistic approach to developing and supporting its eco-innovation programs. Accord- ingly, knowing how different types of eco-innovation complement each other is critical for ﬁrms to effectively implement their entire innovation programs. Responding to the call from the literature, this study intends to offer a holistic view of eco-innovation programs by investigating the inter-relationships among different types of eco-innovation and their impact on business performance. Speciﬁcally, this study ex- amines the relative effects and inter-relationship effects of three types of eco-innovation (eco-process, eco-product, eco-organiza- tional). The following section reviews relevant literature on different types of eco-innovation to develop research hypotheses, followed by a discussion of research methodology, including sam- ples and measurements. The statistical results and discussion are presented and, ﬁnally, managerial implications and suggestions for future research are provided. 2. Eco-innovation types The literature deﬁnes the boundary of eco-innovation into external and internal eco-innovation. The external boundary of eco-innovation includes all external activities of the organization for green and sustainable activities, including suppliers (Lee and Kim, 2011), regulators (del Río et al., 2010), and market demand (Lin et al., 2013). The internal boundary of eco-innovation activities is related to practices for effectively and efﬁciently managing eco- innovation processes within organizations, including organiza- tional management (Eiadat et al., 2008), production process (Dangelico and Pontrandolfo, 2010), and new product development (Lin et al., 2013). For the purpose of this study, we focus on the internal boundary of eco-innovation. Furthermore, researchers have addressed eco-innovation from different perspectives, including government policy (Veugelers, 2012), stakeholders (e.g., customers, suppliers) Klewitz et al., 2012), organizational strategies (Boons and Lüdeke-Freund, 2012), organizational leadership (Chen and Chang, 2012), organizational culture (Porter-O’Grady and Malloch, 2010), and the characteristics of the eco-innovation itself (Lin et al., 2013). With a focus on the internal boundary of eco-innovation, this study investigates the effects of eco-innovation from the organizational strategic perspective. An extensive literature review was conducted to ensure inclu- sion of all relevant aspects of the internal boundary of eco- innovation. For example, Kemp and Arundel (1998) argued that eco-innovations include technical, organizational, and marketing innovations. del Río et al. (2010) classiﬁed eco-innovation types into process/product innovation, mature/immature innovation, and radical/incremental innovation. Horbach (2008) and Triguero et al. (2013) studied three types of eco-innovation: eco-process, eco- product, and eco-organizational innovations. The Oslo Manual, developed by the OECD (2005), identiﬁed four distinct types of eco- innovation: product innovation, process innovation, organizational innovation, and marketing innovation. Overall, for examining in- ternal innovation, the literature seems to suggest a focus on eco- process, eco-product, and eco-organizational innovation activities (Horbach, 2008; Triguero et al., 2013). This classiﬁcation was later conﬁrmed by a ﬁeld study consists of interviews with 24 managers who has more than ﬁfteen years of work experience in environ- mental innovation management. The interviewees shared their experience and offered suggestions regarding the types of eco- innovation activities involved inside of organizations. (More de- tails of the interviews will be described in the research methods section.) This ﬁeld study revealed that eco-innovation imple- mentation should cover every major aspect of the organization, including activities arising from the setting up of the different forms of organization and management in different functions of the organization, activities related to the change or improvement of the manufacturing process function, as well as activities that contribute to the improvement to existing products or the development of new products. In conclusion, synthesizing insights from the literature and the ﬁeldwork, three key eco-innovation types (eco-process, eco- product, and eco-organizational innovations) were identiﬁed for further study. While those three eco-innovation programs have been studied separately, their inter-relationships have never been properly examined in a holistic manner (Hallstedt et al., 2013; Lozano, 2013). The remainder of this section deﬁnes activities related to these three forms of eco-innovations. An eco-process innovation stands for new elements introduced into an organization’s production system for producing eco- products (Negny et al., 2012). In general, eco-process innovation refers to the improvement of existing production processes or the addition of new processes to reduce environmental impact. Rennings (2000) suggested that innovation can be additive solu- tions (e.g., smokestack scrubbers) or be integrated into the pro- duction processes through substitution of inputs, optimization of production, and reclamation of outputs. As a result, eco-process innovation modiﬁes the organization’s operation processes and systems, decreases unit costs of production, produces new or signiﬁcantly improved eco-products, and reduces environmental impacts (Negny et al., 2012). In contrast, an eco-product innovation is the introduction of new or signiﬁcantly improved products (regarding their charac- teristics), such as improvements in technical components and materials (Pujari, 2006). Eco-product innovation is usually inspired by advanced eco technologies, shortening product life cycles, and increasing competition (Carrillo-Hermosilla et al., 2010). The environmental impact of eco-product innovations stems from their use (e.g., fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of cars) and disposal (e.g., heavy metals in batteries) rather than their production. Ac- cording to Pujari et al. (2004), product life cycle analysis involves all aspects of a product, from its creation and use, to its disposal. This concept can be applied to eco-product innovations. For instance, electricity produced from wind power is an example of the use of creation. The compact ﬂuorescent bulb is another example of en- ergy a chloroﬂuorocarbon-free air conditioner is considered green pri- marily due to its reduced disposal impact. In short, eco-product innovations aim at reducing environmental impacts during an eco-product’s entire life cycle (Christensen, 2011). a product, while saving through the use of Finally, according to Birkinshaw et al. (2008), an eco- organizational innovation refers to upgrading the organization’s management processes through a new and eco method in business practices. Eco-organizational innovations thus can improve busi- ness performance by supporting necessary changes, reducing administrative and transaction costs, improving workplace satis- faction, or reducing costs of supplies (Cruz et al., 2006). Eco- organizational innovation generally does not reduce environ- mental impacts directly, but facilitates the implementation of eco- process and eco-product innovations (Murphy and Gouldson, 2000). Kemp and Arundel summarized that eco- innovations include eco-training programs, eco- organizational (1998) C.C.J. Cheng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 64 (2014) 81e90 83 product design programs, eco-learning techniques, or the creation of management teams to deal with eco issues. Thus, eco- organizational innovations are related to administrative efforts toward renewing organizational routines, procedures, mecha- nisms, or systems to produce eco-innovations in the end (Cruz et al., 2006). In summary, eco-process innovations are directly related to operations activities, while eco-organizational innovations are indirectly related to the organization’s basic work activities and infrastructure, and eventually affect the entire management sys- tems. In addition, eco-product innovations can be viewed as creating new products aimed at satisfying market needs, while eco- process innovations are concerned with introducing new tech- niques into production operations. While the relationship between three types of eco-innovation might have been discussed individ- ually, to our knowledge, there are no studies that speciﬁcally examine the formation of different types of eco-innovation as a whole. The next section discusses such relationships and the rela- tive impact each eco-innovation type has on business performance. Accordingly, a research model with several hypotheses is developed. 3. Theoretical development Resource-Based View (RBV) provides a good theoretical basis to discuss the contribution of resources and capabilities to perfor- mance in each of the aforementioned three types of eco- innovation. Speciﬁcally, these theories shed light on the relations among internal resources, capabilities and performance, which constitutes the basis for discussing eco-innovation in a holistic view. The principal idea of the RBV and Natural RBV is that the competitive advantage of a ﬁrm lies in its heterogeneous resources, which are valuable, inimitable, and non-substitutable (Barney, 1991). In order to use such assets, a ﬁrm has to develop and accu- mulate them over time (Markard and Worch, 2010). However, the RBV has been criticized for not being able to explain how resources are deployed to achieve competitive advantage (DeSarbo et al., 2005). Teece et al. (1997) proposed the concept of Dynamic Capa- bilities that emphasizes appropriating, adapting, integrating, and reconﬁguring internal and external organizational competence to match the requirements of changing environments. Therefore, competence is seen as the basis of competitiveness, and it enables a ﬁrm to innovate new products, to offer new values to customers, and thus to develop a sustained competitive advantage (van Kleef and Roome, 2007). Built on the concept of RBV, Hart (1995, 2005) developed Nat- ural RBV by including the constraints and opportunities of the natural environment. According to Natural RBV, environmental practices require the accumulation of resources and the manage- ment of capabilities within the ﬁrm. Thus, Hart (1995) developed a concept of green capabilities, while Sharma and Vredenburg (1998), Hart (2005), and Hart and Dowell (2011) further elabo- rated and empirically corroborated this concept to highlight the links among environmental strategies, capabilities development, and competitive advantage. Accordingly, eco-process innovation, eco-product innovation, and eco-organizational innovation can be viewed as distinctive green capabilities developed with various resources including administrative support, organizational activities and structure, green infrastructure, eco technologies, and so on. The accumulation of those resources toward green activities develops unique green capabilities in the form of the three types of eco-innovation, which should in turn contribute to competitive advantage and business performance. Fig. 1 displays the basic model that displays the theoretical re- lationships among three types of eco-innovation on business performance. in the form of structural First, previous studies implied that an organizational innovation leading to administrative and structural renewal is a facilitator for the other types of innovation (Damanpour et al., 2009). In practice, through organizational renewal im- provements, eco-organizational innovation can create better intra- organizational coordination and cooperation mechanisms toward effective environmental management. Namely, eco-organizational innovations are able to contribute to a ﬁtting environment conducive with the development of eco-product and eco-process innovations. For instance, Staropoli (1998) veriﬁed the impor- tance of organizational innovation in enhancing technological in- novations in the pharmaceutical industry. Germain (1996) found that organizational innovations might be signiﬁcant predictors of process sector. More recently, Armbruster et al. (2008) indicated that organizational innovations lead to product innovations. Walker (2008) asserted that organi- zational and product innovations were found to be inter-related. Borrowing from the general innovation literature, we propose that the same relationships exist in the context of eco-innovation. Namely, eco-organizational innovations can contribute to the for- mation of eco-process and eco-product innovations. innovations in the logistics H1: The greater the ﬁrm’s eco-organizational innovation, the greater its eco-process innovation. H2: The greater the ﬁrm’s eco-organizational innovation, the greater its eco-product innovation. While the literature does not offer explicit empirical results for the relationship between eco-process innovation and eco-product innovation, previous general innovation studies lend theoretical support for their relationship. For example, Klepper (1996) argued that product innovation must precede process innovation for better effect. On the other hand, Damanpour and Aravind (2006) and Adner and Levinthal (2001) both indicated that product and pro- cess innovations are complementary to each other and that ﬁrms that pursue both simultaneously would produce better perfor- mance. Finally, Ettlie and Reza (1992) suggested that various pro- cess innovation activities such as installing new equipment, redeﬁning task speciﬁcations, and upgrading information ﬂow, could facilitate new product development. Oke (2007) also found that an effectively new manufacturing process (e.g., a decrease in the unit costs of production) was necessary to facilitate product innovation. Many recent studies (e.g., Bigliardi and Dormio, 2009; Raymond and St-Pierre, 2010; Maine et al., 2012) seem to support the notion that process innovation often equips existing production processes with advanced techniques which, in turn, improves the capability of adding new product features to meet the market needs. In short, the improvement of eco-process innovations is a Fig. 1. The research model. (H: Hypothesis). 84 C.C.J. Cheng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 64 (2014) 81e90 driving force for eco-product innovations. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed. H3: The greater the ﬁrm’s eco-process innovation, the greater its eco-product innovation. Many studies on the innovationeperformance relationship suggested successful innovations improve business performance. For example, Baer and Frese (2003) examined the effects of process innovation, and Li and Atuahene-Gima (2001) conﬁrmed the ben- eﬁts of product innovation. The contribution of environmental management (including all three types of eco-innovation) on business performance has also been recognized since Porter and Van der Linde’s seminal work (1995). Several publications clearly conﬁrmed the links between pro-active environmental strategy (including innovation) and business performance, as well as the generation of organizational capabilities through environmental practices (see, for example, Christmann, 2000; Klassen and Whybark, 1999; Marcus and Geffen, 1998). All of them supported positive associations between process/product innovations and business performance. Accordingly, we propose that business per- formance (measured by ROI, market share, proﬁtability, and sales) can be enhanced by eco-process innovation and eco-product innovation. H4: The greater the ﬁrm’s eco-process innovation, the greater its business performance. H5: The greater the ﬁrm’s eco-product innovation, the greater its business performance. Previous studies also advocated the contribution of both regular organizational and eco-organizational innovations (e.g., innovative design, speed, or ﬂexibility) to a ﬁrm’s business performance (e.g., Armbruster et al., 2008; Klassen and Whybark, 1999). Strategic theories suggest that organizations that adopt an innovation (e.g., capabilities, resources, technologies, or knowledge of the innova- tion) would subsequently create a unique mechanism that protects proﬁt margins, thus enabling the organization to gain great beneﬁts (Teece et al., 1997). Lin and Chen (2007) speciﬁcally associated organizational innovation with improved business performance. Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed. H6: The greater the ﬁrm’s eco-organizational innovation, the greater its business performance. Overall, these research hypotheses allow the study to closely examine both the direct effects and indirect effects of eco-process and eco-organizational innovations. Speciﬁcally, eco-process, eco- product and eco-organizational innovations directly improve business performance respectively (H4, H5 and H6). Moreover, eco- organizational innovation indirectly affects business performance via the mediators, eco-process innovation (H1) and eco-product innovation (H2), and eco-product innovation also mediates the relationship between eco-process innovation and business perfor- mance (H3). Namely through eco-product innovation, eco-process innovation and eco-organizational innovation could indirectly enhance ﬁrms’ business performance. Eco-product innovation al- lows a ﬁrm to incorporate its organizational innovative activities into developing new goods or services. Similarly, those activities also facilitate eco-process innovation to enhance business perfor- mance. Consequently, the total effects of eco-organizational inno- vation and eco-process innovation on business performance are likely to include their direct effects as well as indirect effects through eco-product innovation. Previous research has demon- strated other types of capabilities as mediators, such as marketing capabilities or operations capabilities, within the capabilityeper- formance relationship (e.g., Murray et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2013). To our best knowledge, no studies have investigated the inter- relationships among the three forms of eco-innovation. 4. Research methods The survey method is used in this study to provide an overview of the existing eco-innovation practices and effectiveness in Taiwan. This section presents the development and validation of eco-innovation measurement. A discussion of data collection and sample used for statistical analysis is also presented. 4.1. Measurement development While previous studies have identiﬁed and validated the scales of innovation variables (e.g., Damanpour et al., 2009), none of the scales was speciﬁcally developed for eco-innovation. To ensure the validity of the study, we decided to develop new scales for eco- innovation, following suggestions of Churchill (1979). Based on ﬁeld studies and the relevant literature (e.g., Rennings and Zwick, 2002; Murphy and Gouldson, 2000; Kemp and Arundel, 1998), the domain of eco-innovation was created and an initial list of items was generated. The ﬁeld studies were conducted in Taiwan, including 24 in-depth interviews with managers and one focus group. All the interview participants were managers with more than ﬁfteen years of work experience in environmental innovation management. The computer manufacturers in Taiwan rely heavily on exporting to Europe and the U.S., and they have to regularly engage in various eco-innovation programs to meet strict interna- tional environmental regulations (e.g., WEEE) (Tung and Wan, 2013; Yang and Sheu, 2011). As a result, Taiwanese manufacturers seem to offer an appropriate case for the study of eco-innovation issues. As suggested by Eisenhardt (1989) and Yin (2009), an interview protocol was developed and subsequently pretested by two aca- demics specializing in marketing research. Next, each interviewee received a ﬁle with a brief introduction, the purpose of this study, a guarantee of conﬁdentiality, and a request for an interview. During the interviews, notes were taken and the proceedings of each interview were tape recorded. If necessary, follow-up interviews were conducted to clarify issues or explore for more details. On average, each interview took 54 min. Finally, the authors and two other academics used the software NVivo 8 (NVivo, 2008) to code interviewees’ open-ended responses electronically and then to organize them into theoretical themes, meaningful phrases, cross- tabulated items, and initial sets of scale items. To ensure a comprehensive list of eco-innovation items was generated, we also conducted one focus group discussion with 12 participants. Following the same procedure as that used for the interviews, the focus group discussions were video-recorded, transcribed and then analyzed using NVivo 8 computer software. Six of the 12 participants were academics specializing in eco- innovation research and six were senior managers with a mini- mum of 15 years of work experience related to eco-innovation. All participants were screened to conﬁrm their willingness to partici- pate and their familiarity with our study. The focus group was conducted in a conference room at a convention center and it lasted 88 min. As a result, 20 items were generated, including ﬁve items measuring the eco-process construct, eight items measuring the eco-product construct, and seven items measuring the eco- organizational construct. Business performance was measured using four items devel- oped by Im and Workman (2004). All the items were self-reported by asking respondents to rate their market and ﬁnancial C.C.J. Cheng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 64 (2014) 81e90 85 performance (ROI, sales, proﬁt, and market share) compared with that of their major competitors. The use of subjective performance measures is a well-accepted approach (Atuahene-Gima and Ko, 2001; Im and Workman, 2004). All items were subsequently evaluated by two university pro- fessors who specialized in innovation research and four senior managers with extensive experience developing eco-innovation to ensure content and face validity. Suggestions for additional mea- sures were also requested. As a result, all items remained on the list, while a few of the items were revised to improve their speciﬁcity and precision (e.g., “radically improve” was replaced with “inno- vatively update”). For those items adapted from previous studies (e.g., business performance) and written in English, a double- translation method was used to translate them into Chinese. Spe- ciﬁcally, the authors initially translated the items into Chinese; another two academics then translated the Chinese version back into English; and ﬁnally, this translation work was checked by the third academic to ensure conceptual equivalence. The initial in- strument contained 24 items that were measured on a 7-point Likert scale (1 ¼ strongly disagree; 7 ¼ strongly agree). Once the initial set of items was ready, a pilot-test was performed to ensure its reliability and validity. Performing a pilot-test is an important step in the scale development process, because it can remove invalid items (Anderson and Gerbing, 1991). The pilot-test used a convenience sample of 53 senior managers with experience in eco-innovation activities. Of the respondents, 72% were from IT manufacturing, 54% of were product managers, 65% were male, the average number of years working was 18.4 years, and all were be- tween the ages of 38 and 62. They were asked to complete a ques- tionnaire to indicate any ambiguity or difﬁculty in responding to the questions and to offer any suggestions they thought appropriate. At this stage, some wordings were reﬁned but all 24 items were retained. 4.2. Sample and data collection Samples were collected from Taiwan Environmental Manage- ment Association (www.ema.org.tw), a renowned trade association with more than 20,000 members. During the sample screening, emails were sent to identify those who had extensive experience in eco-innovation. Similar to the previous innovation studies (e.g., Atuahene-Gima and Ko, 2001), senior managers responsible for eco-innovation development were selected. Based on these criteria, each member was requested to provide the name of a senior manager involved in eco-innovation development. To this end, these procedures produced a sample of 611 ﬁrms. Using Dillman’s (2000) design method for mail surveys, 611 copies of the questionnaire were mailed, along with preaddressed postage-paid envelopes and a cover letter explaining the purpose of the study, expressing appreciation for participating, and assuring the conﬁdentiality of the shared information. The questionnaire included three sections: (1) the covering page with contact infor- mation, (2) a series of items on eco-process innovation, eco-product innovation, eco-organizational innovation, and business perfor- mance, and (3) demographics. After a follow up contact by mail, telephone, or fax, 121 usable questionnaires were collected, resulting in a response rate of 19.8%. Of the participants, 58% were male, the average number of working years was 14.2, and their ages ranged between 36 and 55 years. The samples covered four in- dustries and were classiﬁed under the three-digit level of Taiwan’s Standard Industry Classiﬁcation (SIC), including Manufacture of Communication Equipment (SIC: 272, 29%), Manufacture of Com- puters and Peripheral Equipment (SIC: 271, 32%), Manufacture of Integrated Circuits (SIC: 261, 34.5%), and others (4.5%). More than 70% of the sample consists of large ﬁrms with over 3000 employees and 68.9% have been established over 15 years. 4.3. Non-response bias and common method bias To assess the possibility that those participants who responded were systematically different from those who chose not to partic- ipate, an assessment for non-response bias was performed (Armstrong and Overton, 1977). A comparison of the means of all items was conducted by one-way ANOVA using SPSS 19. All mean pair comparisons exhibit insigniﬁcant differences at .05, suggesting no non-response bias occurs. Since the measures for the independent and dependent variables are collected from the same respondents in the same way, there is a potential for common method bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003). If com- mon method variance exists, a Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis con- taining all constructs should produce a single method factor (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). The goodness-of-ﬁt indices (c2/ d.f. ¼ 27.8, RMSEA ¼ .33, CFI ¼ .42, NFI ¼ .31, PNFI ¼ .37) indicate a poor ﬁt for the single factor model. In addition, Harman’s one-factor test is also used, where all variables are simultaneously entered into an exploratory factor analysis through principal components without rotation. According to the results, no single factor emerges that could account for the majority of the covariance in the mea- sures. Overall, both tests suggest no common method bias occurs. 5. Statistical results This section examines the psychometric properties of mea- surement, including reliability, and convergent and discriminant validity. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was applied to test research hypotheses with ﬁrm size and ﬁrm age as control variables. For ﬁrm size, we used the logarithm of the number of employees. Firm age is deﬁned as the number of years the ﬁrm has been in operation. The results of SEM analysis regarding the direct, indirect, and total effects of three types of eco-innovation on business performance are also presented. 5.1. Psychometric properties To purify the sample, we conducted Exploratory Factor Analysis to identify dimensionality of eco-innovation, and then assessed reliability and item-to-total correlations (see Table 1). Five factors were extracted, accounting for 78.3% of the variance in the construct with the ﬁrst factor explaining 22.8%. Three items in the ﬁfth factor were temporarily regarded as outliers. The tests for reliability and item-to-total correlations were then conducted and a factor was accepted if the Cronbach’s alpha value was greater than .7 (Nunnally, 1978). Items were deleted if they negatively correlated to other items within a scale or had a correlation value below .1. The results show that, without the three outliers, all fac- tors have Cronbach’s alpha values from .86 to .93. Previous re- searchers have suggested that unusual patterns of scores can cause a threat to validity/reliability of a scale and disproportionately in- ﬂuence the results (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2006). Three outliers identiﬁed were discarded for their low correlation value, below .1, and negative correlations with other items. As a result, 21 items were retained for the subsequent tests (see Appendix for the complete list of measurement items). We further evaluated measurement properties by running Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis. Following the suggestions from Hult et al. (2004), we divided the items into four related groups. Each item was set to load only on its respective latent construct, and the latent constructs were allowed to be correlated.

Business performance measures are also represented satisfactorily (c2/d.f. ¼ 1.46, RMSEA ¼ .05, CFI ¼ .94, NNFI ¼ .97, PNFI ¼ .87). The factor loading of indicators is signiﬁcant (p < .01) and well above the recommended levels (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1993). We proceeded to examine construct convergent and discrimi- nant validity. Composite reliability is an indicator of shared variance among the set of observed variables used as indicators of a latent construct (Fornell and Larcker,1981). As shown in the Appendix, the composite reliabilities of all constructs exceed the usual .60 bench- mark (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988). The results provide the necessary evi- dence that all the constructs exhibit convergent validity. Discriminant validity was reviewed by comparing the average variance extracted (AVE) with the variance each factor shared with the other factors in the model (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). The re- sults in Table 2 suggest that all the diagonal elements representing the square root of the AVE are greater than the highest shared variance (the off-diagonal correlations). In addition to Fornell and Larcker’s procedure, we also examined discriminant validity, using an alternative approach that Anderson and Gerbing (1988) recommended. The chi-square values for the unconstrained models, which allowed each pair of constructs to co- vary freely, were always signiﬁcantly lower than those of the con- strained models, which constrained the estimated correlation of each pair of estimated constructs to one. In this study, the value of the unconstrained model is signiﬁcantly lower than that of the Table 2 The correlation matrix.

The chi-square difference is signiﬁcant at p < .001). Since the criteria for both approaches are satisﬁed, an inference error of multicollinearity is unlikely. Accordingly, the measurement model ﬁts the data satisfactorily and exhibits unidimensionality, conver- gent, and discriminant validity. 5.2. SEM analysis SEM was applied because it accounts for measurement error and corrects for attenuation, thereby overcoming many of the problems associated with regression models (Jaccard and Wan, 1996). As such, following Ping (1995), this study uses SEM with maximum likelihood estimation to test the hypotheses. The SEM results (c2/ d.f. ¼ 1.89, RMSEA ¼ .03, CFI ¼ .95, NNFI ¼ .93, PNFI ¼ .84) conform to the acceptable standards, demonstrating an acceptable level of model ﬁt for our research model. Turning to individual research hypotheses, eco-organizational innovation is positively and signif- icantly related to both eco-process and eco-product innovations (b ¼ .59, p < .01; b ¼ .46, p < .01), supporting H1 and H2. Eco- process innovation is signiﬁcantly related to eco-product innova- tion (b ¼ .41, p < .01) and H3 is supported. Finally, eco-process, eco- product, and eco-organizational innovations are positively and signiﬁcantly related to business performance (b ¼ .42, p < .01; b ¼ .36; p < .01; b ¼ .51, p < .01). Thus, H4, H5, and H6 are sup- ported. In summary, all the arrows in Fig. 1 are signiﬁcant (p < .01), conﬁrming our hypotheses regarding the relationships among three different eco-innovation types and business performance. 5.3. Mediation effects The direct effects of eco-organizational and eco-process in- novations on eco-performance are expected and consistent with the extant innovation literature (e.g., Damanpour et al., 2009). However, their indirect effects were never properly examined. Using Baron and Kenny (1986)’s approach, we examined the mediating effects of eco-organizational and eco-process in- novations in greater details. Three competing models were tested: full mediating, partial mediating, and no mediating. The hypothe- sized (partial mediating) model was used as the basis for comparing with the nested model. The signiﬁcance level of the changes in chi-square results between three models reﬂects the effects of the added paths. If chi-square difference tests show that the competing models do not improve the ﬁt signiﬁcantly, at the .05 level, then the partial mediating model will be supported (Baron and Kenny, 1986). The SEM results in Table 3 reveal that the partial mediating model has better ﬁt than the “full mediating” model, and the full mediating model is better than the “no mediating” model. This ﬁnding suggests that the partial mediating models most accurately represent the data and should be used to illustrate the relationships among all eco-innovation types. Namely, eco-product innovation mediates the performance of eco-organization and eco-process innovations. Eco-process innovation, which is found to be signiﬁ- cantly associated with performance, inﬂuences business perfor- mance through eco-product In addition, eco- organization innovation has direct and indirect (through eco- product innovation) effects on business performance. innovation. 5.4.

Cheng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 64 (2014) 81e90 87 innovation has the strongest effect (b ¼ .77) on business perfor- mance due to its direct (b ¼ .51) and especially indirect effects (b ¼ .26) via eco-process and eco-product innovations. In addition, it has stronger positive direct (b ¼ .46) and indirect (b ¼ .22) im- pacts on eco-product innovation than that of eco-process innova- tion (b ¼ .41). These results extend the organizational literature and stress that eco-organizational innovation indeed plays a funda- mental role in enhancing eco-process and eco-product innovative activities.

Eco-process innovation, despite showing a slightly weaker direct effect than eco-organizational innovation on business performance, exhibits a stronger total effect on business performance than that of eco-product innovation. The total effect of eco-organizational and eco-process innovations on business per- formance is b ¼ .36 and b ¼ .43, respectively. The direct, indirect, and total effects of eco-organizational, eco-process, and eco- product innovations on business performance are summarized in Table 4. 6. Discussion Examining all three types of eco-innovation and reviewing their inter-relationship offers a holistic view of eco-innovation programs that previous studies fail to do. The analysis of direct and indirect effects of individual eco-innovation types also pro- vides valuable guidelines for developing well-aligned eco-inno- vation programs. First, the results on Table 3 delineate the inter-relationship be- tween eco-organizational, eco-process, and eco-product innova- tion. While eco-process innovation mediates the effect of eco- product innovation, both types of innovation act as bridges be- tween eco-organizational innovation and business performance. It is important to recognize the mediating effect of organizational and process innovation, as previous studies are likely to under-estimate the impact of organizational innovation by focusing only on its direct effect. The statistical ﬁndings in Table 4 further indicate that, among eco-organizational eco-innovation types, three all The ﬁndings in Tables 3 and 4 also lend additional support for a causal relationship between eco-process and eco-product in- novations. Namely, process innovation activities could effectively facilitate new product development. Additionally, including orga- nizational innovation in this discussion would provide managers with a holistic view of eco-innovation management. Our results imply that ﬁrms should ﬁrst engage in eco-organizational innova- tion, develop necessary infrastructure, and obtain eco knowledge in order to be ready for improving their manufacturing processes and existing eco-products. Along with eco-organizational innovation, innovative eco-process innovation develops competence (e.g., tools, upgrading required manufacturing processes for new eco-product development, which, as a result, leads to introduction of new eco-products to the marketplace. knowledge) devices, and in Treating organizational innovation as the fundamental of developing eco-innovation programs seems to be consistent with the industry practice. For instance, when developing its eco- innovation programs, Asus, a renowned IT manufacturer in Taiwan, ﬁrst engaged in extensive organizational innovation ac- tivities by distributing new eco-knowledge within the ﬁrm and building a management team to guide further process and product innovations (Asus Annual Report, 2008). Consequently, the company was able to develop innovation capability and continuously deliver impressive sales growth. This example clearly illustrates how organizational innovation can provide organizations with continual organizational learning, which leads to more effective eco-innovation and better business per- formance. Overall, this study lends additional evidence to orga- nizational technical innovation is directly related to organizational innovation activ- ities (Damanpour et al., 2009). innovation literature indicates that Another interesting ﬁnding is the differential business per- formance between eco-process and eco-product innovations. Without considering eco-process innovation’s mediating effect, one would have concluded that both eco-process and eco- product innovations have similar inﬂuence on business perfor- mance. Nonetheless, based on total effect, eco-product innova- tion clearly has less inﬂuence on business performance (b ¼ .36) compared to that of eco-process innovation (b ¼ .67). One possible interpretation is that new eco-products are a necessary result of eco-innovation. Fig. 2 summarizes the results of the mediating effects.

Cheng et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 64 (2014) 81e90 Drawing from the extant innovation literature and the ﬁeld studies, we constructed a research model that demonstrates the relative importance of each type of eco-innovation, and the nature of the interdependency between them. While previous studies suggested possible relationship between organizational innovation and product/process innovation, there is never a deﬁnite conclu- sion as to how eco-organizational innovation can contribute to the formation of eco-product or eco-process innovations. Our statistical results suggest that eco-process and eco-product innovations partially mediate the effects of eco-organizational innovation, and eco-product innovation mediates eco-process innovations’ effects on business performance. Business performance is directly and indirectly affected by eco-organizational, eco-process, and eco- product innovations. Several research contributions are noteworthy. First, the importance of systematically implementing various aspects (e.g., technological, sustainable, social, organizational, etc.) of innovation programs has been previously suggested. However, the current eco- innovation research does not offer a holistic view of eco-innovation (Hallstedt et al., 2013; Lozano, 2013). As indicated by Jayal et al. (2010), to achieve green and sustainable manufacturing requires a holistic view spanning product, manufacturing processes, and managerial systems across multiple product life cycles. As such, a major contribution of this study to the eco-innovation literature is to employ the RBV theory to frame a conceptual model that links organizational resources (three types of eco-innovation) and business performance, and therefore, provide a holistic view in explaining the inter-relationship among eco-process, eco-product, and eco-organizational innovations. Consequently, a holistic view of the eco-innovation program provides a valuable, inimitable, and non-substitutable resource that should enable a ﬁrm to develop the competence leading to better business performance. Second, the relationships among the three eco-innovation components and their effects on business performance suggest that all components could be performed in a distinct role but also be performed in a systemic manner. In particular, the eco-process innovation literature typically focused on cost reduction or oper- ating system adjustment but failed to recognize the need for dis- cussing how process innovation facilitates eco-product innovation or mediates eco-organizational innovation. Moreover, our ﬁndings add to the eco-innovation literature by uncovering the underlying innovation development process of which eco-organizational innovation is the fundamental for building eco-process and eco- product innovations. Evidently, without a systemic view of all three types of eco-innovation simultaneously, managers would not be able to realize effective eco-innovation programs. Finally, previous studies related to organizational innovation have focused primarily on the technological aspect and neglected change in the social system. This study enriches the organizational innovation literature by arguing that a simultaneous adoption of technological (e.g., eco-produce and eco-process) and administra- tive (e.g., eco-organizational) innovation is important to ﬁrms. Our ﬁndings also offer several managerial implications. First, eco-organizational restructuring brings about managerial and structural renewal and facilitates creating eco-manufacturing pro- cesses. In practice, managers must rebuild their eco-infrastructure to motivate and reward eco-organizational members, devise strategy and structure of tasks and units, and modify the organi- zation’s management processes (e.g., new management accounting methods, or an enterprise resource planning system). Second, management must fully understand the relative bene- ﬁts and limitations of each eco-innovation type, in order to improve and eco-process business performance. Eco-organizational innovations are able to help ﬁrms directly in achieving better business performance, compared with eco-product innovation. However, both eco-organizational and eco-process innovations can achieve better business performance due to their inﬂuences on eco- product innovation. Therefore, when adopting eco-innovation, management needs to rely on, invest in and implement all three types of eco-innovation, with an initial emphasis on eco- organizational innovation. Third, the results of this study could offer policy makers guidelines regarding developing effective environmental regula- tions to enforce the development of effective eco-innovation pro- grams in industry. The lack of resources would hinder the development of environmental management. The literature has suggested proper environmental regulation could force or encourage the industry to make eco-decisions that lead to better resource efﬁciency and higher environmental productivity (Porter and van der Linde, 1995; Brio and Junquera, 2003; Yang and Sheu, 2011). Our ﬁndings indicate that a successful eco-innovation pro- gram requires a systemic approach. In particular, administrative support programs must be in place to enhance the technological aspects of eco-innovation. Administrative activities generally do not reduce environmental impacts directly, and managers are in- clined to place more emphases on technological aspects of inno- vation (Brio and Junquera, 2003). Evidently, without necessary procedures and administrative support, resource investment in eco-product and eco-process innovations would not be as effective, considering the indirect effects of eco-organizational innovation. Therefore, policy makers should set regulations or offer incentives to prompt companies to design and implement eco-innovation programs in a more effective sequence. In short, this study conﬁrms the inter-relationships and contri- butions of three eco-innovation types. The synergetic mechanism identiﬁed in this study should assist managers in gaining an inte- gral understanding of the concept of eco-innovation and its implementation for improving business performance. This study has several limitations that should be considered in the interpretation and implication of its ﬁndings. First, while business performance was measured by several subjective in- dicators, a true effect of eco-innovation on performance can be evaluated more effectively through collecting a diversity of view- points (e.g., objective data) to potentially overcome such biases. Second, the relationship between eco-innovation and business performance may be moderated by factors including innovation attributes (e.g. relative advantage) and managers’ characteristics (e.g. entrepreneurship orientation). Moderating effects were not examined here and would need to be explored in the future. Third, this study only examined three types of eco-innovation. Other types of innovation (e.g., marketing innovation, technological innovation) should be included in the future studies. Finally, the ﬁndings may be peculiar to Taiwanese ﬁrms. Pohlmann et al. (2005, p. 3) found that innovation activities are closely related to “social behavior of a speciﬁc culture setting.” The applicability of our ﬁndings to other countries should be considered with caution. The replication of this research in other countries is necessary to ensure global generalizability of the ﬁndings. Similarly, we have grounded our arguments on concepts and models, from innovation literature, which have mainly been developed in the context of manufacturing organizations. Additional tests of our theoretical argument across other business organizations (e.g., service) and with other mea- sures of performance should add to the conclusiveness of our ﬁndings. Finally, this study examined how the increased compe- tence resulting from a holistic view of eco-innovation programs improves business performance. Future studies should also review the eco-innovation e environmental performance e business per- formance connection. Appendix. Eco-innovation Measurement (continued ) C.C.J.
