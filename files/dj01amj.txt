TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT IMPLEMENTATION  AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: THE ROLE OF  STRUCTURAL CONTROL AND EXPLORATION  THOMAS J. DOUGLAS  Clemson University  WILLIAM Q. JUDGE, JR.  University of Tennessee  We explored the relationship between the degree to which total quality management  (TQM) practices were adopted within organizations and the corresponding competi-  tive advantages achieved. We found relatively strong support for this relationship. In  addition, our data showed some support for the moderating influence of organizational  structure on TQM implementation effectiveness. Specifically, two measures of organi-  zational structure, labeled "control" and "exploration," were found to offer indepen-  dent and interdependent influences on the financial performance of firms implement-  ing TQM programs.  Much has been written about total quality man-  agement (TQM) practices and the many benefits  that these practices bring to the organization that  successfully adopts them. Notably, a considerable  number of organizations have tried to implement  these practices and have failed to achieve much, if  any, competitive advantage, while many other or-  ganizations have implemented TQM with great  success. Some observers have argued that the prob-  lem lies either with the failure to fully implement  all of the key TQM practices (Hackman & Wage-  man, 1995) or with the absence of complementary  assets that must be combined with TQM to achieve  competitive advantage (Carmen et al., 1996; Wald-  man & Gopalakrishnan, 1996).  Exacerbating this problem is the situation whereby  "research is not providing the corrective function for  TQM that it could and should" (Hackman & Wage-  man, 1995: 339). For instance, a reason given for the  lack of conclusive evidence in the literature lies in the  treatment of TQM as a "discrete phenomenon" (West-  phal, Gulati, & Shortell, 1997). In fact, Hackman and  Wageman found that only 4 percent of the 99 articles  published between 1989 and 1993 on TQM "assessed  the degree to which TQM interventions actually were  in place" (1995: 321). Given the complexity and per-  vasiveness of implementing TQM in an organization  (Westphal et al., 1997), it is important to assess the  degree to which TQM practices have been imple-  The authors thank Barbara Ribbens for her very helpful  comments and the editors and two anonymous reviewers  for their insightful suggestions on drafts of this work.  158  mented when evaluating TQM's relationship with  competitive advantage.  In addition, it has been argued that for an organi-  zation to realize the value of a TQM implementation,  it must have an internal organizational structure that  is capable of frilly supporting the implementation  (Waldman & Gopalakrishnan, 1996). According to  Shea and Howell (1998), the preferred structure for  organizations that implement TQM balances the need  for control of activities with the flexibility needed to  respond and adapt quickly to the changing market-  place. It is thus important to assess organizational  structure when evaluating an organization's TQM im-  plementation. The purpose of this study was to ex-  amine the degree to which a comprehensive set of  TQM practices was implemented in a set of organi-  zations, the effect of organizational structure on im-  plementation effectiveness, and the corresponding  competitive advantages gained through TQM. The  setting for this examination was the general medical  hospital industry. This industry is particularly appro-  priate for the study of the effectiveness of TQM pro-  gram implementation since it commenced using  TQM as an industrywide recipe for success in the  mid to late 1980s and continues this effort to the  present day (Westphal et al., 1997).  THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT  Recent literature has begun to describe and eval-  uate TQM as a potential source of competitive ad-  vantage (Powell, 1995). The implementation of  TQM is accomplished through a set of practices  that supports the TQM philosophy (Dean & Bowen,  1994). TQM philosophy dictates that the practices This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 15 Feb 2017 20:22:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2001 Douglas and Judge 159  function as an interdependent system (Hackman &  Wageman, 1995) that can combine with other orga-  nizational assets to generate competitive advantage  (Powell, 1995). As Schendel (1994) pointed out,  competitive advantage is based not on individual  assets or practices that can be easily duplicated, but  on the combination of a series of assets that he  labeled "compound assets." Drawing from the re-  cent literature on TQM (Dean & Bowen, 1994;  Hackman & Wageman, 1995; Powell, 1995), we  identified seven key or common practices that  combine to support the TQM philosophy. These  practices are: top management team involvement,  adoption of a quality philosophy, emphasis on  TQM-oriented training, focus on the customer, con-  tinuous improvement of processes, management by  fact, and use of TQM methods.  To gain the full potential of TQM, a hospital must  implement all seven of these TQM practices to the  greatest extent possible. According to industry ex-  perts, proper implementation of TQM in hospitals  is a critical determinant in enhancing organiza-  tional performance (Shortell et al., 1995; Westphal  et al., 1997). As Carmen and his colleagues (1996)  pointed out in their study of TQM in hospitals,  some organizations are much more deliberate and  comprehensive in their implementation of TQM  than are others. This variability in implementation  efforts emphasizes the importance of focusing on  the depth of the implementation, not just on the  mere presence of a TQM program. Unfortunately,  very few past researchers have attempted to so mea-  sure degree of implementation (Hackman & Wage-  man, 1995).  Preliminary evidence from Powell (1995) indi-  cated that TQM-adopting firms do obtain a compet-  itive advantage over firms that do not adopt TQM.  Consequently, theory and research suggest that the  greater the degree to which a comprehensive set of  TQM practices is adopted by a hospital, the greater  the competitive advantages achieved, and the  higher the hospital's performance. Therefore, the  following hypothesis is offered:  Hypothesis 1. The degree of implementation of  TQM practices in a hospital is positively re-  lated to the hospital's performance.  A number of scholars have argued that a support-  ive organizational structure is needed to enhance  the effectiveness of TQM implementation (Shea &  Howell, 1998; Waldman & Gopalakrishnan, 1996).  Sitkin, Sutcliffe, and Schroeder (1994) argued that  the effectiveness of total quality management de-  pends on an organization's ability to balance con-  trol and learning. The need for control is evident in  TQM's use of formal scientific methods for the  elimination of variation using statistical process  control (Hackman & Wageman, 1995). The need for  learning is evident in TQM's emphasis on organi-  zational learning and continuous improvement  (Grant, 1996).  Shea and Howell (1998) presented compelling  arguments that the monodimensional mechanistic/  organic structural scale proposed by Burns and  Stalker (1961) is no longer appropriate in a TQM  environment. Instead, they suggested two dimen-  sions-the first focusing on level of standardization  and the second on level of decentralization. They  argued that standardization of TQM techniques and  feedback loops helps an organization to control its  systems and processes. However, decentralization  is also necessary to allow employees to explore and  experiment with creative process improvement  ideas.  Recent theory and research on organizational  structure, independent of the TQM literature, is  coming to the same conclusion. Eisenhardt and  Tabrizi (1995) argued that organizational structure  must have a stabilizing (that is, controlling) and  creative (exploring) impact on organizations, espe-  cially in turbulent environments. Similarly, Sut-  cliffe, Sitkin, and Browning (1999) argued that or-  ganizational structure must both standardize opera-  tions across an organization to ensure the reliability  of outcomes (the control dimension) and at the  same time keep the organization open and flexible  to new ideas (the exploration dimension). Perhaps  summing this up best, Stacey maintained that  organizations need to maintain a creative tension  "between the clear-cut, rigid forms of control re-  quired to handle the knowable and the spontaneity  necessary to handle the unknowable" (1992: 184).  Evidence from recent studies in the hospital in-  dustry provides some support for the need to have  both the control and exploratory dimensions of  structure for the successful implementation of  TQM. Carmen and his colleagues (1996), in their  in-depth study of ten hospitals, found that a con-  tinuous learning culture enhanced the relationship  between continuous improvement and hospital  performance. Shortell and coauthors (1995) found  similar results, but they also emphasized the need  for a formal, strategic quality plan to be present to  ensure superior efficiency. Finally, Motwani,  Sower, and Brashier (1996) prescribed a structured,  standardized approach for the successful imple-  mentation of TQM in hospitals. Given this theory  and preliminary research, the following hypotheses  are advanced:  Hypothesis 2. In a hospital characterized by a  greater focus on control in its structure, the This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 15 Feb 2017 20:22:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  160 Academy of Management Joural February  degree of implementation of TQM practices  will be more strongly, positively related to hos-  pital performance.  Hypothesis 3. In a hospital characterized by a  greater focus on exploration in its structure,  the degree of implementation of TQMpractices  will be more strongly, positively related to hos-  pital performance.  METHODS  Data Collection  The study was conducted within a single indus-  try, general medical hospitals (Standard Industrial  Classification code 8062). By controlling for overall  industry effects, we were able to limit confounding  influences and focus on the key variables of inter-  est. In addition, TQM has been recommended to  the members of this industry as a strategy that will  assist them in dealing with their turbulent environ-  ment, although the degree of implementation has  varied considerably.  Both primary and secondary data were gathered  for the analysis. From a list of 55 standard metro-  politan statistical areas (SMSAs) in the United  States that contained at least 15 general hospitals,  we randomly selected 19 metropolitan areas. Then,  in the fall of 1996, we sent questionnaires to the  chief executive officer and the director of quality at  each of the 512 hospitals in these 19 SMSAs. Fi-  nally, we combined the survey data with secondary  information available for the responding hospitals.  We received at least one questionnaire from each  of 193 hospitals, achieving an overall response rate  of 38 percent. From 36 of these (19%), we received  questionnaires from both the CEO and the director  of quality; from 56 (29%), we only got back the CEO  questionnaire; and from 101 (52%), we only re-  ceived the questionnaire sent to the director of  quality. These responses resulted in a total of 229  returned surveys and an individual response rate of  22 percent.  In an effort to assess the potential for response  bias, we made comparisons across a number of  available variables for both the responding and the  nonresponding hospitals for the 19 SMSAs using  data from the 1995 American Hospital Associa-  tion's Annual Survey of Hospitals. The mean re-  sults for nonrespondents did not differ signifi-  cantly from those for respondents when we  compared assets, number of employees, profitabil-  ity, or services offered. As a result, there does not  appear to be systematic response bias in the finan-  cial and operating characteristics of the hospitals  sampled.  Variables and Measures  Organizational performance. Organizational fi-  nancial performance, adjusted for industry effects,  has been used as a proxy for the supranormal rents  associated with competitive advantage (Mont-  gomery & Wernerfelt, 1988; Powell, 1995). To en-  sure the completeness and timeliness of the infor-  mation, we obtained the principal measure of  performance for the study directly from the respon-  dents in our survey instrument. There are many  precedents in the literature for obtaining perfor-  mance information on a primary basis (e.g., Covin,  Slevin, & Schultz, 1994; Powell, 1995). The five-  item measure used in this study was adapted from  scales used by Powell (1995) and Ramanujam, Ven-  katraman, and Caraillus (1986). Specific items for  this scale are listed in the Appendix.  The coefficient of reliability for the perceived  performance measure was .90. To further verify the  reliability of this measure, we conducted a one-way  analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test the similarity  among the within-organization responses (Amason,  1996). The results revealed that the between-hospi-  tals variance was significantly greater than the  within-hospital variance (F = 3.80, p < .001), sug-  gesting substantial agreement among the within-  hospital respondents. Direct comparison was also  made across the five-item scales received from the  36 hospitals that had multiple respondents. On  these five-point scales, 93 percent of the responses  were exactly the same or within one category. As an  additional test, these responses were also split into  two groups, those from the directors of quality and  those from the CEOs. T-tests conducted on the  means of each of the performance items demon-  strated no significant differences between the two  groups.  To test the convergent validity of this perceptual  measure, we averaged the 1996 and 1997 returns on  assets (ROAs) relative to those of competitors for 57  hospitals in 6 of the 19 SMSAs in the original  sample. Data were obtained from the American  Hospital Directory database. The correlation be-  tween the two-year average archival ROA relative  to competitors and our perceptual performance  measure was significant (r = .40, p < .01).  In addition to the perceptual measure, we also  obtained each hospital's overall score from the lat-  est audit conducted by the Joint Commission on  Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations. This  industry-expert-rated measure is based on a compre-  hensive audit of 49 standards related to internal hos-  pital processes conducted once every three years.  Hospitals are under considerable institutional pres-  sure to perform well in these areas (Westphal et al., This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 15 Feb 2017 20:22:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2001 Douglas and Judge 161  1997). Thus, although this measure is not a direct  assessment of competitive advantage, it may be an  alternative proxy for measuring competitive advan-  tages gained through successful TQM programs (Coff,  1999). To more fully assess the relationship between  TQM and organizational performance, we tested the  hypotheses using both the perceived financial perfor-  mance measure and the industry expert rating of per-  formance.  TQM practices. The seven TQM practices exam-  ined in our analysis have been identified in recent  research (Dean & Bowen, 1994; Hackman & Wage-  man, 1995; Powell, 1995); the Appendix gives the  specific scales and items used. We sought to com-  prehensively gauge the degree to which TQM had  been implemented within an organization with  these 36 items. A factor analysis of the items con-  firmed the existence of seven factors. Each item  loaded on the expected scale, and eigenvalues  ranged from 0.91 to 17.5, with 72 percent of the  cumulative variation explained (p < .001). Reliabil-  ity coefficients (alphas) and one-way ANOVAs  were calculated; the alphas ranged from .85 to .92,  signifying that the scales were reliable. Further-  more, the F-tests associated with the one-way  ANOVAs for each of the scales were significant. In  sum, our scales appeared to demonstrate accept-  able psychometric properties.  We constructed the factor scores by averaging  each organization's item responses for the respec-  tive scales. These seven factor scores were then  subjected to a final factor analysis to determine if  the TQM construct represented one or more latent  variables. Both the principal components and max-  imum likelihood techniques provided similar re-  sults, with all seven of the variables loading on a  single factor. The eigenvalue for this factor was  4.89, which explained 70 percent of the variation.  Therefore, in our data set, only one factor was iden-  tified representing the construct of degree of TQM  practices adopted. We computed the aggregated  average of these seven variables to create the  TQM practices variable that was used in the sub-  sequent analysis. The coefficient alpha for this  scale was .93.  Organizational structure. To measure organiza-  tional structure, we adapted the seven-item scale  originally developed by Khandwalla (1977) and re-  cently used by Covin et al. (1994). The items were  factor-analyzed to verify the existence of two dis-  tinct factors representing control and exploration.  This analysis confirmed the existence of these two  factors in our data set. The first factor, structural  control, accounted for 46 percent of the variance,  with an eigenvalue of 2.29. The three items loading  on this factor measured the degree that the organi-  zational structure emphasized the control of proce-  dures, systems, and job descriptions. The reliability  associated with this scale was .66. The second fac-  tor, structural exploration, consisted of two items  measuring the exploration capability of the organi-  zations with respect to allowing the flow of finan-  cial and operating information throughout the or-  ganization and the freedom to depart from past  practices to adapt to a changing environment. This  factor had an eigenvalue of 1.06 and accounted for  21 percent of the variance. The reliability of this  scale was .67. Once again, the specific items used  are listed in the Appendix.  These two scales should be considered explor-  atory since this is the first study to use these two  distinct factors to represent the control and explo-  ration aspects of organizational structure. Khand-  walla's (1977) original scale demonstrated a reli-  ability of .68, similar to the ones exhibited by these  two scales. Nunnally (1978) considered this level of  reliability acceptable for the early or initial stages  of basic research. Future studies should increase  the number of items in each scale to increase their  reliability.  Control variables. Following prominent studies  of the hospital industry (e.g., Ketchen, Thomas, &  Snow, 1993), we used the number of hospital beds  as a proxy for organization size. We obtained these  data from the 1995 American Hospital Associa-  tion's Annual Survey of Hospitals.  Hospital ownership has also been recognized as a  potentially important variable in this industry. For-  profit and not-for-profit hospitals can be expected  to have different organizational goals and unique  groups of stakeholders (Zajac & Shortell, 1989).  Thus, it is important to classify each organization  into one of these two categories (1 = "for profit,"  2 = "not-for-profit"). These data were collected  from the 1996 edition of the Hospital Blue Book.  Since the market for resources is regional for  hospitals (Ketchen et al., 1993), it is important to  include a measure of market growth in the SMSA in  which the hospital operates. The growth rate for  each local market area was calculated using the  linear trend in the natural logarithm of the popula-  tion estimates. The population data (1991-95) were  obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau.  The level of competition in the hospital industry  may also influence organizational performance,  and it is measured at the local market area, or  SMSA. In line with recent research (Boyd, 1990),  we chose to use a Herfindahl index to measure this  construct in our study. Calculated using market  share data as input, the Herfindahl index repre-  sents perfect competition when it registers a score  of 0, and a score of 1 portrays a monopoly situation.

RESULTS  The descriptive statistics of the variables used in  the hypothesis tests are displayed in Table 1. The  collinearity diagnostics, including the variance in-  flation factors, all indicated that multicollinearity  was not a problem. In addition, Table 1 contains  the means and standard deviations of the seven  individual TQM practices detailed in the Appendix  along with their correlations relative to the two  performance variables.  Tables 2 and 3 show the results of hierarchical  regression analyses. Hypothesis 1 was tested by  comparing the increase in variance explained from  model 1 to model 2 (Tables 2 and 3). Model 1  represents the regression of the control variables on  the performance variable (perceived financial per-  formance in Table 2 and industry-expert-rated per-  formance in Table 3), and model 2 adds TQM prac-  tices to both sets of regressions. In each instance,  the test statistic (F; Cohen, 1968) for the change in  the multiple squared correlation statistic (R2) is  significant.  The results indicate that the degree of TQM prac-  tices implemented is positively and significantly  related to both the perceived financial performance  of a hospital (t = 2.93, p < .01) and its industry-  expert-rated performance (t = 2.00, p < .05). There-  fore, Hypothesis 1 is well supported by our data.  The results indicate that the degree to which TQM  practices are implemented is significantly related  to both of these measures of organizational perfor-  mance, providing evidence of the robustness of this  relationship.  To explore the moderating influence of organiza-  tional structure postulated in Hypotheses 2 and 3,  we created model 3 by adding the first-order inter-  actions between structural control and exploration  and TQM practices to model 2 for both perfor-  mance measures. The associated F-tests displayed  in Tables 2 and 3 signify that significant additional  variance is explained with respect to financial  performance in Table 2, but not with respect to  industry-expert-rated performance in Table 3.  Therefore, we found some empirical support for the  moderating impact of organizational structure with  respect to organizational performance, since each  of the two-way interaction terms, TQM with struc-  tural control (t = -2.88, p < .01) and TQM with  structural exploration (t = 2.19, p < .05), was sig-  nificant. These results partially support Hypothe-  ses 2 and 3.  To determine the exact nature of these moderat-  ing relationships identified in Table 2, we con-  ducted additional interpretative analyses. Using  standard graphical techniques, we found that hos-  pitals operating with relatively high structural con-  trol exhibited a stronger relationship between the  TQM practices implemented and financial perfor-  mance and that hospitals with relatively lax struc-  tural controls did not demonstrate a significant re-  Means, Standard Deviations, and Correlationsa  TABLE 1  Variable Mean s.d. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  1.

This finding  provides some tentative support for the arguments  of Sutcliffe et al. (1999), and it suggests that the  relationship between the degree of TQM imple-  mentation and financial performance is influenced  by levels of both structural control and exploration.  Our results suggested additional ad hoc analysis  in light of the work of Sutcliffe and colleagues  (1999). These researchers argued that control and  exploration processes may be "synergistic" within  an organization, signifying that these processes  may be interdependent and mutually reinforcing.  To test this possibility, we added a three-way in-  teraction term to model 3; the results appear as  model 4 in Tables 2 and 3. The three-way interac-  tion, TQM with control and exploration, is signifi-  cant and positive (t - 2.05, p < .05) for the finan-  cial performance equation, but it is not significant  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS  Theoretical Implications  This study has addressed whether the capabili-  ties generated by TQM are related to competitive  advantage. With respect to our principal hypothe-  sis, we found strong empirical support for a posi-  tive relationship between the degree of TQM im-  plementation and organizational performance. We  also found some empirical evidence that this rela-  tionship between TQM implementation and orga-  Conditional Effects on the Relationship between TQM Practices Implemented and Financial Performance  FIGURE 1  (la) Structural Control  5 - High Control  Financial ,, '  Performance , Low Control  3 . _ _  .0  2 3 4 5  TQM Practices Implemented  (lb) Structural Exploration  5 - High Exploration  4 -  Financial e Low Exploration  Performance  2  2 3 4 5  TQM Practices Implemented This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 15 Feb 2017 20:22:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2001 Douglas and Judge 165  nizational performance was moderated by organi-  zational structure.  The results of this study contribute to the rapidly  developing total quality management literature  (Westphal et al., 1997) in that it is the first large-  scale study to confirm the expected positive rela-  tionship between the degree of implementation of  TQM practices and overall organizational perfor-  mance. Recognizing that TQM practices develop  along different time frames within each organiza-  tion (Carmen et al., 1996), identification of the ex-  tent to which these practices have been imple-  mented throughout an organization allows for a  more complete understanding of TQM's value  (Hackman & Wageman, 1995). In short, TQM ap-  pears to be more than an either/or proposition. Our  study reveals that one important aspect of TQM  success is the degree to which the entire TQM  philosophy has been implemented; the rhetoric  that surrounds it and the mere presence of a TQM  program are not sufficient for success. For example,  one of the respondents from a hospital in Phoenix  reported that "although the top administrators give  CQI [continuous quality improvement] lip service,  their actions do not support it and few resources  are provided." Future researchers are encouraged  to include a measure of degree of implementation  when studying TQM programs.  Westphal and his colleagues (1997) have pointed  out that the information emanating from large-scale  empirical research on TQM has been scarce and  inconclusive. The most noteworthy exception is  Powell's (1995) study of 39 firms that implemented  some TQM practices. He found that although TQM-  adopting firms outperformed nonadopters, many of  the basic TQM practices failed to correlate directly  with organizational performance. We have built on  Powell's (1995) findings by examining the progress  that each studied hospital made "moving up the  experience curve" toward full implementation of a  comprehensive set of TQM practices. Notably, we  found that the hospitals that had more completely  implemented a comprehensive array of TQM prac-  tices outperformed those that had less well-devel-  oped programs.  Powell (1995) also wrote that complementary or-  ganizational resources might need to be in place for  some of the TQM practices to be effective, but he  did not empirically investigate this relationship.  Our study breaks new ground in the TQM literature  by identifying a complex relationship between or-  ganizational structure and TQM implementation  success. This finding supports recent conceptual  arguments that both control and learning are nec-  essary in order to take advantage of TQM in chang-  ing environments (Sitkin et al., 1994).  Hospitals that exhibited strong emphasis on  structural control of procedures, operations, and  work activities exhibited a stronger relationship  between their TQM implementation and financial  performance. This finding supports observations  made by Lillrank, Shani, Kolodny, Stymne,  Figuera, and Liu (1998) that continuous improve-  ment can effectively be integrated into an organiza-  tion via job descriptions and other administrative  procedures. By standardizing the use of specific  TQM tools and techniques within an organization's  formal procedures, it appears that hospitals can  continuously improve effectiveness and efficiency  (Shortell et al., 1995).  Hospitals that demonstrated a higher level of  structural exploration also displayed a stronger re-  lationship between TQM implementation and fi-  nancial performance. It appears that organiza-  tions that provide employees access to key  information and empower them to adapt their  processes to environmental changes are better  able to use TQM for competitive advantage. This  finding reinforces Hackman and Wageman's  (1995) arguments that TQM needs a strong learn-  ing environment in which to function since em-  ployees are expected to use data about their work  processes for continuous improvement.  Our findings also provide critical insights for the  recent dialogue on the need to balance both control  and learning within an organization (Eisenhardt &  Tabrizi, 1995; Sutcliffe et al., 1999). Not only did  we find that both structural concepts enhanced the  relationship between TQM implementation and fi-  nancial performance separately; we also found that  control and exploration appeared to work synergis-  tically to enhance this relationship even further.  Sutcliffe and colleagues (1999) presented three pos-  sible scenarios in their discussion of the need to  balance control and learning. The first portrays the  balance as antithetical, with emphasis on either  control or learning at the expense of the other. The  second scenario describes control and learning as  orthogonal concepts that are each important to or-  ganizations. The third scenario presents a synergis-  tic system whereby control and learning are mutu-  ally reinforcing. Sutcliffe and colleagues discuss an  example of a high-tech manufacturing firm that  demonstrated that breakthrough learning within  their TQM system could be quickly routinized into  their organizational processes for efficiency. Our  findings in the hospital industry provide some new  evidence that TQM-adopting organizations have  also experienced the synergistic effects of balanc-  ing structural control and learning.  The recent metaphor of jazz improvisation in  organizational theory (Weick, 1998) has heightened This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 15 Feb 2017 20:22:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  166 Academy of Management Journal February  our awareness that organizations must balance ap-  parently paradoxical processes in a manner that  allows them to continually adapt to their environ-  ments. Our finding with respect to the complemen-  tary impact of two seemingly opposing structure  variables supports the implications found in this  theoretical insight.  However, our conclusions must be tentative  about the moderating impact of structure on TQM  implementation success because we failed to find a  moderating effect of organizational structure on im-  plementation success for the industry-expert-rated  measure of performance. One possible explanation  for this nonfinding is that the financial perfor-  mance measure is a more valid and reliable proxy  of competitive advantage than the expert-rated-  performance measure. Buttressing this argument  are the high correlations (Table 1) between all  seven of the TQM practices and the financial per-  formance measure (average r = .29); only five of the  seven TQM practices were correlated with the ex-  pert-rated-measure, however (average r = .19). No-  tably, the two practices that were not correlated  were "customer driven" and "continuous improve-  ment"-both known to be critical to competitive  advantage (e.g., Dean & Bowen, 1994). Future re-  search should explore multiple performance mea-  sures in other industries to determine if our lack of  findings was due to the problems with our perfor-  mance measures or due to a more complicated re-  lationship than was explored in this study.  Managerial Implications  This study has important implications for manag-  ers. First, it encourages them to invest in the time and  resources necessary to implement comprehensive  TQM programs, not just selected aspects of TQM. It  also suggests that seven specific practices-top man-  agement team involvement, quality philosophy,  TQM-oriented training, customer-driven changes,  continuous improvement, management by fact, and  TQM techniques-appear to operate as an integrated  system.  Second, this study suggests the importance of  ensuring that a supportive organizational structure  is in place. Managers have been offered rather sim-  plistic structural prescriptions in the past (Eisen-  hardt & Tabrizi, 1995), but the evidence from this  study provides tentative support for the argument  that firms must balance both control and explora-  tion in order to use TQM in a way that is both  effective and efficient. An organization seems to  need to provide the structural mechanisms that  enable TQM techniques to be woven into its fabric  (Lillrank et al., 1998) while allowing for the devel-  opment and integration of new knowledge and  ways to create customer value (Grant, 1996). If  these things do not happen, firms may encounter a  situation in which TQM doesn't add value.  Limitations  Despite these encouraging results, several limita-  tions of this study should be emphasized. First, the  sampling frame limits the generalizability of the  results. The organizations in this study were drawn  from a single industry, general hospitals. Although  this sampling frame allowed us to control for global  environmental factors and to provide results for a  major service industry, it does limit the generaliz-  ability of results. Since health care involves life-  and-death decisions involving activities that are  often highly regulated, the insights gained here  about total quality practices may not apply to other  industries.  The two performance measures used in this  study must also be viewed within the context of the  hospital industry. The use of perceived financial  performance is appropriate for most industries, but  the industry-expert-rated measure is specific to the  hospital industry and represents a hospital's ability  to meet institutional demands. This industry-  specific measure appears to be little related to a  hospital's ability to earn superior rents, focusing  instead on the ability to achieve process objectives  ultimately related to appropriate patient care. Coff  (1999) presented strong arguments that rents asso-  ciated with competitive advantage can be shared  across multiple stakeholders. If this is true, then the  use of multiple performance indicators appropriate  for the industry under study, should be considered.  It may well be that the advantage attributable to  TQM may be appropriated across shareholders,  which would then be reflected in both traditional  and nontraditional measures of performance. This  potential outcome should be tested using alterna-  tive measures of performance, as was done in this  study. Therefore, it would be beneficial for future  research to look at other industries in order to val-  idate the above results in different settings.  Second, this study was cross-sectional. Although  the model developed from the theory implied cer-  tain causal relationships, the causality could not be  confirmed with our cross-sectional research design.  A longitudinal study would be beneficial in order  to confirm the directionality of the relationships  identified in our results.  Third, the concept of total quality management is  sufficiently diverse that it is difficult to compre-  hensively measure it (Steel & Jennings, 1992). We  measured the concept of teamwork indirectly as the This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 15 Feb 2017 20:22:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2001 Douglas and Judge 167  practice labeled "top management team involve-  ment." However, some scholars have argued that  teamwork throughout an entire organization is in-  tegral to the TQM philosophy (Hackman & Wage-  man, 1995). Thus, researchers conducting future  studies of TQM may want to assess teamwork more  explicitly and throughout entire organizations to  make this TQM implementation measure more ro-  bust.  Finally, the scales used to measure structural  control and exploration should be considered ex-  ploratory, given their modest reliability coefficients  and small number of items. In future studies using  these scales, use of additional items dealing with  structural controls and exploratory mechanisms  would increase the reliability of these two con-  structs.  Conclusions  Despite the limitations discussed above, the  study provides several important contributions to  the literature. Notably, it clarifies the relationship  between the degree of implementation of TQM  practices and organizational performance and ten-  tatively identifies complementary variables whose  synergistic effect enhances this relationship. The  study findings provide relatively robust support for  the aggressive adoption of TQM in its entirety. As  Hackman and Wageman (1995) suggested, total  quality management, properly implemented and  combined with the appropriate organizational vari-  ables, may be a vehicle that allows organizations to  dynamically maintain a fit with their environments  in a competitive and sustainable fashion.

APPENDIX  Questionnaire Items  TQM Practices  For the seven TQM practices, respondents indicated  the extent to which the items represented practices in  their organizations. (1 = "very low" to 5 = "very high")  for quality performance.  The goal-setting process for quality within the  health care organization is comprehensive.  Importance is attached to quality by the organi-  zation's top management in relation to cost objec-  tives.  Quality issues are reviewed in the organization's  top management meetings.  2. Quality Philosophy  There is a strong commitment to quality at all  levels of this organization.  People in this organization are aware of its overall  mission.  Members of this organization show concern for  the need for quality.  Continuous quality improvement is an important  goal of this organization.  Managers here try to plan ahead for changes that  might affect our performance.  3. Emphasis on TQM-Oriented Training  Quality-related training is given to hourly em-  ployees throughout the organization.  Quality-related training is given to managers and  supervisors throughout the organization.  Training is given in the "total quality concept"  (i.e., philosophy of company-wide responsibility  for quality) throughout the organization.  Training is given in the basic statistical tech-  niques (such as histograms and control charts) in  the organization as a whole.  The organization's top management is committed  to employee training for quality.  Resources are provided for employee training in  quality.  4. Customer Driven  Associates know who their customers are.  Associates attempt to measure their internal cus-  tomers' needs (customers inside this organization).  Associates attempt to measure their external cus-  tomers' needs (customers outside this organiza-  tion).  The organization uses customer requirements as  the basis for quality.  Our organization is more customer-focused than  out competitors.  5. Continuous Improvement  Associates in the organization try to improve the  quality of their service.  Associates in the organization believe that quality  improvement is their responsibility.  Associates in the organization analyze their work  products to look for ways of doing a better job.  1. Top Management Team Involvement  6. Management by Fact  The top health care organization executive as-  sumes responsibility for quality performance.  The major department heads participate in the  quality improvement process.  The organization's top management (top admin-  istrator and major department heads) has objectives  Quality data (defects, complaints, outcomes,  time, satisfaction, etc.) are available.  Quality data are timely.  Quality data are used as tools to manage quality.  Quality data are available to hourly workers.

Quality data are used to evaluate supervisor and  managerial performance.  7. Total Quality Methods  Associates use the basic statistical techniques  (such as histograms and control charts) to study  their work processes.  Associates analyze the time it takes to get the job  done.  Associates keep records and charts measuring the  quality of work displayed in their work area.  Structural Exploration  Highly structured channels of communication and  highly restricted access to important financial and oper-  ating information/Open channels of communication  with important financial and operating information flow-  ing quite freely throughout the organization.

Statistical techniques are used to reduce variation  Structural Control  in processes in the organization.  TQM procedures (such as brainstorming, cause-  and-effect diagrams, Pareto charts) are used to ana-  lyze information for process improvement.  Perceived Financial Performance  The scale represents the organization's performance  relative to competitors' over the last three years. (1 =  "much worse," to 5 = "much better")  Growth in earnings  Growth in revenue  Changes in market share  Return on assets  Long-run level of profitability  Structural Exploration and Control  For the structural exploration and structural control  items, a respondent was asked to identify the operating  management philosophy actually used in her or his  health care organization. A 1 represented the first state-  ment in each pair, and a 7 represented the second state-  ment, with 4 as the midpoint standing for a combination  of the two.  Strong emphasis on always getting personnel to follow  the formally laid down procedures/Strong emphasis on  getting things done even if this means disregarding for-  mal procedures.  Tight formal control of most operations by means of  sophisticated control and information systems/Loose, in-  formal control; heavy dependence on informal relation-  ships and norm of cooperation for getting work done.  Strong emphasis on getting line and staff personnel to  adhere closely to formal job descriptions/Strong ten-  dency to let requirements of the situation and the indi-  vidual's personality define proper on-job behavior.
