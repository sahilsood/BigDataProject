KEY WORDS: corporate reputation, social reputation,  business reputation  Introduction  Nowadays, a good corporate reputation is one ofthe  main business assets responsible of sustained financial  outcomes (Roberts and Dowling, 2002). This stra  tegic potential is due to its own value-creation  capability, and to its intangible character, because it  makes corporate reputation quite hardly to imitate by  competitors, aUowing to maintain a superior posi  tion. In the present day, we can state that business  management researchers and speciaUy researchers  from the Resource-Based View (Barney, 1986,1991;  Deephouse, 2000; Dierickx and Cool, 1989; Grant,  1991) have highlighted its strategic nature.  Although the intangible nature is a key charac  teristic in order to grant its relevance, it also makes  very hard to perform a conceptual delimitation,  characterization, and measurement (Deephouse,  2000). Corporate reputation holds a complex nature  (Barney, 1986; Dowling, 2001; Grant, 1991). Its  triggers are deeply rooted in the own organization,  and they are tied to its creation and evolution, in an  unique historicaUy dependent context (Dierickx and  Cool, 1989). Thus, corporate reputation becomes  highly specific for each firm. This can be one of the  main reasons because there are so little effort in  studying a conceptual and empirical delimitation of  this asset (Shenkar and Yuchtman-Yaar, 1997). In  this vein, we must highlight that most of the This content downloaded from 152.15.113.9 on Mon, 08 Jan 2018 16:43:42 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  362 Gregorio Martin de Castro et al.  empirical research that tries to relate corporate rep  utation and competitive advantage, the information  sources employed are mainly secondary (Deephouse,  2000; DeQuevedo, 2001). Among other things, this  fact is due to the problems that researchers find to  make it operative.  Taking into account these problems, this work  provides a conceptual delimitation of corporate  reputation, as weU as an identification of its main  dimensions: business reputation and social reputa  tion, and a measurement for it in order to determine  its nature empiricaUy, and to aUow its measurement.  In order to carry out this task, our work is built  upon the foUowing main sections: (i) conceptual  delimitation; (ii) identification ofthe main underly  ing dimensions: business reputation and social repu  tation; and (iii) the main conclusions ofthe study.  The notion of corporate reputation  Trying to conceptualize corporate reputation,  Shenkar and Yuchtman-Yaar (1997) provide a syn  thesis and comparison of how it has been treated from  the fields of Sociology, Marketing, Law, Accoun  tancy, Economics, and Business Management.  Within the field of Business Management, there are  several contributions around corporate reputation.  Although it has been a quite common topic in the  literature, there is no agreement about what does it  mean and what does it include. The work of  Groenland (2002) tries to give some guidelines, de  spite ofthe fact that the own author could found in its  empirical qualitative research (2002: 309), "corporate  reputation is, in its essence, a mainly emotional  concept that is difficult to rationalize and to explicit".  From the review of the different contributions  (Baden-FuUer et al., 2000; Deephouse, 2000; De  Quevedo, 2001; DoUinger et al., 1997; Fombrun,  1996; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Groenland,  2002; Petric et al, 1999; Rao, 1994; Shenkar and  Yuchtman-Yaar, 1997; Roberts and Dowling, 2002;  Weigelt and Camerer, 1988), as weU as from the  characteristics provided by Fombrun and Van Reil  (1997), we can pose that corporate reputation is the  result ofthe process of "social legitimization" ofthe  firm. In this sense, we can understand corporate  reputation as the coUective representation of actions  and outcomes of the past and present of the orga  nization, that describe its capability to obtain valu  able outcomes for different stakeholders.  The former definition is quite close to the one of  Barney's (1999), who remarks the characteristics tied  to organizational capabilities ? an unique historical  context, path dependence, social complexity, and  causal ambiguity. These characteristics make them  difficult to create or accumulate, and corporate rep  utation is pointed out as a clear example of aU of this.  The present reputation of a certain firm is built or  accumulated in a historical context and in unique  circumstances that surely can not be repeated.  Besides, as HaU (1992) argues, his survey among  British managers shows that firm reputation and  product reputation need several years to be shaped.  This makes clear that the reputation is one of the  most difficult to accumulate resources. Dierickx and  Cool (1989) argue that, in order to obtain a good  reputation, several decisions about operations,  quality, etc. are needed.  From the provided definition and the main  characteristics that it includes - causal ambiguity,  social complexity, slow accumulation, and path  dependence - we can find that corporate reputation  shows a high rate of tacitness and intangibility, and  this makes its identification and measurement reaUy  hard. We address this issue in the next section.  Social reputation and business reputation as  a key components of corporate reputation:  empirical evidence  Several authors highlight the complexity ? and the  multicHmensionality - of corporate reputation. Pre  cisely Barney (1999) argues that reputation is a  "sociaUy complex" capability. These sociaUy com  plex phenomena, as stated firstly in 1991, are out of  reach for firm ability in order to get a complete  influence and management, as Standifird (2001) says.  Deephouse (2000) points out that corporate repu  tation is developed through time, with a socially  complex process in which the firm and its stake  holders - internal and external - are involved.  In this sense, there are not agreements about its  conceptual delimitation. One of the most discordant  points refers to its multidimensionality (Fombrun and  Shanley, 1990). DoUinger et al. (1997) point out the  multidimensionality of this construct, identifying This content downloaded from 152.15.113.9 on Mon, 08 Jan 2018 16:43:42 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  Business and Social Reputation 363  three main components for reputation: managerial  reputation, financial reputation, and product repu  tation. These dimensions are independent and rep  resent different aspects of corporate reputation and  their role with different stakeholders.  From a Stakeholders Framework, another inter  esting proposal is due to De Quevedo (2001). In her  research, she highlights the existence of two main  dimensions of corporate reputation: internal repu  tation and external reputation. The first one is  related with the "business stakeholders" perception  of firm activities - workers, managers, shareholders,  customers, aUies, suppliers - and the second one is  related with the external stakeholders perception of  firm activities ? society in general. These findings are  similar to Deephouse's (2000) work.  The previous comments lead us to the determi  nation of the multidimensionality of corporate rep  utation as we have defined it, from the analysis ofthe  composition and relations of each of the elements  that configure corporate reputation (Fombrun,  1996; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). These elements  are: (i) managerial quality; (ii) financial strength; (iii)  product and service quality; (iv) innovation; (v) use  of corporate assets/efficiency; (vi) capability to  gather, develop, and retain talented people; (vii)  social responsibility among the community; and  (viii) value of long term investments.  With the purpose to deepen into the data about  the elements of corporate reputation we carried out  a survey. It was sent to CEO of Spanish biotech  nology firms. FoUowing Rouse and DaeUenbach  (1999), the use of a single industry is a necessary  condition to explore intrinsic and complex organi  zational factors responsible of business success.  During 2003 our field research reached a response  rate of 58% of the population (n=34 cases).  Then, we performed a factor analysis in order to  identify the configuration of those elements. The  correlation matrix (Table I) will show the appro  priateness of this analysis. As it can be clearly  appreciated, almost every correlation is positive,  strong and significant, which constitutes a first sign  of factor analysis appropriateness.  This appropriateness is supported by the Bartlett  test, which aUows to refuse the hypothesis that the  correlation matrix would be an identity matrix, and  the Kaiser?Meyer?Olkin index, holds a value near  to one (Table II). AU of these tests claim for the  appropriateness of factor analysis in this case.  Now we proceed to extracting the factor axis, as  weU as to interpret the results of Table III.

The results of Table III, as  weU as the high correlations among the elements of  reputation confirm the conclusions of Fombrun and  Shanley (1990), although they obtained a factor that  counts for the 84% of the standard deviation from  the elements of reputation according to Fortune data.  The previous results confirm the suspicions of  financial bias in measuring reputation, a traditional  issue in this kind of research (Brown and Perry,  1994; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; McGuire et al.,  1990). This financial halo or bias represents that the  assessments of the different elements of corporate  reputation are interpreted taking into account the  economic and financial performance of the firm.  bias can be assessed using the results shown in  Table III. As we have commented above, the eight  elements of corporate reputation contribute to an  only factor that explains almost the 69% of the  standard deviation ofthe original data. Although this  figure does not reach the 80% obtained by De  Quevedo (2001), we can conclude that there is a  clear sign of the existence of financial halo.  The first of these tests for detecting the financial  The other test that we use is the one proposed by  This bias comes from a homogeneous sample for  the survey.

With it we try to deter  mine the high and significant influence of past per  formance over the measure of present corporate  reputation.

The results of this work  show a portion of the standard deviation of the  dependent variable ? the set ofthe eight components  of corporate reputation - explained by the financial  halo index of 55%, higher than the detected by  McGuire et al. (1990) or Fombrun and Shanley  (1990). Nevertheless, the methodology developed  by Brown and Perry (1994) propose to perform nine  multiple regressions, one for each element of repu  tation, and one more for the global reputation of  each firm.  Because of the specific characteristics of Spanish  biotechnology industry, speciaUy because its emer  gent state (according to the Asebio Report 2002,  40% of firms are younger than 2-years-old, and none  ofthe firms ofthe sample was a public company), we  decide to create the index according to the foUowing  concepts: (i) average ROA ofthe last 2 years (2001  and 2000); (ii) 2001 sales log; (iii) medium increase  of sales during 2001 and 2000; and (iv) risk taken in  2001, measured as debts over total liabilities.  As a preliminary step to making the appropriate  multiple regression analysis, in Table IV we show the  correlations among the variables included in the study.  Then, in Table V, the results of the nine regres  sions performed (one for each component of repu  tation, and one for global reputation) are shown.  Each regression has been run over the total of our  sample, according to the foUowing general expres  sion for the regression equation:  Element = ft + ftAVROA + ftRISKOl  + ftSALELGOl + ftSALEINCR + e  Where, AVROA: average ROA during the years 2000  and 2001; RISK01: financial risk taken in 2001 (total  investment over total liabilities); SALELG01: 2001 sales  log; SALEINCR: the average sales increase in 2001 with  respect to 2000.  Lastly, we show the residue ofthe estimation that  represents the value of each component of corporate  reputation free from financial bias.  The results ofthe nine previous regressions show  a clear presence of financial halo, due to the fact that  every regression holds high regression coefficients,  significant for acceptance values (Table V). Those  values are coherent with the results obtained and  validated by Brown and Perry (1994).  Once the financial halo has been detected, we must  try to correct it. FoUowing the methodology proposed  by Brown and Perry (1994), once the financial halo has  been detected, with high and significant R , we must  eliminate it from the components of reputation. In  doing so, we accept that the residues obtained from the  regression, namely, the portion of component that is  not explained by the financial halo index, are the  measurement of the components of corporate repu  tation without financial halo.  From these residues or components without  financial halo, we run a new factor analysis to  determine the dimensions of corporate reputation  (see Table VI).  Then, we proceed to extract the factorial axis, as  weU as to discuss the results shown in Table VII.  FoUowing the factor weight pattern we wiU  interpret the obtained factors.  The first factor can be understood as the corporate  reputation related to the main issues of the core  business. This way, the component that holds a  higher correlation with this factor is product and  service quality, followed by the innovation degree of  the firm. Besides, this factor includes elements  related to investment value in the long run, the  efficiency in the use of corporate assets, and the  capability to attract, develop and retain talented  workers.  The second factor shows important weights of the  two variables or components that it includes:  financial strength, and social and green firm  responsibility. Once the financial bias has been  corrected, it seems coherent that social responsibility  will be apart from the rest of components of cor  porate reputation. The lack of separation between  this element and the rest was exactly the beginnings  of the debate about the presence and correction of  financial bias in the literature (Brown and Perry,  1994; DiUon et al., 1984). Thus, this result support  previous works and shows a new proof of bias cor  rection.  Nevertheless, there is an interesting issue about  the inclusion of this element in the second factor,  with financial strength. It seems appropriate of  financial strength to hold weak ties with the repu  tation about product and service quality, or with This content downloaded from 152.15.113.9 on Mon, 08 Jan 2018 16:43:42 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  ON  _ Si  _ Hi  CGMQ VILR CART PSQ FS INV UA_E CGSR RISKO01 AVROA SALELG01 SALEINCR  Element CONSTANT AVROA RISK01 SALELG01 SALEINCR F Corrected R2 ?

Nevertheless, to appear with firm  social responsibility can be explained. A priori,  according with the responses of the managers from  this industry, social and green responsibility was the  last element of corporate reputation ranked by rel  evance (it counted for 7% of global reputation).  Thus, managers wiU only aUocate resources to social  responsibility when financial surplus will be avail  able. This idea supports to include both elements  together in the second factor, that we named "social  reputation".  Business and Social Reputation 367  TABLE VI  KMO and Bartlett test  Kaiser?Meyer?Olkin measured 656  Bartlett test  Aprox. Chi-squared 73.990  FD 28  Sig. 000  The obtained results and its discussion confirm  the two dimensions of reputation obtained by De  Quevedo (2001) or just defended by Brown and  Perry (1994).  Once the two dimensions of corporate reputation  have been presented, we will discuss the validity and  reliability tests. Calculating Cronbach's a we can  check the reliability degree of the scale. The  obtained results show figures of 0.84 for the first  factor and of 0.87 for the second one. These results  are higher than the critical level of 0.70, required for  accepting the reliability of the scales.  Both empirical literature review about corporate  reputation, and in-deep interviews conducted with  industry experts and managers (the first stage of  fieldwork) provide content validity for the proposed  measures.  The second issue in determining complexity  degree, exogenous complexity, takes into account  the number of resources and capabilities that are  included in corporate reputation. The previous  paragraph and Figure 1 can justify this issue. In  testing it empiricaUy we can again use the correlation  coefficients, high and significant, among the differ  ent elements of "business reputation" (in the  example, we find a Pearson correlation coefficient of  0.794 between "corporate governance and mana  gerial quality" and "product and service quality",  and of 0.695 between "innovation" and "efficiency  in using corporate assets") and the two elements that  configure the second dimension, "social reputation"  (with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.782).  The complex nature of corporate reputation can be  seen graphicaUy in Figure 1.  The cornmented issues lead us to state that, from  an empirical point of view, corporate reputation  holds a high level of complexity. This makes of it  one of the more complex firm capabilities. Although  this characteristic has been extensively highlighted  by the authors of the Resource-Based View (Amit  and Schoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1986, 1991; Grant,  1991; Roberts and Dowling, 2002), our descriptive  analysis tests this point empiricaUy.  Conclusions: the business and social  dimensions of corporate reputation  This work presents an exploratory analysis of cor  porate reputation, focused on determining its key  dimensions empirically. Thus, according to other  theoretical approaches (stakeholders) and previous  works (Deephouse, 2000; DeQuevedo, 2001), we  have found two key components:  ? Business reputation, that includes the different  aspects of corporate reputation related to the  agents and stakeholders that appear closely  tied to the business activities and processes of  the firm, as customers, suppliers, managers or  employees.  From a theoretical perspective, we can affirm the  degree of tacitness embedded in both dimensions of  corporate reputation (business reputation and social  reputation). This fact lies in the own complexity of  the components that corporate reputation holds (in  example, corporate governance and managerial  quality, capability to attract and retain talented  employees, innovation, or social and green respon  sibility) and in the interrelations that appear among  these components (see Figure 1).  - Social reputation, which is the result of the in  sights and perceptions of other stakeholders  that are not so close to day by day business  activities, as investors and the community in a  wider sense.
