JOHNSON  University of Arkansas  DANIEL E. LOCKHART  University of Kentucky  A theory of turnover, social capital losses, and store performance was developed and  tested in 38 locations of a restaurant chain. We assessed the ability of social capital  losses to predict variance in store-level performance above and beyond that predicted  by overall turnover rate and in-role performance losses from turnover. We further  predicted that turnover rate and network density would moderate the curvilinear  relationship between social capital losses and performance. Results strongly sup  ported turnover rate's moderation of social capital losses: performance declines from  network disruptions were more apparent when overall turnover was low. The network  density interaction prediction was not supported.  The relationship between turnover and organiza  tional performance is viewed historically either  through human capital theory or cost-based lenses.  In recent years, however, researchers have begun to  take a broader view of the turnover-performance  relationship?one that encompasses the impact of  turnover on people's social relations with organi  zations (Dess & Shaw, 2001). This theoretical shift  is a function of the increasing value researchers and  organizations place on the development and reten  tion of social capital, which can be broadly defined  as assets embedded in relationships (Leana & Van  Buren, 1999). The implication is that turnover not  only erodes performance by depleting organization  al skill banks but, perhaps more dramatically, by  altering the social structure and fabric of an organ  ization. Dess and Shaw (2001) argued that the  downside risk exposure of social capital losses is  significant, especially in settings where communi  cation and resource leveraging are at a premium,  such as service- and knowledge-based organiza  tions. In such cases, the loss of key organization  members can severely damage an organization's  This study was funded by the SHRM Foundation.

To date, no  formal theory-based predictions or empirical evi  dence have been available to either confirm or re  fute these positions. To take steps in this direction  we (1) reviewed existing evidence that links turn  over rates to organizational performance, (2) ex  tended Dess and Shaw's (2001) initial organization  al social capital-based conceptualization of the  turnover-performance relationship, (3) and tested  our theory at 38 locations of an upscale, dinner  oriented restaurant chain where high-quality ser  vice and high food quality were deemed critical  factors for unit success.  The following boundary conditions apply to our  study. We derive macrolevel predictions concern  ing turnover, social capital losses, and performance  without addressing implications of turnover for the  social capital accumulations of individuals; that is,  we take a public-good view of social capital and a  macrolevel view of performance. Sacrificing some  external validity but minimizing sources of error,  our study is confined to a sample of facilities in a  single restaurant chain (see Glebbeek and Bax  [2004] for a similar approach). Doing so diminished  the possibility that differences in consumer prefer  ences, competition, and labor market conditions  could explain our results. The restaurants included  in this study tend to be located in very similar areas  (generally suburban shopping centers) and very  near clusters of similar restaurant chains. Third,  in our theory and tests we assumed that turnover This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:03:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2005 Shaw, Duffy, Johnson, and Lockhart 595  is an exogenous variable, although an alternative  perspective is that levels of performance cause  fluctuations in turnover. We acknowledge that  there are reciprocal effects, but direct (Glebbeek  & Bax, 2004) and indirect (Shaw, Gupta, & Delery,  2005) evidence suggests that the turnover??  performance relationship is stronger than the re  verse. Fourth, we focus on a single network (com  munication) and a structural aspect of social  capital loss (loss of "structural hole bridges"  through turnover), although other networks (e.g.,  friendship) and aspects of social capital losses  (e.g., trust) may be relevant.  BACKGROUND AND THEORY  Traditional Views of Turnover Rates and  Performance  Osterman (1987) concluded that there was a rea  sonably strong, negative relationship between turn  over and productivity and argued that the findings  supported human capital theory. Human capital  accumulations (firm-specific "KSAs") in the aggre  gate increase the ability of a workforce to perform  effectively; that is, higher levels of in-role perfor  mance are the outcome of human capital accumu  lations. Turnover creates aggregate firm-specific in  role performance deficits and therefore negatively  relates to performance, according to the human  capital view (e.g., Batt, 2002). Beyond these effects,  higher turnover is part of a more generic problem of  organizational control (Alexander, Bloom, & Nu  chols, 1994). High turnover causes organizations to  neglect the activities necessary to produce basic  output and redirect energy and resources away  from maintenance and safety concerns, lowering  in-role performance in the process (Price, 1977;  Shaw et al., 2005). Although there is some debate  on the form of the negative relationship between  turnover and performance (i.e., linear or curvilin  ear), the few macrolevel empirical studies in the  pertinent literature show generally detrimental ef  fects on efficiency (Alexander et al., 1994), produc  tivity (Brown & Medoff, 1978), sales growth (Batt,  2002), and safety (Shaw et al., 2005). Thus, the  traditional view of the turnover-performance rela  tionship is that turnover rates and organizational  performance are negatively related and that in-role  performance losses in a workforce account for  much of?that is, mediate?this relationship. Thus:  Hypothesis 1. There is a negative relationship  between a store's overall turnover rate and  store performance.  Hypothesis 2. In-role performance losses medi  ate the relationship between overall turnover  rate and store performance.  A Social Capital Theory of Turnover Rates and  Performance  Social capital theory was developed to explain  the value in social relationships inherent in net  works. Broadly defined as an asset embedded in  relationships (Leana & Van Buren, 1999), social  capital is developed when relationships facilitate  instrumental action among people (Coleman,  1988). Social capital can benefit individuals (a pri  vate-good view) by, among other things, increasing  their probability of promotion and career success  (Burt, 1992; Seibert et al., 2001), but it can also  benefit organizations (a public-good view) by in  creasing communication efficiency, "associabil  ity," and employee trust (e.g., Leana & Van Buren,  1999). These authors further argue that organiza  tional social capital can increase performance by  enhancing commitment, increasing flexibility, and  fostering intellectual capital.  We take the latter view here, looking at social  capital at the collective level. Adler and Kwon re  ferred to collective social capital as "a bonding  form" of social capital comprising "internal ties  within collectivities" (2002: 19). If social capital at  the collective level is created when relationships  facilitate instrumental action among people  (Coleman, 1988), it is also lost when these relation  ships among people are dissolved. Burt argued that  the withdrawal of involved parties from a "connec  tion dissolves with it whatever social capital it  contained" (1992: 58). Of particular interest here is  retention of intraorganizational communication  network links that allow information to flow freely  and efficiently throughout a network. These con  nections, which are commonly referred to as struc  tural hole bridges (Burt, 1992, 2000), allow organi  zation members to exchange resources and manage  knowledge effectively (Tsai & Ghoshal, 1998). With  regard to turnover and performance at the organi  zational level, these types of connections are more  important than the absolute size of employees' net  works because structural hole bridges are nonre  dundant links (Burt, 1992). Our view of social cap  ital at the collective level concerns the number of  structural holes that are bridged rather than the  absolute number of links that employees have. In  terms of information flow and efficiency, the loss  through turnover of employees with many redun  dant communication links in a network should not  be as damaging to overall organizational perfor  mance as the loss of employees who happen to This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:03:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  596 Academy of Management Journal August  bridge many otherwise open communication links  in the network.  Although the structural hole bridge concept is  typically viewed from a private-goods perspective,  its parallel value at the aggregate level is also clear.  Structural hole bridges provide advantages to the  collective by increasing the efficiency and effec  tiveness of communication flow and information  exchange (Burt, 2000). A structural hole bridge  links previously unconnected individuals in a net  work, increasing information flow in the network  in toto as well as its operational efficiency. Burt  labeled these increases the "performance effect" of  organizational social capital (2000: 411). Tsai and  Ghoshal (1998), for example, found that structural  hole bridges were positively correlated with prod  uct innovations in business units.  Thus, if social capital can be construed as a prop  erty of intraorganizational networks (Adler &  Kwon, 2002), if social capital is also a value created  by instrumental relationships among people (Cole  man, 1988), and if the more critical links in net  works are nonredundant or bridging ones (Burt,  1992), turnover among individuals who occupy  these network positions should be more damaging  to organizational performance than turnover among  individuals who occupy less central network posi  tions. This theory of social capital losses should be  viewed as a supplementing, rather than competing  with, the existing perspective on the turnover-per  formance relationship. As such, incurred social  capital losses from turnover should go over and  above the losses organizations experience in real  tion to in-role performance (human capital losses)  or other inefficiencies as a predictor of perfor  mance. Dess and Shaw (2001) provided the exam  ple of an organization losing a group of long-ten  ured employees under the traditional and social  capital perspectives. Under existing approaches,  the losses to the organization would amount to the  in-role performance deficits of the departed and  replacement employees as well as administrative  inefficiencies. The criticality of the network posi  tions of departed employees is argued to explain  variation in performance above and beyond the  performance variation explained by traditional  approaches.  Dess and Shaw (2001) further stated that the re  lationship between social capital losses and organ  izational performance is curvilinear, but they did  not clearly specify the curvilinear relationship. We  propose that the relationship will take the form of  an attenuated "U." Performance decline should be  more severe for organizations with moderate social  capital losses from turnover than for those with  high social capital losses, and it should be the most  severe for organizations with no social capital  losses from turnover. The effects of the loss of  structural hole bridges should be more pronounced  when turnover creates the first communication  gaps in a network than after numerous communi  cation gaps have been created.  It is useful to compare this formulation to a linear  or monotonie negative relationship. Assume that  we are observing performance decline in two pairs  of organizations. The first paired comparison (A) is  of an organization with very low social capital  losses from turnover (two standard deviations be  low the mean; -2 s.d.) to an organization with -1  s.d. social capital losses. The second comparison  (B) includes an organization with +1 s.d. social  capital losses and one with +2 s.d. social capital  losses. In the linear formulation, the predicted per  formance decline between the organizations in sit  uation A and situation B would be identical?that  is, the incremental effect on organizational perfor  mance remains constant over the range of social  capital loss. The curvilinear formulation suggests  that the decline in performance will be much  greater in situation A, where social capital losses  create the first gaps in the communication network,  than in situation B, where many structural hole  bridges have been lost in both cases. Comparing  zero to moderate social capital losses across organ  izations, a linear formulation would underestimate  the effect of such losses on performance. Compar  ing moderate to high social capital losses across  organizations, the linear formulation would over  estimate their effect. Figure 1 shows the slopes for  both a linear relationship and our hypothesized  curvilinear relationship. Formally:  Hypothesis 3. Social capital losses and store  performance have a curvilinear relationship  that is strongly negative initially but attenu  ated at higher levels of social capital loss.  Turnover and Density Moderators  We expected two variables?overall turnover  rate and communication network density?to mod  erate the curvilinear relationship of social capital  losses and store performance. With regard to over  all turnover, we expected the relationship between  social capital losses and performance to be more  pronounced when overall turnover rates are low  than when they are high. Social capital accumu  lates in intraorganizational networks over time. In  dividuals in long-standing groups develop "trans  active" and "external" memory (e.g., Wegner, 1987)  and norms of reciprocity that reduce opportunistic  behavior (Coleman, 1990). Although individuals This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:03:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2005  Shaw, Duffy, Johnson, and Lockhart  FIGURE 1  597  Social Capital Losses and Store Performance: Negative Attenuated and Linear Relationships  High  Store  Performance  ypothetical linear relationship  Hypothesis 3:  Negative attenuated  curvilinear relationship  Low  Low  may eagerly bridge structural holes both when  "voluntary turnover" is low and when it is high, the  loss of such boundary spanners should have more  of an impact when turnover is low?and thus,  transactive memory and reciprocity norms are  well-established?than when turnover is high, and  so key network relationships have not been steadily  maintained. High turnover can disrupt social sys  tems to the point at which it is difficult to effec  tively stabilize social exchanges (Coleman, 1990).  As a result, losses of bridging ties in organizations  where turnover is high may be less damaging than  the same losses in organizations where turnover is  low. As Dess and Shaw pointed out, "Organizations  suffer disproportionate losses when individuals  who are successful in creating social capital via the  maintenance and augmentation of network rela  tionships throughout the organization leave the or  ganization" (2001: 451). To summarize, we ex  pected an interaction between social capital losses  and overall turnover in predicting store perfor  mance. Thus:  Hypothesis 4. Social capital losses and overall  turnover rate interact in predicting store per  formance: the curvilinear relationship between  social capital losses and performance is stron  ger when the turnover rate is low.  Social Capital Losses  High  The density of a communication network should  also moderate the relationship between social cap  ital losses and store performance. Scott (2000) de  fined density as the number of relationships in a  group relative to the number of possible relation  ships. At the sociological level, density provides an  estimate of the number of redundant relationships  in a network. Organizations may reap some advan  tages from dense communication networks. For ex  ample, Sparrowe, Liden, Wayne, and Kraimer  (2001) argued that groups should realize greater  cooperation, information sharing, and accountabil  ity in dense networks. In the case of our study,  while density might relate positively to store per  formance, we also expected it to buffer the negative  effects of social capital losses on store performance.  Key links lost through turnover should lower per  formance across the board, but a surfeit of redun  dant contacts should ameliorate these negative  effects. Density increases information sharing ac  countability, which heightens the probability that  employees are aware of each other's roles in an  organization (Sparrowe et al., 2001). Accumulated  knowledge of the roles that other employees are  playing increases flexibility and adaptability, and it  should increase the speed at which organizations  respond to structural holes created by turnover.

In the  case of social capital losses, not only will knowl  edgeable individuals be able to respond to network  disruptions, but also, the abundance of redundant  relationships in a dense network should allow  changes to be made without a spiral of communi  cation gaps. In contrast is the effect of social capital  losses in a network with few redundant relation  ships. Under these conditions, the effect of social  capital losses on performance should be more pro  nounced; the losses should create an additional  strain on scarce communication links and may be  gin a chain reaction of communication problems  throughout the network. Thus:  Hypothesis 5. Social capital losses and net  work density interact in predicting store per  formance: the curvilinear relationship between  social capital losses and performance is stron  ger when density is low.  METHODS  Sample  The data for this study were obtained from 70  domestic store locations of an international restau  rant chain. The restaurants are relatively upscale,  dinner-oriented establishments that tend to be lo  cated in very similar commercial settings (near  other, similar restaurants and shopping establish  ments) across the United States. High standardiza  tion across the units and the placement of the units  in very similar commercial settings help to mini  mize the effects of consumer preferences and other  local market differences that could have biased the  results. Unlike fast-food restaurants, which com  pete using systematic and technological ap  proaches to food service and in which the impor  tance of social and human capital is low, our  setting was appropriate for examining social and  human capital issues in the context of turnover and  performance. The setting, however, made for a  somewhat tough test of the theory because social  and human capital losses are likely less problem  atic in this setting than parallel losses in settings  characterized by very high skill levels or knowl  edge intensivity (e.g., communities of scientists,  product development or software design teams,  etc.). Findings in support of our theory in this set  ting may suggest greater effects in stronger settings  (Prentice & Miller, 1992).  Data sources were collected or obtained from  four sources: employee surveys, supervisor perfor  mance evaluations, turnover records, and store  sales records. AU employees in the 70 facilities  were provided a questionnaire to complete during  work time, guaranteed confidentiality, and assured  that their participation was voluntary. The ques  tionnaire included attitudinal and demographic  information as well as sociometric forms for the  network variables. Each employee received a num  bered roster of all current store employees that  matched a sociometric form inside the question  naire. At the same time, supervisors completed a  short employee evaluation form provided by the  research team for all employees in the store. Turn  over information was provided by store managers  using store records six months following the col  lection of the survey data. Store sales data were  provided by corporate headquarters for the four  fiscal-year quarters preceding and following the  turnover data collection.  In all, 3,290 employees in these 70 stores com  pleted questionnaires, for an overall response rate  of 66.2 percent. Response rates across stores ranged  from a low of 21 percent to a high of 100 percent.  Because social network calculations require high  response rates, it was necessary to eliminate stores  with lower response rates. We attempted to main  tain an acceptable average response rate (typically  suggested in the literature to be 80 percent or more)  and also to look for a natural break point in the  response rates. Using these related criteria, we  eliminated from the analysis sample all stores with  lower than 65 percent response rates, as there was  a substantial drop in response rates below the cut  off, and this cutoff yielded an average response rate  of 80 percent. The analysis sample includes 38  stores and responses from 2,198 employees. The  average age of the analysis sample members was 24  years; the average tenure was 2 years; and the  modal education level was "graduated from high  school or G.E.D." The sample contained 73 percent  "white non-Hispanic" individuals, 13.7 percent  "Hispanic," and 7 percent "black non-Hispanic."  Sixty-two percent of the sample worked in the front  of the restaurant (e.g., as servers, hosts, or bartend  ers); 32 percent worked in the kitchen; and 6 per  cent held managerial jobs.  Measures  Turnover rates. We operationalized turnover  rate as the number of individuals who left a store  divided by the total number of employees in the  store. The average turnover rate for the six-month  collection period was 46 percent (a 92 percent rate,  if annualized), and the range was 26 percent to 70  percent. Turnover rates were approximately 49 per  cent for "front-of-house" and kitchen employees This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:03:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2005 Shaw, Duffy, Johnson, and Lockhart 599  during the six-month period and approximately 40  percent for managers.  In-role performance losses. We calculated this  variable using the aggregated in-role performance  measure completed by store managers. The four  items were adapted to the restaurant context from  the supervisor evaluation measure in a publication  of the Survey Research Center (1977). The items  were, "How good is the quality of this employee's  performance?", "How efficiently does this em  ployee do his or her work?", "When changes are  made to procedures, schedules, and menus, how  quickly does this employee adjust to them?", and  "How well does this employee cope with situations  that demand flexibility?" The items had 11 re  sponse options with bipolar anchors (e.g., "very  poor quality "/"very good quality," "very ineffi  ciently "/"very efficiently," "very slowly "/"very  quickly," and "very poorly"/"very well"). The in  ternal consistently reliability of this measure was  .94. The in-role performance level of all employees  in the store and the performance level of departed  employees were mean-aggregated to the store level.  To account for baseline performance differences  among stores and to standardize this measure for  cross-store comparison, we used a ratio: the average  in-role performance of leavers divided by the aver  age in-role performance of all employees in a store.  Social capital losses. We used Freeman's (1979)  "betweenness centrality" as a measure of the extent  to which individuals occupied structurally advan  tageous positions in a store's communication net  work?that is, bridged structural holes. We chose  this operationalization over constraint formulas be  cause use of betweenness allows one to take both  direct and indirect ties into account when deter  mining the value of an individual's position. We  symmetrized the communication matrices using  the "max-of" rule; that is, a pair was considered to  have a communication tie if either member of the  dyad indicated a communication tie existed. Using  the roster and the sociometric form, employees in  dicated whether or not they communicated with  other employees "at least several times a week." As  with the in-role performance loss measure, we ag  gregated the betweenness scores to the store level  for the entire employee group and for leavers. We  divided the betweenness scores for the leavers by  the betweenness score for the entire employee  group in order to standardize the measure for cross  store analyses. Thus, the ratio of the two (average  betweenness of leavers divided by the average  betweenness centrality in a store) was the  measurement.  Density. We used the formula provided by Scott  (2000) for this variable: the number of communica  tion ties in a network divided by n X [n - 1), where  n is the number of employees in the network.  Store performance. We measured store perfor  mance in three different ways. First, we calculated  the productivity metric that is common in sales and  other service organizations: sales per employee  (e.g., Huselid, 1995; Shaw et al., 2005). The mea  surement was average quarterly sales for the four  fiscal-year quarters following the turnover mea  surement divided by the number of employees in a  store. Following Batt (2002), we also included two  performance change measurements, change in pro  ductivity and change in sales, as dependent vari  ables. Change in productivity was average quarterly  sales per employee for the year following the turn  over measurement minus average quarterly sales  per employee in the year preceding the study.  Change in sales was actual dollar change in sales  during these same time periods.  Our choice of dependent variables was based on  several theoretical, contextual, and pragmatic con  cerns. Our theory concerning turnover and social  capital losses should relate not only to static levels  of performance, but also to changes in performance  levels in the periods immediately following the  losses. Thus, it was important not only to assess  productivity levels in the time period following the  collection of the independent variables, but also to  assess performance changes over time. We chose to  focus on sales or revenue (as opposed to costs or  profits) for theoretical and contextual reasons.  Sales is a critical performance outcome in service  industries and high-customer-contact settings  (Batt, 2002), as well as in highly competitive envi  ronments such as the restaurant industry. The units  of the restaurant chain examined here competed on  the basis of food and service quality in their market  niche?that is, it was not a fast-food chain. Sales  were the basis for performance evaluations at the  unit level as well as for performance comparisons  of stores at the corporate level. To emphasize its  importance and centrality in the culture, corporate  management repeatedly requested that all store  level feedback from the research team to store and  corporate officials be expressed in terms of quar  terly sales. Moreover, costs were relatively invari  ant across the chain owing to high standardization  in distribution, and they varied nearly perfectly  with store size. Thus, expressing variation in sales  over time as a function of differences in sales per  formance was, in our judgment, a legitimate ap  proach. We decided to use total employees as the  denominator in the productivity calculation be  cause of total employees' prevalence in the litera  ture and because of availability. Alternative mea  sures of store size (e.g., square feet per store) were This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:03:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  600 Academy of Management Journal August  not available to the research team. Corporate man  agement, however, assured us that square footage  and other size assessments varied almost perfectly  with employees per store.  Control variable. We controlled for store size  (number of employees) in all analyses. Store size  relates to the density of store networks and bridging  ties (Scott, 2000), turnover (Shaw, Delery, Jenkins,  & Gupta, 1998), and sales.  Analysis  We used hierarchical regression analyses to test  our hypotheses. We entered store size, turnover  rates, in-role performance losses, and density in  step 1, social capital losses in step 2, the quadratic  social capital loss variable (social capital losses  squared) in step 3, and the interactions (social cap  ital losses with turnover rates and social capital  losses with density, respectively) in the final  step. Unstandardized regression coefficients and  changes in explained variance were examined. To  reduce nonessential collinearity, we standardized  the variables (turnover, social capital losses, and  density) prior to creating the product terms (Cohen,  Cohen, West, & Aiken, 2003). Checks for the viola  tions of the assumption of our regression analyses  yielded no substantive violations.  RESULTS  Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics for, and  correlations among, the study variables. The top  panel in Table 2 includes the regression results  when productivity (sales per employee) is the de  pendent variable. In model 1, the turnover rate is  significantly and negatively related to productivity  [b = -1,464, p < .01), but in-role performance  losses are not significantly related [b = -134, n.s.).  Thus, Hypothesis 1 is supported. There is no sup  port for the mediating role of in-role performance  losses stated in Hypothesis 2, as they are not sig  nificantly associated with the turnover rate (Table  1, r = .09, n.s.) or productivity (Table 2, b = -134,  n.s.). Thus, neither of the critical conditions for  mediation is met. In model 3, the squared social  capital losses variable is significant in the expected  direction [b = 396, p < .05), but support for Hy  pothesis 3 is qualified by the higher-order interac  tion involving the quadratic social capital loss term  [b = -1,152, p < .01) in model 4 (Cohen et al.,  2003). The two interaction terms in model 4 ex  plain an additional 13 percent of the variance in  productivity.  Recall that Hypothesis 4 states that the negative  curvilinear relationship between social capital  losses and store performance is more pronounced  when turnover is low. The curvilinear relationship  is predicted to be such that as social capital losses  increase from low to average levels, the slope of the  line becomes steeper than that of a predicted linear  relationship, but this steepness attenuates as social  capital losses increase beyond mean levels. We  used the unstandardized coefficients to plot the  relationships and to assess the level of support for  Hypothesis 4. Figure 2 shows this relationship. As  expected, the highest level of performance is ob  served when social capital losses and turnover are  at their lowest levels. Moreover, the figure shows  strong support for Hypothesis 4 when turnover is  low. With low turnover, the relationship between  social capital losses and performance is strongly  negative as the first losses in social capital occur  across organizations, but it is attenuated at higher  loss levels. To illustrate, the predicted productivity  when social capital losses are -1.5 s.d. from the  mean is $17,653 generated per employee per quar  ter, but the predicted level is $13,970 per employee  at -1 s.d., a predicted 26.3 percent drop in produc  tivity. The predicted reduction in productivity de  cline between -1 s.d. and -.5 s.d. is 24 percent, and  the decline attenuates to 19 percent between ?.5  TABLE 1  Correlations and Descriptive Statistics3  Variables  Mean  s.d.  1.

Also as expected,  the relationship between social capital loss and  store performance is not as pronounced when  turnover is high; that is, there is a slightly posi  tive, but not significant, relationship across the  range of social capital losses. Thus, Hypothesis 4  receives considerable support in the productivity  equation. Hypothesis 5 is not supported. Neither  of the interaction terms containing network den  sity and social-capital-loss variables (see model  5) was significant.  The middle and lower panels in Table 2 in  clude the regression coefficients that result when  change in productivity and change in sales are  the dependent variables, respectively. These  analyses offer no support for Hypotheses 1 and 2  as neither the turnover rate nor in-role perfor  mance losses are significantly related to the  change outcomes in model 1. In both cases, the  quadratic term for the social capital loss term in  model 3 is significantly related to the change  outcomes, indicating the curvilinear relationship  predicted in Hypothesis 3, but this support is  again qualified by the higher-order interactions  High  (+l s.d.)  Social Capital Losses  Low Turnover Rate  High Turnover Rate  involving the quadratic social capital loss terms  in model 4 (Cohen et al., 2003).  In the productivity change equation, the model 4  interaction step explains an additional 25 percent  {p < .01) of the variation. Importantly, the interac  tion between the quadratic social capital loss term  and turnover is significant, with a sign in the ex  pected direction [b = -1,413, p < .01). In the  change in sales equation, the interaction step ex  plains an additional 26 percent [p < .01) of the  variation and the sign on the significant quadratic  social capital loss by turnover rate interaction,  again in the expected direction [b = -108,620, p <  .01). Plots of these relationships reveal patterns  similar to that found in Figure 1. The most positive  performance changes are observed when social  capital losses and turnover are both low. When  turnover is low, the attenuated relationship be  tween social capital losses and performance  changes in such a way that the most dramatic per  formance decrements occur when social capital  losses increase from low to moderate levels. When  turnover is high, the relationship between social  capital losses and performance changes is insignif  icant in both equations. It should also be noted that  when turnover rates are high, performance changes  are negative?there is a net loss in dollars?over  the entire range of social capital losses.

Building on earlier essays  (e.g., Dess & Shaw, 2001), we developed and tested  a theory with these elements: social capital losses  explain variation in store performance that exceeds  variation attributable to turnover and in-role per  formance losses; the relationship between social  capital losses and turnover is curvilinear; and turn  over and communication network density moder  ate that curvilinear relationship. The results of this  study are very encouraging with respect to the role  that social capital losses play in the performance of  organizations.  The data show that turnover rates and in-role  performance losses were not consistent predictors  of performance at the macro level. In the most  directly comparable study in the literature, Batt  (2002) found that a one-unit increase in turnover  was associated with a 17 percent reduction in sales  in a sample of call centers. In our results, turnover  was significantly related only to sales per em  ployee, with a one-unit increase in turnover asso  ciated with a $1,464 loss in quarterly sales per  employee. This result, however, should be inter  preted with caution because of the nonsignificant  results in the change-in-sales and change-in-pro  ductivity equations as well as the significant high  er-order interactions with social capital losses.  Contrary to our expectations, the relationship be  tween in-role performance losses and store perfor  mance was not significant, and there was no evi  dence that in-role performance losses mediated the  relationship between turnover and performance.  The restaurant industry generally experiences high  turnover, and it is possible that human capital is  more interchangeable in this context than in other  contexts. This factor may render the relatively high  losses of in-role performance, on balance, to be less  predictive than the turnover rate and other factors  (e.g., social capital) in this context. Dess and Shaw  (2001) argued that as the focus of an industry  changes from the allocation of labor and physical  capital to the leveraging of intellectual and infor  mational processes, relationships and social capital  take on greater importance. Our sample of service  firms provides some initial evidence to substantiate  this argument.  The primary feature of our theory and empirical  tests was examination of whether social capital  losses could go over and above turnover and in-role  performance losses in explaining variation in store  performance. We found, as expected, that the rela  tionship between social capital losses and store  performance was curvilinear and also that turnover  moderated it. When turnover was high, store per  formance was low across the board. When turnover  was low, the social capital loss-*performance rela  tionship was sharply negative initially, but it grew  attenuated as social capital losses increased. We  conceptualized and measured social capital losses  at the level of the collective, viewing social capital  as created when relationships facilitate instrumen  tal action among people (Coleman, 1988) and lost  when turnover disrupts communication networks  and hinders instrumental action. Our results show  that when turnover and social capital losses are  low, store performance is high, but as these losses  increase, the impact on store performance is  marked. Yet the incremental negative effect of so  cial capital losses grows less pronounced as these  losses increase. These findings provide a new di  rection for macrolevel turnover research. They sug  gest that turnover not only increases inefficiencies  in organizations and costs them in terms of human  capital deficits, but also that turnover costs organ  izations in terms of lost relationships among people  (Burt, 1992). Estimating the turnover-performance  association is not simply an accounting exercise,  but also a function of the embedded communica  tion networks in organizations and, especially, a  function of the individuals who hold critical bridg  ing positions in them. In large part, network re  searchers have focused on the consequences of in  tact social networks or the creation of certain  network patterns; few have examined the conse  quences of network disruptions. Moreover, the few  studies that have done so (e.g., Krackhardt & Porter,  1986; Shah, 2000) have looked at individual-level  outcomes rather than consequences for organiza  tional performance. Our study is among the first to  examine how losses of individuals in key network  positions can negatively impact the performance of  organizations. It should also be noted that our re  search context could be considered a weak situa  tion for the tests of these hypotheses. Coleman  (1988), among others, has argued that social capital  takes a significant amount of time to accumulate,  and Dess and Shaw (2001) argued that it is most  important in knowledge-intensive industries. Al  though the focal units here compete on the basis of  food and service quality, the importance of network  connections is likely more important in other indus  trial contexts (e.g., product development or design  teams, top or upper-echelon management teams,  etc.). In addition, that we observed strong social cap  ital loss effects among units that were experiencing  an annualized turnover rate of about 90 percent may This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:03:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  604 Academy of Management Journal August  also speak to the possibility of very powerful social  capital loss effects in stronger settings.  Several interesting areas for future research are  evident. First, taking a collective point of view, we  analyzed the disruption associated with losses of  individuals who are bridging structural holes in the  communication network. Although it is consistent  with existing views of social capital at the individ  ual and collective levels, our definition was not  intended to be a comprehensive view of network  losses. Krackhardt and Porter (1986), for example,  found that individuals in structurally equivalent  positions were more likely to leave their jobs in  clusters. Their focus was not examining conse  quences of turnover clusters, but rather, predicting  them. As such, the impact of structurally equiva  lent clusters of turnover on organizational perfor  mance is still unknown and should be examined in  future studies. Second, we analyzed social capital  losses in terms of the communication networks in  organizations, but social capital may be created and  lost in other types of networks (e.g., friendship or  advice networks; Shah, 2000; Sparrowe et al.,  2001). Shah (2000), for example, found that losses  of others from a focal individual's friendship net  work through downsizing had a greater impact on  the individual's attitudes and negative reactions to  the downsizing than losses of structural equiva  lents in the individual's network. In the case of  organization-level turnover research, it is possible  that losses of structural hole bridges may affect  performance directly, but losses of friendship ties  may influence collective performance through their  impact on individual's attitudes. In the case of ser  vice-oriented businesses like the ones examined  here, negative attitudes may impact performance  by reducing customer service and food quality or  by creating a snowball turnover effect. Third, al  though our predictions regarding interactions of  social capital losses and network density were not  supported, we encourage future research in this  area. In particular, research scholars should ex  plore the alternative ways in which social capital is  created and lost in organizations. Coleman (1988)  emphasized the role of cohesive ties in facilitating  cooperation, while Burt (1992) emphasized the role  of structural hole bridging. In support of Coleman's  view, we found that density positively related to  performance across the board, but in support of  Burt's (1992) view, we found that losses of struc  tural hole bridges were damaging to organizational  performance, especially under conditions of low  turnover. It would be beneficial for future research  to explore the conditions under which social capi  tal losses in dense network structures are damaging  to organizational performance. These investiga  tions may possibly uncover a substantive reason  why network density was a strong "main effect"  predictor of performance, but did not buffer the  negative relationship between social capital losses  and performance. It is possible that the nature of  our context?a service-based one where bridging  communication links are of the utmost impor  tance?increased their importance and diminished  the importance of density as a buffer.  This research should also be evaluated in light of  its limitations. We focused on a single context,  facilities in a restaurant chain, and while this focus  offers advantages in terms of eliminating certain  confounds (e.g., identical organizational structures,  similar facility sizes, common performance met  rics) and eliminates cross-industry confounds, it  places limits on the generalizability of the findings.  Our analysis sample size was only 38 stores, and  while the significant findings may speak to the  robustness of the effects, these results should be  viewed as only preliminary support for our new  theoretical direction. Although our response rates  were quite high across the analysis sample (more  than 65 and 80 percent overall in our analysis sam  ple), network research is very sensitive to missing  responses. It is not possible to estimate whether the  variation in response across stores would over- or  underestimate the true effect sizes for these rela  tionships. We also examined the overall turnover  rate?that is, we did not distinguish among various  sources of turnover (quits, discharges, transfers,  etc.). There is considerable evidence that the etiol  ogies of quits and discharges differ (Shaw et al.,  1998), and the consequences may also be divergent.  Our performance measures were limited to varia  tions in store sales and common productivity met  rics, and although we would argue that these are  appropriate in this context, additional operation  alizations would have been useful and interesting.  We were unable to obtain additional descriptive  information on the stores, such as costs, square feet,  and so forth, that would also have added richness  to our analyses. In terms of social capital theory,  the source of turnover should not matter because  key communication linkages can disappear in vol  untary quit, involuntary discharge, and transfer sit  uations alike. In terms of human capital theory, it is  sometimes argued that workforce performance will  increase if poor performers are discharged, but the  existing empirical evidence does not support this  contention (e.g., McElroy, Morrow, & Rude, 2001).  Ameliorating the concern further, we explained  variance in in-role performance losses over and  above that attributable to overall turnover. In-role  performance losses did not have strong predictive  power in this study, perhaps because of restriction This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:03:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2005 Shaw, Duffy, Johnson, and Lockhart 605  of range in the aggregated measure. Finally, in  our theoretical approach and tests we assumed a  certain causal sequence, although it is possible  that performance differences have a causal influ  ence on future turnover levels. Although the ex  isting empirical evidence lends more support to  the causal sequence examined here, we encour  age future researchers to attempt to disentangle  this issue. In particular, we encourage research  that examines these issues over time. For exam  ple, the causative effects of turnover on perfor  mance may be most pronounced in the short term  (e.g., in the time frame studied here), as organi  zations attempt to recover from social and human  capital losses. The causative effects of perfor  mance on turnover rates may be more pro  nounced over a longer time window, as the  effects of poorer company reputation, organiza  tional climate, and the like begin to have an im  pact. We also encourage additional studies that  include local area data on unemployment rates  and business conditions that may have influ  enced the current results. Readers should inter  pret our results with these cautionary notes in  mind.  To conclude, we developed and tested a social  capital theory of the relationship between turnover  rates and the performance of organizations. The  results contribute to the growing speculation that  the value in intraorganizational relationships and,  in our case, the loss of value contained in commu  nication networks can explain significant and prac  tical amounts of variation in organizational perfor  mance. These results also show the effects of social  capital loss through turnover to be more pronounced  when overall turnover is low. We encourage future  researchers to use this study as a point of departure  for more comprehensive theories of workforce stabil  ity, social capital, and organizational performance.
