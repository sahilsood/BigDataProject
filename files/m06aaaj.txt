Design/methodology/approach – This study in this paper uses regression analysis to examine annual report disclosure of environmental information after a major accident in the mining industry. A multiple-item disclosure score is tailored to the Canadian accounting environment, and used as a dependent variable. Findings – This paper ﬁnds that companies that maintain themselves in the public eye through press release activity disclose more information than other companies. However there is no evidence to suggest that disclosure content is moderated by ﬁnancial performance. Companies that obtained external ﬁnancing one year after the accident made more disclosure than other companies. The signiﬁcance of the external ﬁnancing variable is evident when disclosure is restricted to discretionary or non-ﬁnancial items, but disappears if the dependent variable represents mandatory ﬁnancial items. Research limitations/implications – The paper shoes that while Ullmann addressed the matter of actual social responsibility performance, in addition to disclosure, this paper does not examine performance. Furthermore, press release activity is only one type of strategic posture. Future work that employs some other measure may yield additional insight into the decision-making process. Originality/value – Prior study of Ullmann’s work has not considered the interactive impact of proﬁt and strategic posture. Furthermore, the actual nature of the disclosure, voluntary versus mandatory, has not been speciﬁcally examined. This paper addresses both of these issues. Keywords Social responsibility, Accounting, Mining industry, Financial performance, Disclosure, Canada Paper type Research paper Introduction Although the users of accounting information were initially considered to be the ﬁnancial stakeholders, companies now use their annual reports to provide a variety of information on non-ﬁnancial issues such as relations with employees, customers and the outside community, as well as information on environmental impacts (Owen, 1990). Proponents of legitimacy theory have suggested several ways that companies use discussion of non-ﬁnancial issues to manage stakeholder impressions. For example, they can use environmental disclosures to try to inﬂuence stakeholder reaction to The author wishes to thank Professor Deirdre Taylor CGA (Ryerson School of Business Management) for her assistance with data collection, and Ryerson’s Faculty of Business for providing ﬁnancial support for this research.

There is also evidence that managers use non-ﬁnancial and ﬁnancial disclosures in different ways as part of an impressions management strategy (Walden and Schwartz, 1997). However, environmental disclosure policy remains difﬁcult to deﬁne, in part because disclosed information is often unrelated to a company’s actual performance, and because analyses of the relationships between environmental and ﬁnancial performance on the one hand, and between environmental disclosure and ﬁnancial performance on the other, have revealed numerous inconsistencies. Ullmann (1985) said that corporate social responsibility is an under-theorized area of academic enquiry. Furthermore, he suggested that prior studies have omitted a key variable from their analyses, which accounts for the inconsistent ﬁndings. This paper applies the Ullmann contingency framework in an attempt to test his ideas, and to lay the groundwork for the resolution of inconsistencies through future research. Ullmann suggested that strategic posture and ﬁnancial performance (proﬁt), considered in light of stakeholder power, provide a basis for the determination of a cohesive, systematic response to external demands for environmental information. In Canada, the following inter-related factors suggest that stakeholder power has been growing for several years: . The growing public concern for the environmental impacts of business activity. . The predominance of institutional traders in the North American market. . The growing interest in ethical investing among institutional investors. Ethical investors apply a social responsibility screen as part of the investment decision-making process. The factors cited above suggest that when institutional investors consider investing in Canada, they apply such a screen because of this country’s resource-based economy. The failure of a tailings dam at the Omai mine in Guyana in 1995 drew attention to the environmental impacts of the mining industry. This mine is partly owned by Cambior, a Canadian public company. Given that many mining companies rely on operations outside their home countries, the potential repercussions of this accident were likely to trigger a response across the industry. If legitimacy theory is correct, this response is likely to be reﬂected (at least partly) through companies’ disclosure of information concerning environmental risk and management, thus providing an opportunity to explore Ullmann’s ideas of the relationship of disclosure with strategic posture and ﬁnancial performance. Conceptual framework Legitimacy theory has its roots in the idea of a social contract between the corporation and society. A company’s survival and growth depend on its ability to deliver desirable ends, to distribute economic, social, or political beneﬁts to the groups from which it derives its power (Shocker and Sethi, 1974). Early accounting theory identiﬁed the users of accounting information as creditors and shareholders – the ﬁnancial stakeholders. Disclosures in annual reports were directed primarily to those groups alone, and designed to discharge stewardship obligations so as to ensure ongoing access to ﬁnancial markets (Gray et al., 1995). Over time, the concept of the stakeholder expanded to include insurers, suppliers, consumer associations, regulators, environmental groups, and the media, plus others (Canadian Institute of Chartered Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 08:01 03 February 2017 (PT)AAAJ 19,4 542 Accountants, 1997). The objective of accounting expanded to include the provision of information to help stakeholders estimate the amount, timing, and uncertainty of future cash ﬂows (Financial Accounting Standards Board, 1978), as well as to satisfy social interests (Gray et al., 1995). This put considerable pressure on company managers to ﬁnd ways to respond to a diversity of interests. Legitimacy theory was subsequently integrated into the accounting literature as a means of explaining what, why, when, and how certain items are addressed by corporate management in their communication with outside audiences. Legitimacy theory begins with the assumption that an organization has no inherent right to exist. This right is conferred upon it by society, but only when the company’s value system is perceived to be congruent with that of the society in which it operates (Dowling and Pfeffer, 1975; Lindblom, 1994). Furthermore, this right can be revoked if the company is thought to have breached any of the terms of its social contract (Deegan, 2002). This revocation could be accomplished by consumers reducing demand for the company’s product or service, by suppliers limiting access to labour or ﬁnancial capital, or by stakeholders lobbying for legislation that would impact the cash ﬂow of the company (Terreberry, 1968). The social contract itself contains both explicit terms, spelled out in the form of legal requirements, and implicit terms, which include the non-legislated societal expectations (Gray et al., 1996). The implicit terms may eventually be enshrined in clearly deﬁned legislation, but until that occurs managers can vary in their interpretation of these terms, and in their response. Since legitimacy theory is based on perception, any response by management must be accompanied by disclosure, for actions which are not publicized will not be effective in changing external parties’ views of the organization (Cormier and Gordon, 2001). While disclosure within the ﬁnancial sections of a company’s annual report are subject to guidelines established by the accounting profession and other regulators, management has considerable ﬂexibility with regard to the discussion (if any) in the other sections. Lindblom (1994) said that in the process of attaining legitimacy, a company could use corporate social responsibility (CSR) discussion to: . correct public misunderstanding of its performance (if a “legitimacy gap” has arisen through public misconception); . alter expectations of performance (if management thinks the public has an . unrealistic expectation of its responsibilities); show how the company has improved performance (if the organization is thought to have failed in one of its perceived roles); and . deﬂect attention away from performance (if the organization has strengths – such as a good record of charitable contributions – that it wishes to emphasize, in order to direct the public’s attention away from other aspects of its performance – such as a pollution problem). While corporations can and do use other media for making social responsibility disclosures (Ze´ghal and Ahmed, 1990), the use of the annual report for legitimation purposes has been observed in a variety of studies (Salancik and Meindl, 1984; Amernic, 1992; Dyball, 1998; O’Donovan, 2002). If legitimacy theory correctly describes the disclosure decision process, then an effective disclosure policy requires management to: Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 08:01 03 February 2017 (PT)An empirical test of legitimacy theory 543 . . keep track of public interest issues (Guthrie and Parker, 1989; O’Donovan, 2002); consider the relative importance of different stakeholder groups (Neu et al., 1998); and tailor social disclosures accordingly (Patten, 1992). . A substantial body of evidence supports the allegation that there is a strategic element to the disclosure process. Deegan and Gordon (1996) found higher levels of environmental disclosure when membership in environmental groups is rising. Environmental disclosures increase when environmental problems and penalties are the focus of media attention (Neu et al., 1998; Deegan et al., 2000). This latter research also found that other types of social reporting increased along with environmental disclosure, suggesting that companies use social responsibility discussion to frame outside users’ overall view of company performance. In addition to ﬁnding a link between level of disclosure and public interest, Neu et al. (1998) and Freedman and Jaggi (1988) found that disclosure rises when net income declines, suggesting that management uses social reporting to deﬂect attention from poor ﬁnancial performance. There is also evidence that environmental disclosure provides organizations with methods of managing potentially discrediting events such as environmental ﬁnes (Warsame et al., 2002). Furthermore, disclosure decisions were found to differ, depending on whether the objective is to gain, maintain, or repair legitimacy (O’Donovan, 2002). Changes in legislation are often triggered by accidents, and these changes can affect entire industries and extend to other countries. For example, after a train derailment outside Toronto in 1979 forced the evacuation of 250,000 people, British Rail launched new directives banning trains from carrying toxic chemicals and ﬂammables together (Globe and Mail, 1979). Trotman (1979) suggested that companies could use social disclosure to reduce the chances of a legislative backlash by convincing the public that they are acting in a socially responsible manner. Empirical evidence to support this view comes from the chemical and textile industries. Chemical company shares declined in price after the Union Carbide accident in Bhopal (Blacconiere and Patten, 1994), and again when superfund regulation was amended to expand the reporting requirements for ﬁrms that release hazardous materials into the environment (Blacconiere and Northcut, 1997). In the textile industry, share prices declined after Occupational Safety and Health standards were tightened (Freedman and Stagliano, 1991). In all three of these studies, share response was modiﬁed by the extent or nature of prior disclosure. These ﬁndings suggest the following: (1) Shareholders are alert to public perceptions of a company’s social impacts. (2) A stakeholder backlash can trigger new regulation with prospective cash ﬂow repercussions. (3) Management can in some cases moderate this backlash through the disclosure process. Walden and Schwartz (1997) suggested that managers use non-ﬁnancial disclosure in response to demands for CSR discussion, and tend to withhold ﬁnancial information unless regulation calls for its release. Public interest is faster to change than regulation; therefore ﬁnancial disclosure is expected to be more constant over time. Analyses of increase in environmental discussion (both annual reports showed a substantial ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial) in in 1989 (the year of the Exxon Valdez accident) Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 08:01 03 February 2017 (PT)AAAJ 19,4 544 comparison to earlier years. This increase was observed in the oil industry (Patten, 1992), and by companies in the chemical, forest, and consumer products sectors as well (Walden and Schwartz, 1997). Walden and Schwartz also found that non-ﬁnancial environmental disclosure declined in 1990. While the extent of environmental disclosure appears to respond to stakeholder concern, efforts to deﬁne a systematic corporate environmental disclosure policy have been fraught with difﬁculty. This difﬁculty stems from problems with three potential correlations: (1) between environmental disclosure and environmental performance; (2) between environmental performance and ﬁnancial performance; and (3) between environmental disclosure and ﬁnancial performance. Much of the prior literature ﬁnds little agreement between companies’ environmental performance and their discussion (if any) of that performance. If disclosures are supposed to provide accurate information about actual performance, then disclosure often fails. In the annual reports of US companies, environmental disclosures are vague, incomplete, or unreliable (Wiseman, 1982; Rockness, 1985; Freedman and Wasley, 1990; Gamble et al., 1995). Similar conclusions were drawn in the UK (Harte and Owen, 1991), across Europe and in Japan (Fekrat et al., 1996), in Australia (Deegan and Gordon, 1996), and in Canada (Blunn, 1992). These ﬁndings argue that stakeholders are not provided with the information they need to estimate the amount, timing, or uncertainty of future cash ﬂows, nor do they receive the information required to evaluate management’s satisfaction of its stewardship responsibilities with regard to environmental resources. One might conclude that companies use disclosure to deliberately mislead their stakeholders. On the other hand, if the key objective of environmental disclosure is to manage stakeholder expectations, one should not necessarily expect a correlation with performance at all (Neu et al., 1998). Assessments of the last two correlations – between environmental performance and ﬁnancial performance, and between environmental disclosure and ﬁnancial performance – are inconsistent. For example, Freedman and Jaggi (1992) found no long-term association of pollution performance with ﬁnancial performance in the pulp and paper industry. On the other hand, a reduction in emissions was negatively associated with productivity in the brewing industry (Smith and Sims, 1985), and in the electrical utilities industry (Gollop and Roberts, 1983). However, Russo and Fouts (1997) found a positive association of environmental and ﬁnancial performance across a variety of industries. With regard to environmental disclosure and proﬁtability, Freedman and Jaggi (1988) and Neu et al. (1998) found that large companies with poor ﬁnancial performance make more disclosure. On the other hand, large companies, and those with good ﬁnancial performance, were observed to make more disclosure in Cormier and Magnan (1999). These inconsistent ﬁndings, coupled with the uncertainty as to management’s objective, have cast doubt on the legitimacy of environmental disclosure as an area of accounting research enquiry (Gray et al., 1995). Research over the past 15 years has identiﬁed additional variables associated with the extent and/or nature of disclosure, such as: . Company size (Lang and Lundholm, 1993; Neu et al., 1998; Bewley and Li, 2000). . The privacy of management information (Bewley and Li, 2000). Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 08:01 03 February 2017 (PT). Enforcement efforts by regulatory bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (Barth et al., 1997; Neu et al., 1998). . Dependence on capital markets (Gibbins et al., 1990; Lang and Lundholm, 1993; Botosan, 1997; Barth et al., 1997; Sengupta, 1998; Cormier and Magnan, 1999). Industry (Gray et al., 2001) and related factors such as industry growth rate and degree of concentration (Russo and Fouts, 1997). . An empirical test of legitimacy theory 545 Some of these studies looked speciﬁcally at environmental disclosures, but none addressed the problem of the inconsistent correlations discussed above. Ullmann suggested that such conﬂicting ﬁndings are the result of empiricists working without an underlying theory that captures the strategic considerations that motivate the decision-making process. He suggested that strategic posture articulates with two other factors – ﬁnancial performance, and stakeholder power – to explain disclosure, and that the omission of strategic posture from these earlier studies may explain their contradictory results (Ullmann, 1985). This was a descriptive piece of literature however, and no empirical evidence was offered in its support. Strategic posture refers to the way an organization’s decision makers respond to external demands. An active posture involves deliberate efforts to manage the impressions of important stakeholders. With a passive posture, no attempt is made to monitor stakeholder concerns, or to deﬁne an optimal stakeholder management strategy. Both active and passive postures are moderated by ﬁnancial performance, as the ability and desire to attend to social demands are at least partially tied to ﬁnancial success. This is because the cost of obtaining certain information, such as the cost of environmental remediation, may dissuade ﬁnancially unsuccessful companies from disclosing this sort of information (Lang and Lundholm, 1993; Neu et al., 1998). Furthermore, the litigation costs of non-disclosure could be higher for successful companies than for unsuccessful ones (Skinner, 1994). The third item to consider in this framework is stakeholder power. High stakeholder power means stakeholders control resources critical to the company. The growth of socially responsible investing (SRI), considered in light of institutional market power, suggests that stakeholder power plays a vital role in driving management decisions in the mining industry in Canada. Clusters of socially conscious investors operated at the grassroots level in the 1960s (Papmehl, 2001). In the 1980s, SRI gained the attention of the professional money managers with the establishment of the ﬁrst ethical fund in the UK, and within four years there were 14 such funds, with assets totalling £144 million and a growth rate of about 50 percent (Ethical Investment Research Service (EIRIS), 1989). In the UK, the Trades Union Congress actively encouraged pension fund trustees to consider the social ramiﬁcations of their investments, and this concern spread to several trade unions in the US (Owen, 1990). The SRI movement has inﬂuenced legislation in the UK, where pension fund trustees are required to disclose their SRI policies if they have them (Papmehl, 2001). Independent organizations such as the Council on Economic Priorities in the USA, the UK Ethical Investment Research Service, and Ethicscan and Jantzi Research Associates Inc. in Canada offer independent research services to social investors. The size of the institutional traders relative to the capital market highlights the power of these stakeholders. In Canada, institutional investments now total over Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 08:01 03 February 2017 (PT)AAAJ 19,4 546 $1.5 trillion (SIO Forum, 2000) (December). This compares to a total investment market in Canada of $2.0 trillion in November 2002 (TSX, 2002). In Canada, even funds that are not speciﬁcally identiﬁed as social investments are targeted with calls for ethical screening. For example, the Ontario Teachers Federation has called for social screening of one of the largest pension funds in the country, and John McNaughton, CEO of the investment arm of the Canada Pension Plan, has said there are concerns about the ethical issues involved in some of their investment decisions (SIO Forum, 2000) (September). Based on the dominance of the institutional players in the capital market, and their inclusion of CSR matters in their investment decision framework, it will be assumed for the purpose of this analysis that stakeholder power has been high in Canada for several years, and that social responsibility is one of the stakeholders’ guiding investment principles. Ullmann argued that in periods of high stakeholder power, companies with an active strategic posture make deliberate and conscious efforts to satisfy stakeholder demands through both actual performance and disclosure of information about that performance. The predominance of the mining industry in Canada means the Canadian capital market provides an opportunity to subject his hypothesized contingency framework to empirical testing. A modiﬁed version of Ullmann’s framework is illustrated in Table I. The current paper excludes consideration of actual environmental performance, so all reference to social performance is excluded from the table. In Ullmann’s contingency framework, situation 1 indicates positive correlations between: . . strategic posture and ﬁnancial performance; strategic posture and disclosure; and . ﬁnancial performance and disclosure. For example, when management employs an active strategic posture, and ﬁnancial performance is good, a high level of environmental disclosure is expected if stakeholder power is high. In this situation, management tries to advertise its success across the entire performance spectrum (Ullmann, 1985). This means going beyond the disclosure speciﬁed by professional or regulatory authorities to include extensive discussion of CSR.

Ullmann’s contingency framework Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 08:01 03 February 2017 (PT)An empirical test of legitimacy theory 547 a negative premium on social disclosure (such as dollars spent on environmental protection) is minimal. When stakeholder power is low, however, as in situation 5, this same company reduces CSR discussion as there is less compelling demand for it. In situation 2, the company is expected to exhibit high levels of mandatory disclosure. The unfavorable economic situation leads to a rationalization strategy of using required disclosures to report the burdensome ﬁnancial impact of social regulation. Voluntary disclosure, however, is low for fear that investors will react negatively to excessive social expenditures. In situations 3 and 4, a passive approach toward stakeholder impressions management means the company does not attempt to exploit the strategic potential of disclosure. Managers who use a passive approach are unlikely to monitor stakeholder power or adapt their disclosures in light of that power. Ullmann suggests that in this situation the levels of mandatory disclosure are indeterminate, while voluntary disclosures are expected to be low (situations 5 through 8, where stakeholder power is low, are not relevant to this study.) Roberts (1992) presented empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that high stakeholder power, an active strategic posture, and good ﬁnancial performance contribute to good social disclosure. Roberts made no effort, however, to distinguish mandatory from discretionary disclosure, nor did he explore potential interactions among variables. Both are important, given Ullmann’s belief that management will exploit the greater ﬂexibility of voluntary disclosure as a method of shaping stakeholder impressions when ﬁnancial performance is good. Furthermore, the Roberts paper operationalized stakeholder power using independent variables that are to some extent controlled by management. For example, he used the debt-equity ratio, and the proportion of shares owned by management, as alternative proxies for stakeholder power. Both, however, are subject to company control. This means the analysis showed management response (disclosure) to situations contrived by management itself. The current analysis both distinguishes between the use of discretionary and mandatory disclosure, and focuses on a situation where stakeholder power is beyond company inﬂuence, while investigating managers’ use of communication to shape stakeholder impressions. In summary, legitimacy theory argues that managers use disclosure to shape stakeholder impression of the role and responsibility of the corporation, and the degree to which the company is satisfying those responsibilities. Ullmann has said that strategic posture needs to be considered along with ﬁnancial performance and stakeholder power. Prior efforts to subject his ideas to empirical examination have not considered the interactive impact of proﬁtability and strategic posture; furthermore, the measure of stakeholder power used in earlier work was subject to company control, and the content of disclosure – voluntary versus mandatory – was not speciﬁcally examined. The current analysis is structured to address all of these concerns. Hypothesis, model and data collection The context for this study is 1995, following the failure of a tailings dam at the Omai gold mine in Guyana in August of that year. Three million cubic meters of wastewater contaminated with cyanide and copper sludge ﬂooded the countryside and the river system. A state of environmental emergency was declared. Environmentalists and scientists compared it to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in terms of potential long-term environmental and health repercussions (Chatterjee, 1995). The Exxon Valdez accident Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 08:01 03 February 2017 (PT)AAAJ 19,4 548 elevated environmental concerns in the public eye, threatening congressional approval for the development of Florida’s offshore areas and the Alaska Arctic National Refuge, in effect turning one company’s accident into an industry-wide problem (Toronto Star, 1989). In the Canadian mining industry, where offshore operations are common, a mining accident in another country can have a similar impact. A year after the dam failure in Guyana, the President and CEO of Placer Dome – a Canadian mining company – commented on how the Omai mine accident had sensitized emerging countries to the environmental effects of the mining industry (Reuters, 1996). When the accident occurred, the mine was closed for ﬁve months, and Cambior – another Canadian gold mining company and one of the owners of the Omai mine – incurred US$2.2 million in direct costs, plus capital expenditures of $6.8 million to return the mine to operation: furthermore, the company lost US$2.5 million for each month the mine was closed (Northern Miner, 1995). A Guyanese Commission of Enquiry recommended the establishment of environmental protection regulation for the country’s industries (Northern Miner, 1996). A lobby group – Recherches Internationales Quebec – ﬁled a class action lawsuit against Cambior, and lobbied ﬁnancial institutions in both Canada and the USA to discourage them from providing capital to the owners. The Canadian mining industry formed a task force to design a new policy on tailings pond construction (The Mining Association of Canada, 1998). It can therefore be concluded that this accident not only affected gold mining operations in Guyana, but it raised both management and stakeholder concern for the industry as a whole. While institutional investors’ interests generally include a variety of social matters, an accident such as this one would focus them, at least temporarily, on environmental issues. Furthermore, Mitchell et al. (1997) argued that urgency is a critical factor necessary for an issue to warrant management attention. Since one of the tenets of legitimacy theory is that companies use disclosure to convey information as to how they are dealing with matters of interest to stakeholders, this accident provides the setting for an examination of the relationship between strategic posture and environmental disclosure. The hypothesis to be tested is this: When there is a demand for information on environmental risk and management, managers’ response – measured by items of disclosure in the annual report – depends upon the companies’ strategic posture. In other words, the nature of environmental disclosure is modiﬁed by a company’s strategic posture. A sample of gold mining companies was selected for this study, subject to two criteria: (1) The company was a publicly traded Canadian company at the time of the accident. (2) The company was identiﬁed with a primary Compustat SIC of 1,040 (gold and silver ores). Using these criteria, 44 companies were identiﬁed. The model used to explore the relationship is: Scorei ¼ B0i þ BliPRi þ B2iSizei þ B3iXFini þ B4iROAi þ 1i ð1Þ Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 08:01 03 February 2017 (PT)where: Scorei PRi is a multiple item disclosure variable discussed in Table II and below; is the number of press releases from company i over the 12-month period ending December 31, 1995, the year of the accident; An empirical test of legitimacy theory Sizei is the natural log of the market value of company i, adjusted as discussed in the discussion of control variables below 549 XFini is a dummy variable equal to 1 if company i obtained external ﬁnancing in the ﬁscal year following the year of the accident; ROAi is the return on assets of company i in 1995; B0i 1i is the intercept; and is the error term.

While CSR disclosure is not limited to the annual report (Ze´ghal and Ahmed, 1990), this medium is a primary information source for institutional investors (Epstein and Freedman, 1996) and environmental groups (Patten, 1992; Gamble et al., 1995). Furthermore, despite limits to the accuracy of its contents, as noted earlier, CSR discussion is considered to have greater credibility when it is included in the annual report than in other media (Tilt, 1994), possibly because of its proximity to the audited ﬁnancial statements (Warsame et al., 2002). Finally, Rankin (1996) observed that most stakeholders seeking environmental information look ﬁrst to the annual report. While the emergence of the standalone environmental report in the 1990s has led to questions about the relative importance of the annual report as a disclosure medium, the Gibson and O’Donovan (2000) found that annual report disclosure of environmental information was still on an upward trend in the latter part of the decade. This ﬁnding suggests that management continued to regard the annual report as a key medium for disclosure of this nature. Several earlier papers used volume of disclosure as the dependent variable (Cowen et al., 1987; Guthrie and Parker, 1989; Patten, 1991; Neu et al., 1998), instead of a scoring system such as the one used here. These earlier studies tried to identify factors driving the decision to disclose information about a host of social issues such as human resource or environmental matters, or company involvement with the community. While volume of discussion may reﬂect the emphasis management places on a particular topic, in impressions fails to capture the subtle issues inherent it Score (range 0-7) Number of companies 0 8 1 4 2 4 3 13 4 10 5 3 6 1 7 1 Table II.

Roberts (1992) used a disclosure scoring system derived from the US Council on Economic Priorities (CEP) ratings. As was the case with the other volume of disclosure measures, this rating system: excellent (2), good (1), or poor (0), failed to distinguish mandatory from discretionary disclosure. In their analyses of the value relevance of environmental disclosure, Blacconiere and Patten (1994) and Blacconiere and Northcut (1997) used a multiple item-scoring factor that addressed speciﬁc types of disclosure content. In these two studies disclosure was an independent variable. Again, however, the disclosure factor was used to represent quantity only. The present study uses a similar method to assess disclosure, but attempts also to capture the distinct nature of disclosure items. This score factor is used initially to represent breadth of disclosure, and later modiﬁed so as to distinguish the different types of information content. Environmental disclosures were measured for each of the 44 companies using a seven- point-scoring factor – Scorei – detailed in Table II. Each annual report, was scored independently, by two accounting-professors. Disagreements were resolved through discussion once the reviews were complete. A score of 0 or 1 was assigned for each of the items shown below, regardless of where it was included in the report: . A – statements on the compliance status or compliance efforts of the company relative to environmental standards. . B – existence of a board or executive level committee responsible for monitoring environmental regulations and the environmental impact of operations. . C – presentation of current year cash ﬂows for environmental control or remediation. . D – disclosure of next year’s estimated cash ﬂows for environmental control/remediation. . E – disclosure of current period estimate of future environmental liability. . F – disclosure of estimated total future environmental liability. . G – statements on current/potential environmental actions/lawsuits against the company. Items A, C, D, and G were included in the score factor used by Blacconiere and Patten (1994). Item B is included as a signal of management commitment to environmental stewardship[1]. Disclosure items E and F were recommended in s3060 (Capital Assets) of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants handbook for the year in question (the handbook has been modiﬁed since that time.) This part of the handbook was speciﬁcally designed to provide guidance to companies in the natural resource industry. Item F referred to the estimated liability associated with land reclamation activities that would be scheduled for the end of each mine’s useful life. The aggregated estimate, totalled across all of the company’s sites, corresponds to item F in this disclosure score. It was industry practice to accrue a portion of this liability annually using a units-of-production method. The annual accrual corresponds to item E. These two items will be classiﬁed as mandatory ﬁnancial disclosures for the purpose of the extended analysis to follow. Li and McConomy (1999) present evidence that item F is value relevant in the Canadian capital market. It should be noted, however, that Canadian accounting guidelines grant considerable discretion as to how and what is Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 08:01 03 February 2017 (PT)disclosed. Despite its handbook status, item F was often omitted from annual reports, and item G, disclosure of current or potential litigation, while also required in s3290 (Contingencies), is also often omitted (Li et al., 1997). Scorei, ranging from 0 to 7, is designed to include a variety of information categories such as monetary items (items C through F), as well as qualitative items such as A, B and G. Items D and F are future-oriented ﬁnancial items, while C and E pertain to the year just ended. The distribution of scores across the 44 companies, and of the scoring for each individual item are shown in Table II. Eight companies had a score of nil. Only one company was disclosed in each of the seven possible categories. The average score was 2.7 (Table III). An empirical test of legitimacy theory 551 Key independent variable: strategic posture Managers have the opportunity to devise a company speciﬁc strategy to shape stakeholder impressions. For example, they may choose from a variety of media according to their communication objectives (Ze´ghal and Ahmed, 1990). Alternatively they can utilize a company sponsored philanthropic foundation, or invest heavily in their own public affairs ofﬁces (Roberts, 1992). Both approaches, however – investment in a foundation, or in a public relations ofﬁce – are largely dependent on company size. As a relatively low cost method of investing in stakeholder management strategy, press release activity is a more readily available alternative, and is the method chosen for this study. Press releases are not necessarily the most efﬁcient medium for communication, for they do not focus on a particular target market as effectively as other media such as brochures or advertising (Ze´ghal and Ahmed, 1990). However, when this accident occurred, the situation could not be described as normal. In a situation of high stakeholder power, an accident such as this one calls for an immediate response that Variable Mean St. dev Minimum Maximum Scorei MV i PRi Xfini ROAi Correlation matrix Scorei Sizei PRi XFini ROAi 2.66 1,054 47.444 0.488 3.821 1.000 0.437 0.332 0.320 – 0.174 Scorei 1.83 2,340 69.480 0.506 20.737 1.000 – 0.002 0.010 – 0.137 Sizei 0 2 0 0 7.000 12,430 294 1 – 19.080 118.64 1.000 0.090 – 0.069 PRi 1.000 0.097 XFini 1.000 ROAi Notes: Description of variables: Scorei – is a seven-point disclosure rating (Table VII); MV i – is the market value of the company in millions of Canadian dollars on August 18, 1995, one day before the accident; PRi – is the number of press releases by company i in the calendar year 1995, the year of the Omai mine accident; XFini – is a dummy variable equal to 1 if company i obtained new external ﬁnancing in the ﬁscal year following the year of the accident; and ROAi – is the return on assets of company i the year the accident occurred. Sizei is MV i (see above) transformed into the natural log of the market value, regressed against the inter-listing and geographic variables, and PRi as described in the discussion of control variables.

Furthermore in a situation such as this, communication that results in a press release could originate with the press itself. This is more likely to occur, however, if a communication link between the company and the press has already been established. This suggests that companies that use press releases on a regular basis are likely to issue more communications after the accident than companies that do not normally access the press. Given the use of the annual report as the source of the disclosure variable, a press release period covering the 12 months leading up to the end of the year in which the accident occurred is chosen, for disclosure decisions are made at year-end. All but three of the 41 companies used in the analysis had ﬁscal (reporting) year-ends of December 31. Most of the company managers would therefore be devising their disclosure strategies shortly after that date (regression results using press releases counted over a period of time that precedes the date of the accident are discussed later in this paper.) Press release activity was measured using Factiva, a database providing access to several media sources, including over 270 presswires. All press releases were examined to ensure that only those with information directly from the company were included. For example: . Company X announces a new addition to its board of directors. . Company X announces its quarterly results. Would each be counted as a press release from Company X? On the other hand, an announcement from Company Y that it has just purchased shares in Company X would not. The number of press releases per company over this time period varied from 0 to 294, with a mean of about 47 (Table III). Press release activity is used in this analysis as a proxy for media presence. Some companies choose to operate in the public eye, while others operate quietly away from public view. Frequent media presence means the company is often brought into stakeholder view. If Ullmann is correct, then given the strength of stakeholder power in Canada in the mid-1990s, a company with an active strategic posture (strong media presence) will be a high discloser. For this reason, the press release coefﬁcient (B1i) in equation 1 is expected to be statistically signiﬁcant and positive. The control variables: external funding, size, and ﬁnancial performance The XFini variable is included to indicate whether or not company i accessed the external market for new ﬁnancing in the ﬁscal year following the year of the accident (of the companies examined in this study 20 increased their reliance on external capital, largely through the expansion of long-term bank debt.) Companies use disclosure to provide information on ﬁnancial position and operating risk. This is particularly important for companies that access ﬁnancial markets on a regular basis (Gibbins et al., 1990; Lang and Lundholm, 1993; Frankel et al., 1995). Blacconiere and Patten (1994) suggested that discretionary disclosures reduce investor uncertainties when the company is dealing with operations perceived as high risk. The industry-wide repercussions of the Omai mine accident likely made investors wary of the environmental risk factor. A substantial portion of the Scorei factor (items A through D) is discretionary, therefore, the coefﬁcient for the XFini variable is expected to be positive. The association of size with environmental disclosure is well established in the accounting literature (Patten, 1992; Neu et al., 1998; Bewley and Li, 2000). In keeping with Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 08:01 03 February 2017 (PT)An empirical test of legitimacy theory 553 these earlier ﬁndings, the size coefﬁcient is expected to be positive. Several other control factors were considered, but were subsequently discarded. For example, preliminary analyses showed that disclosure is not associated with a company’s listing status (1 if the company was inter-listed on a major US exchange; 0 otherwise). Nor was disclosure associated with the major geographic location of company operations: none of the categorical variables used to distinguish companies with major operations in Central or South America from those focused on Africa or Asia, or from those with operations restricted to North America, were statistically signiﬁcant. As might be expected, however, the geographic and listing variables were all signiﬁcantly associated with size. Company size, based on market value, was subsequently regressed against these other variables, and the residuals from that regression were used in equation 1. Financial performance is measured as return on assets (ROA). Using the broadly deﬁned disclosure variable in the early part of this analysis, ﬁnancial performance is included as a control variable with an indeterminate sign. The role of ﬁnancial performance will be explored in greater detail shortly. Results and discussion The results of equation 1 (Tables IV and V) can be summarized as follows: . . . environmental disclosure increases with company size; companies with plans to access external ﬁnancial markets disclose more information on environmental issues; and companies that pursue an active strategy of stakeholder management through press releases make more extensive environmental disclosures, even when size is taken into consideration. In other words, with the exception of ﬁnancial performance (ROA), all signs on coefﬁcients conformed to expectation, and all coefﬁcients were statistically signiﬁcant. The explanatory power of the model exceeds that obtained in some of the prior analyses that used volume of words as the disclosure factor (Patten, 1991; Neu et al., 1998).

The runs test results support the assumption that the residuals were randomly distributed; however, the Jarque-Bera and chi-square test results both suggested a non-normal distribution. For this reason, further investigation into the existence of a relationship between Scorei and PRi was conducted using a Spearman’s Rank test as described below: . Key variable PRi was regressed against factors (Sizei;XFini and ROAi) to obtain residuals labelled PRi-adjusted. The absolute values of these residuals were ranked in ascending value, along with Scorei:Scorei is a whole number ranging from 0 (rank 1) to 7 (rank 8), while PRi-adjusted consisted of rational numbers. This meant there were eight distinct ranks for Scorei, but 41 distinct ranks for PRi-adjusted. the other independent . Observations were grouped according to the rank of Scorei. The mean and median value for the corresponding PRi-adjusted values were calculated, and ranked. For example, eight companies had a score of 0, (rank 1). The corresponding PRi-adjusted group mean (14.9) was the second lowest group mean, so it was assigned rank 2. Four companies had a score of 1 (rank 2) and the PRi-adjusted group mean (23.8) was the ﬁfth largest group mean, so it was assigned Rank 5. Four companies had a score of 2 (rank 3) and the corresponding PRi-adjusted group mean was assigned rank 4. . The data included one outlier. This company was Pegasus Gold Inc., the only company to score a full disclosure score of 7. However, this company’s press release volume (adjusted, as described above) was only 46. (The unadjusted press release volume for this company was 63, well below the maximum of 294.) This company was dropped from the analysis, and the Spearman’s Rank test was applied to the remaining seven groups. The resulting t-value supports the conclusion that there is a systematic relationship between Scorei and PRi-adjusted, at a ¼ 0:10. (Results using the PRi-adjusted median in place of the mean were identical.) If press release activity is a suitable proxy for strategic posture, the results so far support Ullmann’s contention that an active strategic posture is linked to greater CSR disclosure when stakeholder power is high. The lack of explanatory power for ﬁnancial Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 08:01 03 February 2017 (PT)performance in Table IV is not surprising, given the deﬁnition of disclosure. According to the Ullmann (1985) contingency framework, there is a differential impact of ﬁnancial performance on mandatory disclosures on the one hand, and on voluntary disclosures on the other (see Table I). In equation 1, however, the disclosure factor was a combination of both. The relationship of mandatory versus discretionary disclosure with both strategic posture and ﬁnancial performance is considered in the following discussion. This portion of the discussion examines OLS results only (see Table VI). An empirical test of legitimacy theory 555 Separation of score into mandatory and voluntary components Tables VI and VII show the regression results using reduced score variables, with MDisci representing mandatory ﬁnancial including discretionary or non-ﬁnancial items (A, B, C, D, and G) respectively. When disclosure is restricted to mandatory ﬁnancial items the external ﬁnancing variable is no longer statistically signiﬁcant (Table V). On the other hand, when disclosure is restricted to discretionary or non-ﬁnancial items, the external ﬁnancing factor is signiﬁcant at a ¼ 0:01 (Table VII). In other words, when companies contemplate accessing the external market for new ﬁnancing they expand the discretionary environmental disclosures in advance, but not the mandatory ones. This makes intuitive sense, since items (E and F), and DDisci Expected sign Coefﬁcient t-value þ / – þ þ þ þ / – 3.940 * * * 1.950 * 2.190 * * 2.690 * * * – 1.270 1.100 0.005 0.317 0.987 – 0.010 Intercept PRi Sizei XFini ROAi B0i B1i B2i B4i B5i Notes: Signiﬁcant at: a ¼ 0:01* * * ; a ¼ 0:05* * ; a ¼ 0:10* ; R 2 ¼ 0:28.

Regression analysis with interactive term. Dependent variable: discretionary/ non-ﬁnancial disclosures (n ¼ 41) one would expect the annual report to contain the mandatory items regardless of ﬁnancing plans. Also it provides support for the Walden and Schwartz conjecture that companies will use non-ﬁnancial disclosure (which dominates the dependent variable used in equation 3 of Table VII) to inﬂuence external opinion of its CSR performance (Walden and Schwartz, 1997). Finally, building on a suggestion by Gray et al. (1996) that the implicit terms of the social contract embody societal expectations, greater use of discretionary items is expected when management wants to shape external opinion. The explanatory power (R 2) in each of Tables IV-VI varies directly with the breadth of the disclosure (dependent) variable. For example, Table IV shows regression results using the full 7-point score, and R 2 is 0.33. When disclosure is a ﬁve-point item score as in Table VI, the R 2 drops to 0.28. When the disclosure variable takes the narrowest deﬁnition of disclosure by including only items E and F, R 2 falls to 0.24. This suggests that the two components of the score factor – DDisci and Mdisci – are deﬁned so as to measure different types of information. Introduction of interactive term: strategic posture modiﬁed by ﬁnancial performance In equation 4 (Table VIII) the variable RM i is created to distinguish companies with good ﬁnancial performance from those with poor (see Table VII for analysis of RM i). The summary statistics (Table III) show ROA ranging from 2 19.1 to 118.6 percent with a mean of 3.8 percent. RM i is a dummy variable with a value of 1 for those companies with ROA in excess of the mean, signifying good performance; 0 otherwise (alternative deﬁnitions of RM i are discussed in the Sensitivity Analysis section later in this paper.) Equation 4 is designed to highlight the interactive impact of ﬁnancial performance on strategic posture. In a situation of high stakeholder power, companies with good ﬁnancial performance (RM i ¼ 1) and an active posture (high PRi) are expected to be high disclosers of discretionary items (see Table VII). Companies with an active posture and poor ﬁnancial performance (RM i ¼ 0) are expected to be low disclosers of discretionary items. The sign for the coefﬁcient of the interactive term is therefore expected to be positive. Table VIII includes the results of analysis using the interactive RM i term. The strategic posture, size, and external ﬁnancing variables remain statistically signiﬁcant at a ¼ 0:05. The interactive term PRi* RM i is not signiﬁcant, nor is the ﬁnancial performance variable. The coefﬁcient of the interactive term is negative, contrary to expectation.

Sensitivity analysis (i) Alternative measures of ﬁnancial performance Table VIII shows the analysis using the interactive term PRi* RM i, where RM i is 1 if the company’s return on assets exceeds the mean ROA of 3.8 percent. The median ROA for the sample of companies was only 1.63 percent, suggesting that the mean was affected by one or more extreme values. For this reason, alternative versions of the dichotomous RM i factor were employed in reiterative applications of model 4. For example, the regression was run using RM i equal to 1 if the company’s return on assets exceeded the median value. The only major change was the loss of statistical signiﬁcance for the size factor at a ¼ 0:05. (The new p-value was 0.078.) In another iteration, the data were ranked in quartiles according to market value. For each company, RM i was set equal to 1 if its return on assets exceeded its quartile’s median. In this iteration, each of the PRi; Sizei, and XF i factors was statistically signiﬁcant at a ¼ 0:05. Finally, RM i was set equal to 1 if the company’s return on assets was greater than zero as in Neu et al. (1998). In this application, the external ﬁnancing and size variables remained signiﬁcant at a ¼ 0:05, but the press release factor was not. (None of these results are shown in this paper.) In all of these iterations the performance measure and the interactive term PRi* RM i remained statistically insigniﬁcant. Possibly RM i needs to be redeﬁned so as to make a sharper distinction between good and poor performance. For example, if good (or poor) ﬁnancial performance were deﬁned to be the upper (or lower) quartile of the ﬁnancial performance range, the data might reﬂect Ullmann’s hypothesized relationship of ﬁnancial performance with strategic posture and disclosure. An analysis of this sort, however, would best be performed with a larger sample of companies. (ii) Exclusion of item G from the disclosure score Item G (statements on current or potential environmental actions or lawsuits against the company), while a mandatory disclosure according to Canadian accounting standards, was initially counted in with DDisc (Discretionary or Non-Financial disclosure). Disclosure of item G is particularly difﬁcult to score since the absence of a clear statement could mean one of two things: either there were no such actions, or there were, but management decided to withhold the information. Given the equivocal interpretation, all statistical work was repeated with Score2i and DDisc – i redeﬁned to exclude item G, with no appreciable change in the results. (iii) Alternative press release period The accident may have caused some managers to alter the company’s strategic posture. Volume of press releases in the months before the accident might therefore be a better indication of management choice of active versus passive posture just before the accident. For this reason, a twelve-month period leading up to August 18, 1995 – the day before the accident occurred – was used to reassess the press release factor. The results of the new OLS regression are shown in Table IX. There is no appreciable difference between the results here and those obtained when press release activity was measured over the calendar year. However, the non-parametric Spearman’s Rank test Downloaded by University of North Carolina at Charlotte At 08:01 03 February 2017 (PT)AAAJ 19,4 558 Table IX. Regression analysis. Dependent variable: disclosure rating (A-G) (n ¼ 41) failed to support the ﬁnding of a systematic relationship between strategic posture and disclosure. This suggests that the determination of any such relationship is sensitive to the measurement period used to evaluate strategic posture. It makes sense, in that annual report disclosure decisions are made at year-end, which corresponds to the measurement period used in the original regression (Table IV). Given the gravity of the accident, and the perceived threat to the industry, it is possible that press release activity would increase immediately after the accident, at least for some companies. It is also possible that managers who previously made little effort to maintain a media presence could alter that strategy after the accident. In other words, the accident may have prompted a change in strategy. This paper does not test directly for a change in strategic posture, and this may be an interesting question for future work. Summary, conclusion and suggestions for future research The disclosure scores of a sample of Canadian gold mining companies are regressed against the number of company press releases, while controlling for size, ﬁnancial performance, and plans to access the capital markets. The objective is to test Ullmann’s hypothesis that the power of external stakeholders to control required resources, and a company’s strategic posture combined with ﬁnancial performance, should be viewed simultaneously when attempting to predict the company’s social responsibility disclosure policy (Ullmann, 1985). A broadly deﬁned disclosure score is used to assess environmental disclosure at the end of 1995, a year in which there was a major environmental accident in the mining industry. At such a time, stakeholder demands for information on environmental risk and management are likely to be high for companies in the industry. Press release activity is used as a measure of strategic posture – active versus passive – and the measurement period corresponds to calendar 1995. By interacting the ﬁnancial performance factor with strategic posture, the statistical model used in this paper elicits insights not considered in earlier explorations of legitimacy theory. Ullmann argues that when stakeholder power is high, companies with an active strategic posture make greater social responsibility disclosure (Ullmann, 1985). The ﬁndings in this paper support this view. Companies that maintain a media presence through press releases make more disclosures in their annual reports for the year of the accident than companies that operate quietly out of public view. There is no evidence, however, to support Ullmann’s claim that good ﬁnancial performance combined with an active strategic posture promotes the disclosure of discretionary or non-ﬁnancial Expected sign Coefﬁcient t-value þ / – þ þ þ þ / – 3.330 * * * 2.449 * * 3.281 * * * 2.227 * * – 0.870 Intercept PRi Sizei XFini ROAi B0i B1i B2i B4i B5i Notes: Signiﬁcant at: a ¼ 0:01* * * ; a ¼ 0:05* * ; a ¼ 0:10* ; R 2 ¼ 0:35.

More data is needed to fully explore the role of ﬁnancial performance, as there may have been an insufﬁcient number of observations to effectively distinguish good from poor performance. One way to expand the data would be to allow companies that mine for base metals into the sample. Base metal mining companies are equally affected by a legislative backlash that follows an accident at a gold mine, so by limiting the sample to gold and silver mining companies, this analysis may have imposed an unnecessary restriction. The disclosure score used in this paper includes measures of ﬁnancial versus qualitative, forward-looking versus historic, and mandatory versus discretionary items. This type of score provides greater insight into the subtle nature of impressions management than is permitted by the measure of volume used in several earlier studies. When score components consisting of mandatory ﬁnancial items on the one hand, and non-ﬁnancial or discretionary items on the other, were individually regressed against the independent variables, the ﬁnancing factor was statistically signiﬁcant for the latter regression only. Given the latitude that managers have over the extent and form of disclosure outside professional and regulatory requirements, this ﬁnding makes intuitive sense, and supports the suggestion by Walden and Schwartz (1997) that companies rely on non-ﬁnancial disclosure when they need to shape stakeholder impressions. In this paper, the disclosure factor was designed to assess the presence or absence of different types of information, but not the extensiveness of that information. Many of the items in the scoring factor used in this paper correspond to speciﬁc CICA disclosure items. These items were either disclosed, or they were not, suggesting that a dichotomous scale is appropriate. However one of the non-ﬁnancial items, item A, relates to compliance with environmental regulation. Disclosure here could consist of a lengthy, detailed narrative. Alternatively, the discussion could be vague, or altogether missing. A more reﬁned measuring system that acknowledges the extensiveness of information disclosure could possibly have produced different results from those observed in this study. Future research might use some alternative measure for strategic posture. In this paper, no effort was made to distinguish companies that use the press to establish their strategic posture from companies that rely on some other form of media. Furthermore, the content of the press communication was not taken into consideration. The question of whether the repercussions of the Omai accident prompted a change in strategic posture is also an interesting one to explore. However, given that Ullmann’s contingency framework tried to explain corporate decisions regarding actual social performance, as well as disclosure about that performance, the next logical step is for future research to incorporate a measure of environmental performance. The Canadian economy offers a good platform for this sort of work. Canada’s resource-dependent economy, along with its ﬂexible accounting disclosure regime, offers considerable opportunity for further exploration in corporate impressions management strategy. Note 1. This seven-point rating system was developed and applied in Magness, 2001. In that paper, item B – existence of a high level environmental committee – was found to modify share price response in the wake of a similar mining accident in the Philippines in 1996. Klassen and McLaughlin also present evidence that high-level commitment to environmental management is value relevant (Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996).
