Chen and Richard W. Metcalf  ARECENT study [Spicer, 1978] high-  ~/1~ lighted the responsiveness of firms  to corporate social responsibility  and important financial indicators in  stock investment decisions. That study  purported to test the relationship of  pollution indices to five financial indi-  cators. The five financial indicators used  were: (1) profitability, as measured by  the ratio of income available to common  stock equity; (2) size, as measured  by the total assets; (3) total risk, as  measured by the standard deviation of  periodic stock return; (4) systematic  risk, as measured by individual security  contribution to portfolio risk, repre-  sented by a portfolio index (Standard and  Poor's Composite Price Index); and (5)  price/earnings ratio.  Directional hypotheses were tested.  Through non-parametric testing pro-  cedures, Spicer concludes that there is  evidence substantiating existence of a  moderate to strong association between  the investment value of a company's  common shares and its social perfor-  mance record:  Specifically, it was found that, for a sample  drawn from the pulp and paper industry,  companies with better pollution-control rec-  ords tend to have higher profitability, larger  size, lower total risk, lower systematic risk  and higher price/earnings ratios than com-  panies with poorer pollution-control records  [Spicer, 1978, p. 109].  Unfortunately, the result is still not as  strong as expressed in Spicer's statement.  The purpose of this paper is to show (1)  that the evidence is not as definitive as  Spicer indicated, and (2) that the evidence  rests on spurious relationships created  through one or more intervening vari-  ables. The reported significant associ-  ations might not have been observed had  the effect of intervening variables been  controlled (or adjusted). An outline on  constructing a model, based upon statis-  tical relationships, is presented to facili-  tate discussion. This is followed by an  analysis of the relationship among vari-  ables included in Spicer's study.  We wish to thank the editor and anonymous reviewers  for their many helpful comments and suggestions.  Kung H. Chen and Richard W.

CORRELATION AND SPURIOUS  RELATIONSHIP  Existence of a significant coefficient of  correlation between two variables X and  Y, for example, often serves as evidence  of an association between X and Y and  warrants the use of X as a predictor of  Y's magnitude. Furthermore, if sup-  ported by theory, X can be regarded as a  cause of Y. 1 In any empirical study,  conclusions and further references are  valid, however, only if the relationship is  not spurious. A significant association  created through a spurious empirical  relationship is meaningless in testing  predictability.  Relationships Among Variables  Observed relationships among vari-  ables can be genuine or spurious. A  spurious relationship between two vari-  ables X and Y exists if a third variable Z  causes, either directly or indirectly, both  X and Y and there is no direct relation-  ship between X and Y. To clarify rela-  tionships among variables, consider the  cases of three variables.2 Let Y be the  dependent variable or the variable whose  value is of ultimate interest in the investi-  gation, and let X and Z be the variables  whose relationships with Y are the focus  of the study. Figure 1 exemplifies possible  relationships among these variables. A  directional arrow denotes existence of  direct effect from one variable to the  other. Lack of a directional arrow be-  tween two variables indicates that any  relationship between the variables shown  ' Statisticians carefully point out that correlation  analysis cannot be used directly to establish causality be-  cause of the fact that correlations merely measure co-  variation or the degree to which several variables vary  together. In employing correlation analysis, a researcher  is, at least implicitly, assuming the existence of casual  relationships among variables being correlated. As  Blalock points out, one of the basic aims of any science  is to establish causal relations. "Regardless of one's  philosophical reservations concerning the notions of  cause and effect, it is extremely difficult to think theoreti-  cally in any other terms" [Blalock, 1960, p. 337].  2 Similar analyses can be made for cases with more  than three variables. Readers interested in detailed dis-  cussions on general cases are referred to works by Blalock  [1962, 1964, 1968] and Simon [1957 ].

Possible relation-  ships, represented by the dotted lines,  may or may not exist. It seems that based  on the Spicer's discussions, none of the  dotted lines are assumed to exist since he  did not indicate the possible existence of  any variable having the characteristics  of Z.  in a correlation analysis is spurious.3  Using the variables included in the  Spicer study, X is one of the pollution  control indices, Y is one of the financial  indicators, and Z can be either one of the  financial indicators not designated as Y  or a variable that was not included, even  though it should have been. In diagram  (a), no relationship exists between any  pair of variables X, Y, and Z, whereas (b)  indicates that X has a direct effect on Y.  Other variables, as represented by Z,  have only random effects on both X and  Y. The relationship represented in (f) is  that both X and Y are affected by Z and  any relationship shown between X and Y  is spurious even though it reflects the  common effect of Z on both X and Y. The  three-arrow diagrams (i) and (j) indicate  that both variables X and Z have direct  effects on the variable Y, whereas one of  the variables X and Z also has direct  effects on the other variable.  (1) Correlation Coefficients and Relation-  ships Among Variables  With this clarification of possible rela-  tionships among variables, the next ques-  tion is which model depicted in Figure I  best describes the true relationship  among X, Y, and Z? To distinguish  among various models, it is necessary to  examine the relative magnitudes of the  Clarification of Relationships  In the discussion and conclusion in the  Spicer paper, it is implied that the rela-  tionships between a firm's performance  on pollution control X and its financial  3 Two-way arrows are excluded in these diagrams.  Through a careful selection of events in a time sequence,  the effect can be placed in one direction or the other but  not mutually effected simultaneously.  4 Conceivably, (e) and (f) can be included also. How-  ever, the relationship between X and Y in these two  diagrams is spurious, by definition.

One should take care, however,  in distinguishing relationships such as  those represented by (e) and (g) or by (f)  and (h). In these models a common  background factor affects the other inde-  pendent variable and this may or may  not directly affect Y. As an example,  relationships depicted in cases (f) and  (h) are quite distinct. In (h), the variable  X has a direct effect on Y, while the  relationship between X and Y in (f) is  spurious, even though both have Z as a  common background factor. In both of  these cases, the control of variations in Z  weakens the relationships between X and  Y. Such a control may reduce the effect  of X on Y to the extent that significant  relationships between X and Yin (f) and  (h) no longer exist. In the case of (h),  such inference is incorrect.  To avoid reaching an erroneous con-  clusion from observing correlation coeffi-  cients among pairs of variables in ascer-  taining the model that depicts the true  relationships, it is necessary also to  compare regression coefficients. A con-  trol of variations in the common factor  may cause a significant correlation coeffi-  cient to become statistically insignificant,  whereas the significant relationship in  correlation coefficients among pairs of  variables. For the first three, (a), (b), and  (c) models, the magnitudes of correlation  coefficients among variables dictate  which model represents the relationships  among variables. In (d), both X and Z  have effects on Y, while there is no direct  relationship between X and Z. Since X  and Z are independent, Z is a disturbing  factor (from the point of view of the  relationship between X and Y). A con-  trol5 of the variations in Z reduces ran-  dom variations in Y with respect to the  variations in X and makes the relation-  ship between X and Y most distinct.  Control of variations in Z increases the  magnitude of correlation between X and  Y. If the control is achieved, through  adjusting for the effects of Z on X and Y,  then it is expected that the partial corre-  lation Pxy.z will be greater than the zero-  order correlations Pxy.  In cases (e) and (f), control of vari-  ations in Z weakens the relationship  between X and Y. In fact, if Z is the  background factor that affects both X  and Y, and if the relationship between X  and Y is spurious, the control of Z  causes the relationship between X and Y  to approach zero. Similar results can be  expected between Y and Z in (g) and (h),  if variations of X are controlled. In (i)  and (j), control of an independent vari-  able does not weaken the relationship  between Y and the other independent  variable to the extent that no relationship  exists. This is because X has a direct  effect on Yin (i), for example, and control  of variations in Z will not weaken signifi-  cantly the relationship between X and Y.  If control of variations in Z weakens the  relationship between X and Y to the  extent that a significant relationship  between X and Y no longer exists, then  the appropriate model is not (i), rather,  it should be (e).6  I To control the effect of a third variable on two or  more variables that are of interest in an investigation, it  is ideal to investigate the relation between two variables  within categories of the third variable. The large sample  required usually renders such a procedure impractical.  The term "control" referred to here and in the remainder  of the paper is a control through partial correlation.  Partial correlation "controls" by adjusting values of the  other variables through considering the scores of the  third (control) variable.  6 A detailed discussion of these analyses is presented  by Blalock, especially in Blalock [1960, pp. 329-343].

The null hypothesis would be rejected  even less often if a more stringent signifi-  cance level (say, .01) were used.  Pollution Control and Profitability  In assessing the results of the empirical  tests, consider this fundamental ques-  tion: Is it logical to expect the perfor-  mance on pollution control to have  significant effects on profitability of  operations, size of the firms, variations of  periodic returns on stock investments,  extent of price variations that can be  explained by market factors, and price/  earnings ratios? A test of association is  meaningless unless the answer for each  of the related variables to the pollution  control indices is affirmative. Conceiv-  ably, performance in pollution control  can have effects on security prices. This  effect will be reflected in the measures of  total risk, systematic risk, and price/  earnings ratio. It is difficult to see, how-  ever, why a firm's pollution control  record would have positive, significant  effects on the result of operations and  size of the firm.  Typically, management is reluctant to  incur expenditures for pollution abate-  ment on the ground that these additional  expenditures would reduce the reported  earnings in financial statements. Yet this  is the basis for the measure of profitability  used by Spicer. Economically, a firm with  regression coefficients is not affected.  This occurs even if a direct relationship  were to exist between the dependent and  independent variables. In this case, both  the partial correlation coefficient Pxy.z  and the regression coefficient IBIS z ap-  proach zero in (f), whereas only the  partial correlation coefficient Pxy.z ap-  proaches zero in (h) (Blalock, 1968, pp.  175-6).  A FURTHER ANALYSIS OF ASSOCIATION  BETWEEN POLLUTION CONTROL INDICES  AND FINANCIAL INDICATORS  Validity of Spicer Study  Spicer applies two different tests to  data from 1968 to 1973. Financial vari-  ables of this period are averaged over  three overlapping periods: 1968-73,  1969-71, and 1971-73. Two pollution  indices, one based on percentage of pro-  ductive capacity adequately controlled  and the other on percentage of mills  adequately controlled, are constructed  for the years 1970 and 1972. Twelve test  statistics are reported for each financial  variable. In each case, detailed levels of  significance at which the null hypothesis  of no correlation between the perfor-  mance on pollution control and the  financial indicators can be rejected are  reported.  The results reported in the Spicer  study were examined using .05 as the  level for testing significance.7 Our exami-  nation reveals that Spicer's conclusion  "that ... companies with better pollu-  tion-control records tend to have higher  profitability, larger size, lower total risk,  lower systematic risk and higher price/  earnings ratios than companies with  poorer pollution-control records" (p.  109) is far from justified. At the .05 level  of significance, such a conclusion can be  drawn only for three of the five financial  variables: profitability, size, and price/  earnings ratios. The result of tests of  ' It is not clear what level of significance should be  used in assessing the results reported. Labovitz [19681  suggests 11 criteria that should be considered by re-  searchers in selecting the level of significance for testing  hypotheses. The .05 level of significance was used in the  table because Spicer seemed, more or less, to suggest this  level of significance in his discussions [Spicer, 1978, pp.  105 and 1081.

Although such a relation-  ship yields a significant association be-  tween pollution control record and profit-  ability, the relationship is meaningless  for the purpose of Spicer's study-to  provide empirical evidence on the impor-  tance of disclosing a company's social  performance record. A positive conclu-  sion for the research question addressed  can be drawn only if an improvement  in pollution control leads to better prof-  itability of the firm. Spicer's reported  evidence did not show the temporal  sequence of better pollution control lead-  ing to a higher profit.  Size Effect  The same relationship expected be-  tween pollution control record and profit-  ability should also exist between pollu-  tion control record and size of operation.  It hardly seems possible for the result of  controlling pollution to have a positive  effect on the size of operation. Rather,  with the visibility of larger firms8 and the  severe effects of pollution from large  operations on the environment, a large  firm tends to do more, either voluntarily  or involuntarily, on pollution control.  Size of operation, moreover, may have  a significant effect on the other four  financial indicators included in Spicer's  study. Supporting this idea is a study  investigating the relationship between  various accounting and market-based  measures (Beaver et al., 1970), which  found that market-based risk measures  correlated negatively with asset size, as  measured by the firm's total assets.  Exactly the same relationship between  these variables is expected to exist in the  data reported in the Spicer study. The  results show that the pollution indices  have positive associations with size of  firm, whereas the same indices have  negative associations with the market-  based risk measures. In other words, size  may be a background factor that causes  significant association between pollution  control indices and each of the other four  financial indicators. Referring to Figure  1, such a relationship is represented by  diagrams (f), (h), and (j), with Z denoting  size, X denoting a pollution control  index, and Y denoting one of the other  four financial indicators included in the  study. Conceivably, diagram (d) may also  represent the relationship. In (d), both  size and pollution control have signifi-  cant effects on the financial indicators,  whereas no significant relationship exists  between pollution control index and  size-a situation rejected on the basis of  strong association between these two  variables reported by Spicer [1978, pp.  105-108].  Replicating the Study  Further analyses are needed to sepa-  rate models (f) and (h). These analyses  require use of product-moment correla-  tions between size and other financial  indicators. Since these data are not  available in Spicer (1978), the procedures  described in the Spicer paper were fol-  lowed to obtain financial variables. To  ensure that these data conform with those  reported by Spicer, the Spearman rank-  order correlation tests were made. With  minor differences in magnitudes of corre-  lation coefficients, the results in the levels  of significance are essentially the same as  obtained by Spicer [1978, pp. 105-107].  Spicer used non-parametric statistics  because he was concerned that the data  might not satisfy the strict assumptions  8 Evidence of the effect of firm size on managerial be-  havior was reported recently. It was found that the  single most important factor explaining managerial  behavior with regard to the proposed general price level  adjustments of the Financial Accounting Standards  Board is firm size [Watts and Zimmerman, 1978, p. 1311.

Yet,  parametric tests are needed to determine  the relationships among these variables.  There is extremely strong evidence-  both mathematical and empirical-that  parametric tests are very robust under  violation of assumptions (see, e.g.,  Boneau [1960], Lord [1953], Anderson  [1961], and Baker et al. [1966]). As a test  on suitability of the product-moment  correlation coefficients for further analy-  ses in this study, hypotheses were tested  using the product-moment correlation  coefficients.  Comparison of the coefficients and  levels of significance between those from  the Spearman rank-order correlation  procedure and those from product-  moment correlation procedure reveals  almost identical results. These results  agree with Boneau's finding on the effect  of violating the normality assumption  [Boneau, 1960, p. 62].  Visualizing the Relationships  To determine whether the size variable,  Z, is a background factor for the signifi-  cant association between pollution in-  dices, X, and one of the other four finan-  cial indicators, Y, either variations in Z  need to be controlled or the effects of  variations of Z on the other two variables  need to be adjusted. If Z is a dominant  background factor for the other two  variables, then the adjustment of the  effects of Z on X and Y causes the partial  correlation pxy.z to approach zero. If the  relationship is like the one depicted in  diagrams (b) or (d), then the observed  significant association between X and Y  remains even though variations in Z are  held constant statistically. Table 1 re-  ports the result of tests of association  between pollution indices and financial  indicators, holding the effects of size  variations constant. Compare these re-  sults with those reported in Spicer [1978].  The results indicate that the conclusion  of a moderate to strong association  between pollution control record and  financial indicators is not justified. At the  .05 level of significance, the null hypothe-  sis of no relationship between a pollution  index and a financial indicator cannot be  rejected in any case; only four out of a  total of 24 cases can be rejected if the  level of significance is increased to .10.  This is true when the effect of size on  these two variables was adjusted. Conse-  quently, it is highly improbable that  either (b) or (d) represents the relation-  ship among the pollution indices, size of  operation, and one of the other four  financial indicators. Our analyses sug-  gest that the relationships among these  variables is as described in Figure 3.  Relationships represented by the dotted  lines in Figure 3 may or may not exist. If  the line between X and Y does not, in  fact, exist, then the relationship is de-  picted by (f); if the line between Z and Y  does not exist while the directed arrow  between Xand Yexists, then the relation-  ship is represented by (h); if both dotted  lines exist, then the relationship is the  one described by (j).  If the relationship is (h) or (j), then a  control for Z weakens the correlation  between X and Y but does not affect the  expected value of the regression coeffi-  cient between X and Y, to the extent that  it becomes insignificant. If the relation-  ship is (f), a control for Z will weaken  both the correlation coefficient and the  regression coefficient [Blalock, 1968, pp.  175-76]. Thus, there is a means to dis-  criminate between these relationships.

The  argument that X has a direct effect on Y,  mediates the effect of Z on Y, or com-  pletely contains the effect of Z on Y, is not  substantiated. The appropriate relation-  ship is the one represented by (f), in that  size is an explanatory variable for both  pollution control and financial indi-  cators.  An examination of data over time  gives additional evidence of the spurious  relationship between pollution indices  and financial indicators. Although Spicer  found statistically significant association  at the .05 level on three out of the five  measures with the 1970 pollution control  indices, the same results are not obtained  when 1972 pollution control indices were  correlated with financial data of a later  period. Spicer reasoned that the differ-  ence resulted from substantial improve-  ments in pollution control between 1970  and 1972. Although the general levels of  pollution control of the companies stud-  ied have improved, not all companies  have the same pollution record. The rank  correlation of pollution indices between  1970 and 1972 shows that the null hy-  pothesis of no correlation can be rejected  at the .01 level of significance. Further-  more, the ranges of variation in these  two years do not have substantial differ-  ences. It can be expected that if the  variations in pollution indices have a  legitimate relationship with the financial  indicators, the same results would be ob-  tained in data of the two time periods.  Pollution indices in both 1970 and 1972  vary over wide ranges. The fact that the  associations of pollution indices with the  financial indicators in the second time  period (1971-73) are not significant sug-  gests that the significant association ob-  served in the first time period (1969-71)  might result from the effects of other  variables.

This result  is in direct conflict with Spicer's conclu-  sions. It is highly improbable that the  data suggest the importance of the dis-  closure of corporate social responsibility  performance.  By no means is size the only possible  background factor. Several other vari-  ables (financial and economic) are known  to affect the financial indicators included  in Spicer's study. A clearer picture would  have been provided were effects of other  background factors considered in  Spicer's analysis.  The result of this study should not be  interpreted as evidence that investors  are indifferent in regard to corporate  social performance. An investor's pri-  mary concern is return on his investment,  and a concern for pollution control is  relevant to the extent that failure to have  adequate pollution control endangers  earnings of the firm. As long as a firm has  a satisfactory performance on pollution  control, there is no reason for investors  to be concerned. Any negative effect of  pollution control performance on finan-  cial indicators is, perhaps, confined to  firms with poor pollution control records.
