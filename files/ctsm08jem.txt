It is usually assumed that SMEs lack the resources to implement proactive environmental strategies that go beyond minimum regulatory compliance. In this study of 108 SMEs in the automotive repair sector in Southern Spain, we found that SMEs undertake a range of environmental strategies from reactive regulatory compliance to proactive pollution prevention and environmental leadership. These strategies are associated with three organizational capabilities: shared vision, stakeholder management, and strategic proactivity, hypothesized based on the unique strategic characteristics of SMEs—shorter lines of communication and closer interaction within the SMEs, the presence of a founder’s vision, ﬂexibility in managing external relationships, and an entrepreneurial orientation. We also found that ﬁrms with the most proactive practices exhibited a signiﬁcantly positive ﬁnancial performance. r 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction require urgent Global environmental problems such as climate change that solutions have increased societal awareness about the impact of business operations on the natural environment. Scholars have expressed concern about the difﬁculty of achieving real environmental improvements if the current social paradigms and norma- tive frameworks that guide business decision-making remain unaltered (e.g. Newton and Harte, 1997).

While we recognize the complementarity and importance of both perspectives, in this study we adopt a strategic focus in an under-researched context: small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Research on organizations and the natural environment from the resource-based view of the ﬁrm (Barney, 1991; Rumelt, 1984; Wernerfelt, 1984) has shown that proactive corporate environmental strategies that go beyond regula- tory compliance have a positive effect on corporate ﬁnancial performance when mediated by valuable organi- zational capabilities (e.g. Christmann, 2000; Hart, 1995; Marcus and Geffen, 1998; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma ARTICLE IN PRESS J.A. Arago´n-Correa et al. / Journal of Environmental Management 86 (2008) 88–103 89 and Vredenburg, 1998; Wagner, 2005). Studies have also usually found that ﬁrm size has a signiﬁcant effect on the degree of proactiveness, with larger organizations being more likely to adopt proactive environmental practices (e.g. Arago´ n-Correa, 1998; Buysse and Verbeke, 2003; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma, 2000). The ﬁndings that show that ﬁrm size affects the proactiveness of environmental strategies have perhaps led to an assumption that SMEs’ lack of resources prevents them from implementing proactive strategies and that such initiatives may reduce their proﬁtability (e.g. Russo and Fouts, 1997; Rutherfoord et al., 2000; Schaper, 2002). It may therefore lead to the assumption that the ‘natural resource-based view of the ﬁrm’ (Hart, 1995) may not be a useful perspective for SMEs. However, the above studies only include populations of large companies in their samples. Although some cases suggest that environmental policy in lesser-developed countries should develop to enable small-scale and artisan ﬁrms to form entities that are of a sufﬁciently large scale to allow ade- quate environmental protection (Tarras-Wahlberg, 2002); this option is not necessarily useful for competitive markets in developed countries. Therefore, it cannot be con- cluded from the available that SMEs are not likely to adopt proactive environmental strategies or even that they may not possess valuable organizational capabilities that enable them to generate such strategies. empirical evidence impact of SMEs have also not been the focus of environmental strategy research based on arguments about their presumed lack of interest in going beyond regulatory compliance (Greening and Gray, 1994; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998), the low degree of public interest in SMEs (Scott, 1990), and the difﬁculty of obtaining data from SMEs (Arago´ n-Correa, 1998; Rutherfoord et al., 2000). However, SMEs produce around 70% of the total global pollution (Smith and Kemp, 1998), 60% of the total carbon emissions (Marshall, 1998), and the sum total of SMEs’ environmental impacts outweighs the combined environmental (Hillary, 2000). Therefore, it is imperative that such assumptions about the lower importance of studying environmental strategies of SMEs be based on empirical data rather than on conjecture. There is also broad agreement in the strategic management literature that the strategic distinctiveness of SMEs makes research focused in this context necessary (e.g. Barney et al., 2001; Dean et al., 1998; Way, 2002). Thus, strategic differences between big and small ﬁrms, the scope of SMEs’ impacts on the global economy and on the natural environment, and the absence of previous analysis, all suggest the importance of giving detailed attention to the issue of the strategic behaviour of SMEs in their interface with the natural environment. large ﬁrms Accordingly, in this study we develop an organizational size-dependent perspective that links the unique strategic characteristics of SMEs—shorter lines of communication and closer interaction within the SMEs, the presence of a founder’s vision, ﬂexibility in managing external relation- ships, and an entrepreneurial orientation—to the organiza- tional capabilities that they are likely to develop and deploy to generate proactive environmental strategies. Our organizational size-dependent natural resource-based view for SMEs addresses two questions: (1) Based on the unique strategic characteristics of SMEs, which are the organiza- tional capabilities likely to be associated with their proactive environmental strategies? and (2) What effect do such proactive environmental strategies have on the ﬁnancial and competitive performance of these SMEs? We contribute to both: the natural resource-based view by showing that SMEs can adopt proactive environmental strategies based on speciﬁc capabilities associated with their unique strategic characteristics, and the resource- based view by identifying the type of organizational capabilities that are likely to help SMEs develop their competitive strategies in general. 2. Strategies of SMEs 2.1. Strategic management literature and SMEs Despite the widespread recognition of the signiﬁcant role that SMEs play in most economies, the com- petitive strategies of SMEs have attracted limited re- search effort as compared to the focus on large ﬁrms. This may be partly because early studies using the PIMS database (e.g. Strategic Planning Institute, 1977) re- inforced the idea that large ﬁrms possessed numerous advantages over smaller ﬁrms, and espoused the virtue of growth-oriented strategies. SMEs were often margin- alized as a residual class of ﬁrms that failed to become big, that frequently used old fashioned managerial approaches, that occupied secondary labour markets and niches (Scranton, 1999), and/or that were less likely to use strategic analysis and planning practices (e.g. Shuman et al., 1985). Later studies showed that certain advantages might also accrue to smaller ﬁrms (e.g. Woo, 1987) and accordingly research began to focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of different strategies and practices for SMEs’ performance (e.g. Risseeuw and Masurel, 1994). It was argued that SMEs could gain advantage via focused (e.g. Brown, 1995; Porter, 1980) or ﬂexible strategies for producing specialty products/services for niche markets (Lescure, 1999) as the only viable competitive options given their lack of resources (Lee et al., 1999). 2.2. Strategic characteristics of SMEs Although the dominant perspective on SMEs has emphasized their lack of resources (e.g. D’Amboise and Muldowney, 1988; Eden et al., 1997), recent literature has proposed that SMEs possess certain characteristics such as internally generated funds, a simple capital structure, and an entrepreneurial orientation of the founders/managers 90 J.A. Arago´n-Correa et al. / Journal of Environmental Management 86 (2008) 88–103 ARTICLE IN PRESS (Rangone, 1999; Yu, 2001), that can contribute to competitive advantage. It has also been argued that SMEs possess the ﬂexibility to respond to changes in the general innovativeness to respond with business environment, agility to competitors’ moves, and closer interaction amongst organizational employees. Each of these char- acteristics is discussed below. Flexibility is probably the most widely cited among SME characteristics (e.g. Chen and Hambrick, 1995; Fiegenbaum and Karnani, 1991; Yu, 2001). Flexi- bility allows SMEs to pay greater attention to managing external relationships upon which they are dependant for critical resources to survive, more so than larger ﬁrms with larger internal resources. These include inter- ﬁrm relationships (especially where SMEs are sub-contrac- to large companies), tors or parts/services personal relationships them with new market opportunities (Hendry et al., 1995; Conner and Prahalad, 1996), and relationships with government agencies subsidies and technical assistance for small enterprises (Darnall, 2002). suppliers that provide attracting for identifying and Entrepreneurial orientation and innovativeness have also been cited as important characteristics of small ﬁrms (e.g. Hitt et al., 1991; Woo, 1987). However, given that SMEs have limited human resources, the competitive advantage from these characteristics depends mainly on the managers-founder’s vision and her ability to extend her views to the rest of the employees (Merz and Sauber, 1995; Miller et al., 1988) and motivate their opportunity-seeking and problem solving behaviour. Finally, small ﬁrms may also be distinguished from large ones in terms of the closer interaction among departments, shorter lines of communication, better personal links, more uniﬁed culture and stronger identity. While these features permit easier communications and the generation of shared understanding (Kogut and Zander, 1996), they may also create problems due to the greater intensity of personal interactions if shared values and vision are not sufﬁciently strong (Lawrence and Lorsch, 1969). In summary, while the literature on SME strategies has traditionally focused on efﬁcacy problems because of small ﬁrms’ potential lack of recourses, conﬂicting evidence for this argument has been found (Chen and Hambrick, 1995). We argue that the unique characteristics of SMEs’ enable them to develop and deploy certain organizational capabilities which may be one of the main reasons for these paradoxical ﬁndings. Accordingly, the following section develops arguments, from a re- source-based view of the ﬁrm, to link the three character- istics discussed above—shorter lines of communication and closer interaction within the SMEs, the presence of a founder’s vision, the ﬂexibility in managing ext- ernal relationships, and entrepreneurial orientation—with the generation of proactive environmental strategies, and the relationship of such strategies with SMEs’ perfor- mance. 3. A size-dependent perspective on SMEs’ environmental strategy 3.1. Corporate environmental strategies In spite of differences in nomenclature, typologies of corporate environmental strategy place ﬁrms’ environmen- tal strategies along a continuum ranging from reactive strategies that merely aim to meet legal requirements and implement pollution controls, to more proactive strategies that include voluntary eco-efﬁcient practices for reducing energy and waste and pollution prevention practices that require innovations in processes, products and operations to reduce energy and material use at to environmental leadership strategies where products, pro- cesses, and even business models are re-designed to minimize the ecological footprint along the entire product life cycle (Arago´ n-Correa, 1998; Buysse and Verbeke, 2003; Hart, 1995; Roome, 1992; Sharma, 2000; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). the source, A proactive environmental strategy requires changes in routines and operations and has been identiﬁed as an organizational competence (e.g. Christmann, 2000; Hart, 1995) because it requires the complex coordination of several human and technical skills and heterogeneous resources (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993) in order to reduce environmental impacts and simultaneously maintain or increase ﬁrm competitiveness. Extant research based on samples of only larger ﬁrms has shown that organizations with a larger size are more likely to undertake the most proactive environmental strategies (Arago´ n-Correa, 1998; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma, 2000). Scholars have consequently argued that because proactive environmental strategies require accumulation of, and complex interaction among, skills and resources such as physical assets, technologies, and people (Ramus and Steger, 2000; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma, 2000; Shrivastava, 1995), SMEs’ limited resources might prevent them from adopting such practices (e.g. Greening and Gray, 1994; Russo and Fouts, 1997). Although a curvilinear relationship between ﬁrm size and environmental strategy may be possible based on potential synergies between complementary assets (Christ- mann, 2000), the lack of ﬂexibility of large ﬁrms, and the limited resources of very small ﬁrms,1 to our knowledge there is no evidence to support this relationship. The extant literature supports a linear relationship considering that big ﬁrms have greater access to the resources required for the implementation of the proactive environmental strategies. This generalized impression of SMEs has persisted although systematic research on SMEs’ environmental strategies has been absent from extant literature. Support- ing this assumption, descriptive studies of SMEs have often highlighted their poor level of environmental commitment, describing them as mainly interested in controlling emis- 1We thank our reviewers for suggesting this idea as potential research for the future. ARTICLE IN PRESS J.A. Arago´n-Correa et al. / Journal of Environmental Management 86 (2008) 88–103 91 sions of pollution to comply with environmental regula- tions (e.g. Rutherfoord et al., 2000; Schaper, 2002; Williamson and Lynch-Wood, 2001). However, a few descriptive studies in several countries contradict this assumption and have shown that SMEs may successfully implement environmental strategies con- sistent with the advanced environmental practices of big ﬁrms (e.g. Bianchi and Noci, 1998; Carlson-Skalak, 2000; Hillary, 2000) including innovations that prevent pollution at the source rather than pollution control at the end-of- the-pipe. Therefore, we argue that, contrary to the current dominant thinking about SME environmental strategies as being mainly reactive, they are also likely to exhibit proactive strategies based on certain organizational cap- abilities related to the unique strategic characteristics of SMEs. 3.2. Organizational capabilities for SMEs’ proactive environmental strategies Drawing on the natural resource-based view of the ﬁrm (e.g. Hart, 1995) and the unique characteristics of SMEs discussed above, we present arguments and develop hypotheses in this section for the capabilities that will be associated with SMEs’ proactive environmental strategies based on a ﬁt with their unique characteristics discussed in the strategic management literature. These capabilities are (1) shared vision, which is related to the owner-founder’s vision and the close interaction and communication between the owner–founder and the organizational mem- bers; (2) strategic proactivity which is related to SME’s entrepreneurial orientation and innovativeness; and (3) stakeholder management, which is related to SMEs ﬂexibility in managing their inter-organizational and external relationships. These three capabilities have also been analysed in the natural resource-based view literature, which is predominantly based on large ﬁrm samples (e.g. Arago´ n-Correa and Sharma, 2003; Christmann, 2000; Marcus and Geffen, 1998; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). Our contribution in this study is to develop a theoretical basis to identify a subset of the several capabilities discussed in the literature that are relevant and more likely for SMEs for developing proactive environ- mental strategies. 3.2.1. Shared vision The organizational capability of shared vision exists when an organization’s members collectively have similar values and beliefs about its objectives and mission (Oswald et al., 1994). The capability of shared vision does not simply mean that employees know their managers’ objectives; rather, shared vision entails a shared feeling that the ﬁrm’s objectives are important and appropriate and that all of its members may contribute to deﬁning them. Goal clarity and shared responsibility for organiza- tional objectives are two basic characteristics of shared learning and vision and positively affect organizational employee creativity at the interface between business and the natural environment (Ramus and Steger, 2000). Hart (1995) proposed that ﬁrms having a demonstrated capability of shared vision would be able to accumulate the skills necessary for developing a proactive environmental strategy earlier than ﬁrms without such a capability because these strategies depend ‘‘upon tacit skill develop- ment through employee involvement’’ (Hart, 1995, p. 999). Similarly, research on corporate environmental change argues for the importance of employee support in the SME context (Barret and Murphy, 1996; Ruiz-Quintanilla et al., 1996; Wehrmeyer and Parker, 1996) although the empirical evidence is mainly based on the large ﬁrms’ context (e.g. Andersson and Bateman, 2000; Ramus and Steger, 2000). On the positive side, as compared to large ﬁrms, SMEs may be burdened with less bureaucracy and fewer restrictions and provide more opportunities for direct communication and shared experiences amongst organiza- tional members (O’Gorman and Doran, 1999). On the negative side, SME managers have been shown to have difﬁculty developing clear objectives and communicating with subordinates owing to lack of resources and unprofessional management (Smeltzer and Fann, 1989; Way, 2002), and lack interest in analysis offered by employees during the process of setting precise objectives and in reaching consensus among managers and employees (Merz and Sauber, 1995). Therefore, size alone does not make a shared vision capability intrinsic to an SME. Rather, we argue that only the SMEs that are able to exploit close interactions between the owner-founder’s vision and employees into a capability of a shared vision for a sustainable business are more likely to implement a proactive environmental strategy. For instance, Raymond et al. is positively associated with the implementation of business process reengineering in SMEs. This leads us to argue that the importance of a shared vision capability for a proactive environmental strategy will be at least as high in SMEs as in larger organizations. Therefore: showed that organizational (1998) support Hypothesis 1. A capability of shared vision will be positively associated with the development of proactive environmental strategies by SMEs. 3.2.2. Stakeholder management Stakeholder pressures have often been cited as factors contributing to the adoption of proactive environmental practices by ﬁrms (e.g. Ce´ spedes-Lorente et al., 2003; Cordano et al., 2004; Henriques and Sadorsky, 1999; Sharma and Henriques, 2005; Wheeler et al., 2003). This literature has mostly offered empirical evidence in the large ﬁrm context for the importance of this capability for generating proactive environmental strategies. Sharma and Vredenburg (1998, p. 735) speciﬁcally deﬁned this capability as ‘‘the ability to establish trust- based collaborative relationships with a wide variety of stakeholders, especially those with non-economic goals’’. 92 J.A. Arago´n-Correa et al. / Journal of Environmental Management 86 (2008) 88–103 ARTICLE IN PRESS Henriques and Sadorsky (1999) showed that environmen- tally proactive ﬁrms usually view all their stakeholders as important and actively manage their environmental con- cerns and, for instance, Sharma and Henriques (2005) linked speciﬁc stakeholder pressures to speciﬁc sustain- ability practices by facilities in the Canadian forest products industry. Stakeholders such as environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) usually target larger ﬁrms (and not necessarily the worst polluters), because these ﬁrms are often the most likely to respond in order to avoid damage to their reputations (Bianchi and Noci, 1998; Greve, 1989). Small ﬁrms may enjoy a degree of anonymity and therefore might be able to avoid undertaking some environmental practices, if they are so inclined (Dean et al., 2000). However, SMEs that are interested in proactive environ- mental practices need to pay careful attention to their stakeholders’ interests. Although their small size provides them with ﬂexibility in responding to changes in the general business environment, small ﬁrms are also seriously challenged by unfavourable and hostile environments (Merz and Sauber, 1995). external resources SMEs have limited internal resources to survive hostility by external forces and are less likely than large ﬁrms to have access to media or publicity. Therefore, SMEs need an organizational ability to be sensitive to the preferences of, and collaborative with, relevant external groups to garner for adopting technologies, processes, and systems required for proactive environmen- tal practices. Understanding and managing societal con- cerns via engagement in trust-based relationships can help expand SME’s resources for undertaking proactive envir- onmental practices through environmental coalitions and alliances (Rondinelli and London, 2003), governmental technological help and grants (Darnall, 2002), participa- tion in green networks (Lehmann et al., 2005), and free consulting (Bianchi and Noci, 1998). Similarly, Flannery and May (2000, p. 646) found that, in a sample of 139 SMEs in the US metal-ﬁnishing industry, managers’ decisions and intentions concerning the treatment of hazardous wastewater were inﬂuenced positively by ‘‘their assessment of support from important others’’, that is external stakeholders. McEvily and Marcus (2005) showed how SMEs engaged their suppliers to develop capabilities for pollution prevention. Therefore: Hypothesis 2. A capability of stakeholder management will be positively associated with the development of proactive environmental strategies by SMEs. 3.2.3. Strategic proactivity strategic policies Strategic proactivity is a ﬁrm’s ability to initiate changes in its regarding its entrepreneurial, engineering, and administrative activities, rather than reacting to events (Arago´ n-Correa, 1998). The concept draws on the prospector orientation described in Miles and Snow’s (1978) typology and involves taking initiative to shape the general business environment to one’s own advantage (Chen and Hambrick, 1995). Proactiveness has been proposed as a key dimension (with innovation and risk taking) of an entrepreneurial orientation (Covin and Slevin, 1990; Lumpkin and Dess, 1996; Miller, 1987) and Stopford and Baden-Fuller (1994) showed that these dimensions help ﬁrms to gain new capabilities. inﬂuence of research regarding the Based on data from 105 large ﬁrms in different Spanish economic sectors, Arago´ n-Correa (1998) showed that strategic proactivity encouraged adoption of proactive natural environmental strategies. Although previous em- pirical strategic proactivity on environmental approaches has been mainly based on large companies, some evidence shows the importance of strategic proactivity for small ﬁrms. For example, Dean et al. (1998) showed that environmental regulation of speciﬁc activities or sectors tends to generally discourage SMEs’ presence but attracts speciﬁc kinds of proactive SMEs. This ﬁnding is especially interesting considering that small ﬁrms often show a greater propen- sity for action than their larger rivals (Chen and Hambrick, 1995). Moreover, entrepreneurial orientation and innova- tiveness are important characteristics of small ﬁrms (e.g. Hitt et al., 1991; Woo, 1987) seeking focused niche strategies in competitive markets dominated by large ﬁrms with deep pockets (Lescure, 1999; Lee et al., 1999). Therefore: Hypothesis 3. A capability of strategic proactivity will be positively associated with the development of proactive environmental strategies by SMEs. 3.3. The inﬂuence of proactive environmental strategy on SME performance Although there is mixed evidence regarding the inﬂuence of proactive environmental strategies on the ﬁnancial performance of the ﬁrms (e.g. Bansal, 2005; Christmann, 2000; Margolis and Walsh, 2003), the majority of the studies have found a positive relationship. This positive relationship in the context of large ﬁrms (e.g. Klassen and McLaughlin, 1996; Russo and Fouts, 1997) has been explained as a result of mutual inﬂuence between proactive environmental strategies and valuable competitive capabil- ities (Christmann, 2000; Hart, 1995; Majumdar and Marcus, 2001; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). The most proactive strategies focused on business redeﬁnition and innovation in products and processes to prevent pollution and waste at the source enable an organization to align itself with changes in its general business environment (Arago´ n-Correa and Shar- ma, 2003), and have been shown to be associated with lower costs, improved reputation, and generation of new organizational capabilities (Christmann, 2000; Hart, 1995; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). The adoption of mid- range environmental strategies focused on eco-efﬁciency to reduce energy and waste have been found to reduce ARTICLE IN PRESS J.A. Arago´n-Correa et al. / Journal of Environmental Management 86 (2008) 88–103 93 environmental impacts and simultaneously provide ﬁrms with competitive advantage through reduction of costs and addition of net value (Lehni, 2000; WBCSD, 2001). Although researchers have extensively examined the inﬂuence of environmental practices on large ﬁrms’ performance, studies of small ﬁrms’ environmental ap- proaches have often used varying dependent variables. For example, Flannery and May (2000) investigated the inﬂuences on shaping environmentally ethical decision intentions, and Dean and colleagues (1998, 2000) estimated the effect of environmental regulations on the formation of small US manufacturing establishments. The descriptive studies on SME environmental practices generally assume that legislative pressures are the only way to generate advanced environmental practices among small ﬁrms because environmental activities do not have any positive implications for SMEs’ performance (e.g. Rutherfoord et al., 2000). However, Miles et al. (1999) emphasized that the relationship between ﬁnancial performance and the adop- tion of environmental standards for SMEs needed further analysis. They stated that ‘‘it is reasonable to expect that competent management and a more proactive stance on environmental issues will be rewarded in the small business sector as well’’ (Miles et al., 1999, p. 120). Since organizational capabilities have been empirically found to mediate the link between environmental strategy and ﬁnancial performance in the context of large ﬁrms (e.g. Christmann, 2000; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998), we argue that small ﬁrms will reap similar beneﬁts. However, in this study, we did not examine these mediation effects and leave it for future research. We propose that there will also be a direct relationship between proactive environmental strategy and ﬁnancial perfor- mance based on the arguments presented above. Hypothesis 4. Proactive environmental strategies will be positively associated with ﬁnancial performance of SMEs. 4. Research method 4.1. Sample and procedures We used data from automotive garages, mainly truck and car repair and maintenance facilities in Southern Spain, to examine our hypotheses. The automobile industry has a major impact on the natural environment (e.g. Orsato et al., 2002) at each stage of its life cycle—from production, utilization and operation, repair and main- tenance, to ﬁnal disposal. The garages focus on repair and maintenance of automotive products which generates signiﬁcant environmental impacts such as noise, high levels of CO2 generation in tests, high levels of consumption of energy and water, use of contaminants and toxic materials such as chemicals and paint, and dangerous wastes. Consequently, this industry is receiving growing attention from legislators. We initially interviewed six managers and key members of an industry association of the automotive garage sector, three consultants, and two academics interested in the area. Data on SMEs’ environmental practices, performance, and their organizational capabilities are not available from published sources. Therefore, based on the interviews and extant literature, we developed a questionnaire to measure our constructs. The population for this study consisted of all the automotive garages (210 ﬁrms) located in the region of Southern Spain (including the provinces of Malaga, Granada, and Almeria). All these ﬁrms were designated SMEs according to ofﬁcial standards2 (European Commis- sion, 1999). By controlling for industry and geographical effects we limited our potential to draw broadly general- izable conclusions but this allowed us to control for extraneous confounding inﬂuences and focus on our variables of interest. Our secondary research suggests that the majority of the European automotive garages face a fairly homogeneous context in competitive and legal terms. Automotive garages also have many similarities with small ﬁrms in other sectors including intensive competition, complex regulation, and lack of resources—especially ﬁnancial—as compared to larger companies. Studies based on data gathered from SMEs usually tend to be inconclusive because of very low response rates (Merrit, 1998) or the difﬁculty that the respondents may have in interpreting answers to questions (Smith and Kemp, 1998). Therefore, we decided to administer the structured questionnaire personally via interviews with each informant. Additionally, because the vast majority of the CEOs were native Spanish speakers, the questionnaire was written in Spanish to avoid problems in interpretation. All the items are provided in the Appendix after translation into English. The personal survey administration took signiﬁcantly greater time and effort compared to mail surveys but allowed us to ensure the appropriate identity of the respondents and their understanding of the questions. These factors contributed to greater data accuracy and reliability. As is usual in strategic and environmental research (e.g. Banerjee, 2001; Cordano and Frieze, 2000; Christmann, 2000; Flannery and May, 2000; Sharma, 2000), data were collected from the general managers because they are the most knowledgeable about their organization as a whole and usually play a crucial role in designing environmental strategies, especially in the SME context. To reduce possible social desirability bias, we: (1) promised that our analyses would be aggregated and no organization would be identiﬁed individually; (2) randomly compared 2When the research was conducted, the European Commission’s deﬁnition of SME was based on companies with fewer than 250 employees with either an annual turnover not exceeding h40 million or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding h27 million (adjustments are made in these values regularly), and those that were independent with less than 25% of the capital or voting rights owned by one enterprise or jointly by several enterprises. 94 J.A.

Fourteen interviews were not used for this study because of missing values, leaving a ﬁnal sample of 108 interviews representing 51.42% of the contacted popula- tion. The sampled ﬁrms had an average size of six employees. We did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant differences between the descriptive characteristics of ﬁrms that were included in the study in terms of location, activities, and size versus the overall population. in larger for most of factor to account Although a single informant in each ﬁrm is often used in strategic management research due to the difﬁculty of obtaining multiple informants surveys, we recognize the potential for mono-method bias in our data. Therefore we increased the conﬁdence in our data by: (1) undertaking a factor analysis which showed the absence of a single general the covariance in our variables, indicating the absence of common method variance problems for our data (Podsak- off and Organ, 1986); (2) comparing self-evaluation of managers with competitors’ perceptions of their ﬁrms which allowed us to compare managers’ responses with external sources of well-informed evaluators (see footnote 2 for details); and (3) personally identifying qualiﬁed respondents and administering the questionnaires. Pre- vious literature has shown that the views of a single but well-qualiﬁed informant may better capture a ﬁrm’s approach as compared to the views of several respondents in the case of small organizations where relevant decisions are often highly centralized (Chandler and Hanks, 1993; Lyon et al., 2000). 4.2.

Environmental strategy Due to limited or non-availability of publicly available environmental performance data, a ﬁrm’s environmental strategy has been usually measured in terms of self- (e.g. Arago´ n-Correa, 1998; perceptions of managers Christmann, 2000; Flannery and May, 2000; Sharma, 2000; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). In our case, this was the only feasible approach since there are no publicly available data on environmental practices of garages in Spain. 3A random sample of 46 managers from our ﬁnal respondent ﬁrms was asked about the most visible environmental practices of one or several competitors (usually nearby garages), resulting in a sample of 70 externally evaluated ﬁrms. Averaging evaluations created external evaluations of speciﬁc ﬁrms when several of them were available. A correlation of 0.71 between rate of external evaluations developed by competitors and self- evaluations developed by managers for sampled practices increases our conﬁdence in the data. ranging from the most We used two groups of items to measure the proactive- ness of the environmental strategy of each garage. The items were grouped based on theoretically well-differen- tiated categories innovative prevention practices to the simplest eco-efﬁcient practices. Although both groups of items include proactive practices, they are signiﬁcantly different in terms of their complexity and objectives, ranging from major changes in product and process design to saving energy and reducing waste. These have been analysed differently in extant literature (e.g. Hart, 1995; Marcus and Anderson, 2006). The ﬁrst group of practices was measured using 14 items drawn from Arago´ n-Correa’s (1998) measure for environ- mental strategies designed to cover the whole range of environmental practices that a ﬁrm might adopt including product and process innovations for pollution prevention. Table A1 in the Appendix shows the results of standardized varimax rotation of these items resulting in two signiﬁcant factors (eigenvalues41). Responses were on a ﬁve-point scale ranging from 1 for ‘‘we have not addressed this issue at all’’ to 5 for ‘‘we are the leaders on this practice in our sector’’. Unless otherwise noted, all subsequent scales were created by using the same ﬁve-point response format. The second group of practices included nine items to evaluate the importance that managers gave to their ﬁrm’s implementation of various eco-efﬁcient practices. These environmental practices have been suggested as the ﬁrst steps toward proactive environmental practices, and/or as speciﬁcally applicable to SMEs (e.g. Schmidheiny, 1992; Smith and Kemp, 1998). Exploratory principal compo- nents analysis with varimax rotation showed that these items formed two factors with eigenvalues41 (Please refer to Table A2 in the Appendix). 4.2.2. Stakeholder management Following previous environmental research (Buysse and Verbeke, 2003; Cordano and Frieze, 2000; Flannery and May, 2000), we used Ajzen and Fishbein’s (1980) technique as a guide to measure the capability of stakeholder management. First, we listed nine categories of stake- holders (such as local communities, shareholders, the media, environmentalists, and customers), and asked the general managers to rate (from 1 to 5) the level of attention they paid to each category in managing their enterprises. Second, we asked the informants to evaluate (from 1 to 5) their perception of the importance of each stakeholder for the environmental performance of the ﬁrm. Similar to Buysse and Verbeke’s (2003) methodology, we weighted the managers’ attention to each stakeholder by the perceived attention of each stakeholder to environmental impacts of the ﬁrm. The scores ranged from 1 to 25, with a higher score indicating a higher capability of stakeholder management. Exploratory principal components analysis with varimax rotation of those nine items showed that they formed three factors with eigenvalues41 (Please refer to Table A3 in the Appendix). ARTICLE IN PRESS J.A. Arago´n-Correa et al. / Journal of Environmental Management 86 (2008) 88–103 95 4.2.3. Shared vision We used three items (shown in the Appendix) based on previous literature on shared ideas about organizational objectives and the ways in which employees inﬂuence those objectives (e.g. Jehn, 1995; Oswald et al., 1994). Each item was measured on a ﬁve-point Likert response scale (1¼‘‘strongly disagree’’, 5¼‘‘strongly agree’’). Exploratory principal components analysis with varimax rotation of those three items showed that they formed only one factor with eigenvalue41 (Cronbach’s alpha ¼ 0:791). A high average score was indicative of a high degree of shared vision in a garage. 4.2.4. Strategic proactivity We used three bipolar items from Arago´ n-Correa’s (1998) validated scale measuring proactivity in a ﬁrm’s generic business strategy (refer to the Appendix). The scale draws on Miles and Snow’s (1978) well-known typology. We asked each respondent to position his or her ﬁrm on a scale of 1–5 that was constructed so that high values matched a ‘‘prospector’’ strategy and low values, a ‘‘defender’’ strategy. We inverted this pattern for the second question to avoid skewing the answers. Exploratory principal components analysis with varimax rotation of those three items showed that they formed only one factor with eigenvalue41 (alpha ¼ 0:770). A high score was indicative of high development of strategic proactivity in a garage. 4.2.5. Firm performance Strategy and environment scholars have used subjective perceptions of managers (e.g. Judge and Douglas, 1998; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998) and objective data (e.g. Russo and Fouts, 1997) to measure ﬁrm performance. We included questions tapping both types of assessment in our interviews, but the garage managers were more open to offering their perceptions rather than to offering precise quantitative data (only 61 offered quantitative data). Therefore, we tested the model using a perceptual measure of ﬁnancial performance in which each respondent rated his or her organization’s performance relative to that of other ﬁrms in the garage industry using two items (see Appendix). These two items were drawn from Judge and Douglas (1998). These authors provide an extensive discussion and details about the potential of this process of measurement and similar processes in previous strategic literature (e.g. Miller and Friesen, 1984; Powell, 1995). The ﬁnal measure was an average of two items (alpha ¼ 0:69), and a high score was indicative of a high level of performance in the garage as compared to the garage calculated the correlation between the objective and subjective data. These were high and statistically signiﬁcant (0.62, po0:01). industry. Where possible, we the 4.2.6. Control variables All our sampled ﬁrms were SMEs according to institu- tional deﬁnitions. However, the breadth of this category suggested the need to use organization size to control for potential differences. The size indicators initially used were annual turnover and number of employees. Both indicators were highly and signiﬁcantly correlated in this sample and we chose to use the number of employees. The logarithm of an organization’s number of employees was used to measure size. We also added a dummy variable to control potential external inﬂuences based on whether or not the garage was associated with an automotive dealer or was independent. 5. Analysis and results 5.1. Analysis In a preliminary analysis, the two variables measuring proactive environmental practices were ﬁrst subjected to a cluster analysis using a non-hierarchical optimising proce- dure to determine whether different groups of similar ﬁrms could be grouped on the basis of their environmental strategies (Hair et al., 1998). Buysse and Verbeke’s (2003) classiﬁcation of environ- mental strategies suggested a three-cluster solution which showed in our data a relatively small group of ﬁrms (n ¼ 26) characterized by high levels of innovative and preventive environmental practices and of eco-efﬁcient practices. A second group (n ¼ 45) showed a high level of eco-efﬁcient practices and an intermediate level of innova- tive and preventive practices. Finally, a group of ﬁrms (n ¼ 37) exhibited the lowest levels of both eco-efﬁcient and innovative practices. We identiﬁed these groups as exhibiting ‘‘leadership,’’ ‘‘pollution prevention,’’ and ‘‘re- active’’ environmental strategies, respectively, based on Buysse and Verbeke’s (2003) terminology. The ﬁrst group exhibits the greatest proactiveness, the second group exhibits some proactive practices focusing on simpler eco- efﬁciency solutions, and the third group does not exhibit any proactive practices. A four-cluster solution would divide the last group into two but not provide additional information. Although the cluster analysis was developed using standardized values as recommended to avoid any inﬂu- ences of scales, Table 1 shows average scores using raw values for the different variables in each emerging group to avoid problems in interpreting standardized values. The ‘‘leadership’’ group have the highest values for all the analysed variables, the ‘‘pollution prevention’’ group shows intermediate values, and the ‘reactor’ group has the lowest values for the organizational capabilities and environmental performance. Test statistics from one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA Fs) were all signiﬁcant except for shared vision, showing the robustness of the solution (Hair et al., 1998). Cluster analyses were repeated on randomly selected sub-samples, indicating that the results can be considered independent of sample character- istics (Henriques and Sadorsky, 1999). 96 J.A.

Hypothesized model. The results show that the patterns of environmental strategies for the sampled SMEs are congruent with theoretical typologies ranging from reactive (‘‘reactor’’) to the most proactive strategies (‘‘pollution prevention’’ and ‘‘leader’’). Our classiﬁcation is also consistent with previous classiﬁcations for large ﬁrms (e.g. Buysse and Verbeke, 2003). The values in Table 1 for the rest of the variables suggest support for Hypotheses 1–4. Next, we used a structural equation model for a deﬁnitive test of our hypotheses (Fig. 1). 5.2. Results We examined our hypotheses using structural equation modelling (LISREL 8.3) with the covariance matrix as input and the assumption of no error. This provided a conservative test of the model (Hair et al., 1998) and was estimated using the weighted least squares (WLS)4 method. We used a recursive non-saturated model, taking shared vision (x1), stakeholder management (x2), strategic proac- tivity (x3), size (x4), and dealer afﬁliation (x5) as the 4The sample sized was 108. Sample size, as in any other statistical method, provides a basis for the estimation of sampling erroryy. While there is no correct sample size, recommendations are for a size ranging between 100 to 200 (Hair et al., 1998, p. 637). exogenous latent variables. Size and dealer afﬁliation were control variables, innovative preventive practices (Z1) and eco-efﬁcient practices (Z2) were the ﬁrst-grade endogenous latent variables, and performance (Z3) was the second- grade endogenous latent variable. Such analysis allows for modelling based on both latent variables and manifest variables, a property well suited for the hypothesized model where most of the represented constructs are abstractions of unobservable phenomena. Fig. 1 shows our proposed model and the hypotheses. Table 2 presents the means, standard deviations, reliability coefﬁcients, and correlations among the variables. Prior to conducting our analyses, we followed the procedure outlined by Bono and Judge (2003) for examining the measurement properties of our three multidimensional variables to prevent interpretational problems inherent in simultaneous estimation of measurement and structural models. for As suggested in extant literature (e.g. Cordano and Frieze, 2000; Flannery and May, 2000), the dimensions of stakeholder management emerging from the exploratory factorial analysis were highly interrelated in our data. A second-order conﬁrmatory factor analysis (loading items on the three dimensions on a single transformational factor) demonstrated a reasonable ﬁt the data (w2 ¼ 18:95; df ¼ 20; RMSEA ¼ 0:001; CFI ¼ 0:99; IFI ¼ 0:99) with standardized loadings ranging from 0.97 to 0.40 (Fig. 2). Whereas this model is not a perfect ﬁt for the data, because of cross-loading among some of the items, alternative models were unambiguously rejected. For instance, our model is a better ﬁt than a single-factor model in which items are loaded directly on the ﬁnal factor (w2 ¼ 137:56; df ¼ 27; RMSEA ¼ 0:195; CFI ¼ 0:74; IFI ¼ 0:74). Hence, the three factors were considered indicators of a single measure, which we labelled ‘‘stake- holder management.’’ Subsequent analyses were conducted using a single factor for stakeholder management. The ﬁnal measure was a weighted average of the three factors using the standardized loadings obtained from the second-order factor analysis, and a high score was indicative of a high capability for stakeholder management. ARTICLE IN PRESS J.A.

Whereas these models were not a perfect ﬁt for the data, because of cross-loading among some of the items, alternative models were unambiguously rejected. For instance, these models were a better ﬁt than a single-factor model, in which items are loaded directly on the ﬁnal factor of the innovative-preventive practices (w2 ¼ 39:10; df ¼ 20; RMSEA ¼ 0:094; CFI ¼ 0:89; IFI ¼ 0:90) or eco-efﬁcient practices (w2 ¼ 33:40; df ¼ 14; RMSEA ¼ 0:113; CFI ¼ 0:87; IFI ¼ 0:87). Hence, the two factors were considered indicators of a single measure, which we labelled ‘‘in- novative-preventive practices’’ and ‘‘eco-efﬁcient prac- tices.’’ The ﬁnal measures were weighted averages of the two factors using the standardized loadings obtained from the second-order factor analysis, and high scores were indicative of high degrees of innovative-preventive prac- tices and eco-efﬁcient practices, respectively, in a garage’s environmental strategy. Final results of this model, which are displayed in Fig. 2, revealed that each ﬁnal item signiﬁcantly loads on its respective construct showing high convergent validity of the measurement scale for each construct. The hypothesized model provided an acceptable ﬁt to the data (w2 ¼ 86:25; df ¼ 60; RMSEA ¼ 0:08; AGFI ¼ 0:89; NNFI ¼ 0:89; CFI ¼ 0:92; IFI ¼ 0:91). All of the mod- iﬁcation indices for the beta pathways between major variables were small, suggesting that adding additional paths would not signiﬁcantly improve the ﬁt. The statistically signiﬁcant parameters (see Fig. 2) predicting that the capability of shared vision would have a positive inﬂuence on the development of proactive environmental strategies by inﬂuencing the innovative-preventive and the eco-efﬁcient practices (g11 ¼ 0:38 and g21 ¼ 0:61, respec- tively; po0:001) support Hypothesis 1. A positive and statistically signiﬁcant parameter estimate for the path between stakeholder management capability and innova- tive-preventive practices (g12 ¼ 0:88, po0:001), and eco- efﬁciency (g22 ¼ 0:23, po0:05) provides support for Hy- pothesis 2. Hypothesis 3, regarding the inﬂuence of a strategic proactivity capability on environmental proac- tiveness, was also supported by the parameter estimates (g13 ¼ 0:31 and g23 ¼ 0:24, respectively; po0:05). Finally, Hypothesis 4, regarding the relationship between a proactive environmental strategy and ﬁrm performance, was supported by positive and signiﬁcant parameter estimates the path between innovative-preventive strategies and performance (b31 ¼ 0:31, po0:01) and for the path between eco-efﬁciency and performance (b32 ¼ 0:42, po0:01). for The inﬂuence of control variables was tested for each of the three dependent variables in our model. The control variable for size showed a positive and statistically signiﬁcant (po0:01) association with innovative-preventive practices. The inﬂuence of size on eco-efﬁcient practices and performance was not signiﬁcant for the sampled ﬁrms. The analysis of the inﬂuence of dealer afﬁliation was not signiﬁcant for our sample. We also ﬁt several nested models to the data, each one incorporating different assumptions about parameters (Bollen and Long, 1993). These alter- native models indicated that our proposed model was parsimonious and a good ﬁt. Detailed information about alternative models is available upon request. 6. Discussion, conclusions, and future research Our contribution is to show, contrary to conventional wisdom in the extant literature, that even SMEs can adopt proactive environmental practices and that these practices can lead to superior ﬁnancial performance via speciﬁc capabilities based on the unique strategic characteristics of SMEs. Moreover, our research also contributes to the resource-based view by showing that this perspective is relevant for SMEs’ competitive strategies generally. As we had expected, SMEs’ potential to adopt proactive environmental practices is associated with speciﬁc organi- zational capabilities based on their unique strategic characteristics of shorter lines of communication and closer interaction, the presence of a founder’s vision, ﬂexibility in managing external relationships, and an entrepreneurial orientation. These capabilities were shared vision, stakeholder management, and strategic proactivity. Our data clearly clustered SMEs’ environmental strate- gies into reactive, pollution prevention, and leadership categories, similar to ﬁndings for large ﬁrms (Buysse and Verbeke, 2003) and ﬁrms with proactive environmental strategies showed a positive and signiﬁcant relationship with performance for our sampled ﬁrms, similar to the ﬁndings for larger ﬁrms (Arago´ n-Correa, 1998; Judge and Douglas, 1998; Russo and Fouts, 1997). The simultaneous inﬂuence of ﬁrm size and organiza- tional capabilities on innovative-preventive environmental practices suggests that size, a common proxy for organiza- tional resources, is a relevant but not a deterministic condition for developing the most proactive environmental strategies. Therefore, our ﬁndings contradict the traditional assumption that SMEs cannot develop proactive environ- mental strategies owing to scarcity of slack resources. Our results support the natural resource-based view perspective (Hart, 1995) that indicates that organizational capabilities are critical for strategies of both large ﬁrms and SMEs. Furthermore, our results have shown that the capabil- ities promoting the development of environmentally proactive approaches in the sampled SMEs coincide with those found for large companies in previous research (e.g. Marcus and Geffen, 1998; Ramus and Steger, 2000; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). Although researchers concerned with organizational size have stated that what applies to large ﬁrms may not apply to small ones, recent studies (e.g. Flannery and May, 2000) and our own results show similar relationships for large and small ﬁrms. ARTICLE IN PRESS J.A. Arago´n-Correa et al. / Journal of Environmental Management 86 (2008) 88–103 99 Traditional arguments in the small ﬁrm context may have to be restated from the perspective of the resource-based view, that is, large and small ﬁrms both require organiza- tional capabilities for competitive strategies. However, large and small ﬁrms may follow different paths and generate different sets of capabilities based on different sets of characteristics. Therefore, although some features of these three capabilities for SMEs may be similar to those in large organizations, the foundations for those capabilities may be signiﬁcantly different for big and small-size organizations. While larger ﬁrms may deploy resources such as sophisticated systems for knowledge management, public relations campaigns, or signiﬁcant investments in R&D to develop these three capabilities, small organiza- tions may build these capabilities based on their unique strategic characteristics discussed above. We also showed a positive and signiﬁcant relationship between innovative-preventive environmental practices and eco-efﬁcient practices and ﬁrm performance for the sampled SMEs. The positive relationship between the most proactive environmental practices and ﬁrm performance is also consistent with those obtained for larger ﬁrms (e.g. Judge and Douglas, 1998; Russo and Fouts, 1997), and it shows that a proactiveness in environmental strategy may be an appropriate alternative for both small and large ﬁrms. It is especially interesting that our results show, in a SME context, a positive and signiﬁcant relationship between ﬁrm performance and eco-efﬁcient practices analysed as a systematic pattern of simple but multiple, consistent and co-ordinated practices that simultaneously reduce environmental impacts and organizational costs. This is relevant for practitioners and policy makers because eco-efﬁcient practices have been often suggested as ﬁrst steps for adoption by small ﬁrms and others starting on the path of environmental change. Viewed from a resource- based perspective, this result may help to differentiate between an isolated practice (e.g. switching off lights when not necessary) and a systematic pattern of practices demanding certain organizational capabilities (rather than resources or critical size). Partial analysis of our data indicates that certain eco-efﬁcient practices might indirectly prevent the generation of organizational capabilities that Appendix A are positively related to ﬁrm performance if implemented in an isolated way by deterring innovation. to the development of The main limitation of our study arises from our modelling of environmental strategy as exclusively a function of internal capabilities. External conditions are also relevant environmental initiatives (Arago´ n-Correa and Sharma, 2003; Clemens, 2001; Newton and Harte, 1997). Future research needs to complement the internal inﬂuences with the role of social and normative paradigms in the SMEs’ environmental behaviour. We attempt in our study to minimize external inﬂuences via homogeneity of the context of the sampled organizations. Finally, we caution that our results do not allow deﬁnitive statement about the causality in the analysed relationships and may have limited generalizability due to the business and geographi- cal peculiarities of our sample. the direction of Overall, our study conﬁrms that SMEs have an important role to play in reducing the negative impacts of business on the natural environment. Considering the absolute impact of the SME sector on global economies, more research attention should be paid to the environ- mental practices of SMEs. Although previous research has shown that larger ﬁrms are often environmentally more proactive than smaller ones, paradoxically many of the capabilities needed to develop proactive environmental approaches may be fostered by certain strategic character- istics of small ﬁrms. Future longitudinal work could conﬁrm the direction of causality between capabilities, environmental performance, and ﬁnancial performance. Research comparing large and small ﬁrms can show that SMEs may be at a resource disadvantage but not a capability disadvantage when it comes to environmental advances and this would have important implications for policy makers and practitioners.
