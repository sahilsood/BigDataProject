More speciﬁcally, this research explores the effect of GSCM efforts and other organizational factors on ﬁrm performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that serve as suppliers to large customer ﬁrms in the electronics industry. Design/methodology/approach – This study developed a research model relating GSCM practice and business performance through three organizational variables (employee satisfaction, operational efﬁciency, and relational efﬁciency) as moderators. Statistical analyses were based on the data collected, through survey questionnaires, from 223 SMEs in the electronics industry in Korea. Reliability, validity, and goodness-of-ﬁt of the research model were tested by the widely accepted statistical tools. To test the hypotheses relating GSCM practice implementation and business performance, structural equation modeling was used. Findings – The most anticipated ﬁnding of the study was a direct link between GSCM practice implementation and business performance. However, no statistical signiﬁcance was found. Instead, signiﬁcant indirect relationships were found between GSCM practice implementation and business performance through mediating variables of operational efﬁciency and relational efﬁciency. This result indicates that business performance will be improved when GSCM enhances operational efﬁciency and operational efﬁciency. Research limitations/implications – Research on GSCM is still at the early stage. Further reﬁnement of the questionnaire is needed. Generalizability of the ﬁndings is also limited because of data collected from electronics ﬁrms in Korean. This study shed several important insights. The ﬁndings of this study are generally consistent with prior studies in other parts of the world. SMEs in the Korean electronics industry believe that GSCM practices help generate new opportunities to attract clients in addition to complying with the buyer ﬁrms’ demand. It was also found that implementation of GSCM practices help improve operational and relational efﬁciencies of supplier ﬁrms. Originality/value – Few empirical studies have been done in GSCM based on the conceptual footing of resource dependence theory. Also, this study was conducted from the supplier’s perspective in examining the weaknesses of SME suppliers. Thus, the authors emphasize the importance of support from large buying ﬁrms for improving SME suppliers’ green management capabilities.
