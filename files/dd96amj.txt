MODES OF THEORIZING IN STRATEGIC  HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT:  TESTS OF UNIVERSALISTIC, CONTINGENCY,  AND CONFIGURATIONAL  PERFORMANCE PREDICTIONS  JOHN E. DELERY  University of Arkansas  D. HAROLD DOTY  Syracuse University  The field of strategic human resource management (SHRM) has been  criticized for lacking a solid theoretical foundation. This article docu-  ments that, contrary to this criticism, the SHRM literature draws on  three dominant modes of theorizing: universalistic, contingency, and  configurational perspectives. Seven key strategic human resource prac-  tices are identified and used to develop theoretical arguments consistent  with each perspective. The results demonstrate that each perspective  can be used to structure theoretical arguments that explain significant  levels of variation in financial performance.  During the last decade there has been a dramatic shift in the field of  human resource (HR) management. This shift has broadened the focus of HR  research from the micro analytic research that dominated the field in the  past to a more macro or strategic perspective. The strategic perspective of  HR, which has been labeled strategic human resource management (SHRM),  has grown out of researchers' desire to demonstrate the importance of human  resource practices for organizational performance.  The basic premise underlying SHRM is that organizations adopting a  particular strategy require HR practices that are different from those required  by organizations adopting alternative strategies (Dyer 1984a, 1984b; Fom-  brum, Tichy, & Devanna 1984; Jackson & Schuler, 1995; Jackson, Schuler, &  Rivero, 1989; Schuler & Jackson, 1987a, 1987b, 1988; Schuier & MacMillan,  We would like to thank Patrick M. Wright, Susan L. Shackelford, Daniel C. Ganster, and  Nina Gupta for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this article. The first author would  also like to thank Lyle F. Schoenfeldt for his direction and guidance of the dissertation on  which this study is based.  This study was partially funded by grants from the Center for Human Resource Management,  the College of Business Administration, and the Office of Graduate Studies, all of Texas A&M  University.  802 This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1996  Delery and Doty  803  1984). If this fundamental assumption is correct, then much of the variation in  HR practices across organizations should be explained by the organizations'  strategies, and organizations that have greater congruence between their HR  practices and their strategies should enjoy superior performance. There is  some support for this assumption. For example, Schuler and Jackson (1988)  and Arthur (1992) demonstrated that organizations following different strate-  gies utilize different HR practices. Other researchers have demonstrated that  HR practices can influence organizationally relevant outcomes such as pro-  ductivity and profitability (Arthur, 1994; Gerhart & Milkovich, 1990; Huselid,  1993, 1995; Terpstra & Rozell, 1993).  Despite the growing body of empirical SHRM research, the field has  been criticized for lacking a solid theoretical foundation (Bacharach, 1989;  Dyer, 1985). This criticism arises, in part, because three different modes of  theorizing have been employed in the field, but the differences among the  alternative perspectives have not been explicitly acknowledged. Some au-  thors have adopted a universalistic perspective (cf. Dewar & Werbel, 1979)  and argued for a "best practices" approach to SHRM (Delaney, Lewin, &  Ichniowski, 1989; Huselid, 1993, 1995; Osterman, 1994; Pfeffer, 1994; Terp-  stra & Rozell, 1993). These researchers, like many micro-level HR researchers,  posit that some HR practices are always better than others and that all  organizations should adopt these best practices. For instance, Pfeffer argued  that greater use of 16 management practices, such as participation and em-  powerment, incentive pay, employment security, promotion from within,  and training and skill development, results in higher productivity and profit  across organizations. Similarly, Osterman (1994) argued that a number of  innovative work practices, such as teams, job rotation, quality circles, and  total quality management, result in productivity gains for all American orga-  nizations. In general, the practices identified by Pfeffer and Osterman have  been labeled "high performance work practices," or simply "best practices."  A second group of researchers has adopted a contingency perspective  (Butler, Ferris, & Napier, 1991; Dyer, 1985; Fombrum et al., 1984; Golden &  Ramanujam, 1985; Gomez-Mejia & Balkin, 1992; Lengnick-Hall & Lengnick-  Hall, 1988; Milkovich, 1988; Schuler & Jackson, 1987a). Contingency theo-  rists argue that, in order to be effective, an organization's HR policies must be  consistent with other aspects of the organization. For example, contingency  theorists have attempted to show how a number of HR practices are consistent  with different strategic positions and how these practices relate to firm perfor-  mance (Balkin & Gomez-Mejia, 1987; Begin, 1993; Gomez-Mejia & Balkin,  1992; Schuler & Jackson, 1987a).  A third group of SHRM theorists has developed arguments that are  consistent with the configurational approach that is emerging in the organiza-  tion theory and strategic management literatures. Configurational theories  differ from universalistic and traditional contingency theories because con-  figurational theories are guided by the holistic principle of inquiry, are usu-  ally based on typologies of ideal types, and explicitly adopt the systems  assumption of "equifinality" (Doty, Glick, & Huber, 1993; Doty & Glick, This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  804  Academy of Management Journal  August  1994; Meyer, Tsui, & Hinings, 1993; Miller & Friesen, 1984; Venkatraman &  Prescott, 1990). In general, configurational theories are concerned with how  the pattern of multiple independent variables is related to a dependent vari-  able rather than with how individual independent variables are related to  the dependent variable. Wright and McMahan appeared to suggest that the  configurational perspective was an appropriate approach for SHRM when  they argued that SHRM is concerned with "the pattern of planned human  resource deployments and activities intended to enable an organization to  achieve its goals" (1992: 298, emphasis added) and that, in order to be  effective, an organization must develop an HR system that achieves both  horizontal and vertical fit. Horizontal fit refers to the internal consistency  of the organization's HR policies or practices, and vertical fit refers to the  congruence of the HR system with other organizational characteristics, such  as firm strategy. An ideal configuration would be one with the highest degree  of horizontal fit.  Configurational notions are currently incorporated in both theoretical  and empirical SHRM studies. Numerous authors have attempted to develop  a priori typologies of effective HR systems and link the performance of  HR systems to firm strategy. For example, Miles and Snow (1984) and Arthur  (1992) developed multiple equally effective combinations of HR practices  and argued that the different sets of practices are suited for different firm  strategies. Configurational ideas are incorporated in empirical SHRM studies  when researchers attempt to identify configurations of HR practices that  predict superior performance when used in association with each other, or  the correct strategy, or both. For example, Arthur (1992) argued that there  are two prototypical employment systems, or groups of HR practices. Al-  though he did not specifically state the idea, Arthur (1992) appeared to  argue that the closer an organization's HR practices resemble the correct  prototypical system (for its business strategy), the greater the performance  gains. Similarly, MacDuffie (1995) derived specific configurations, or "bun-  dles," of HR practices that enhance firm performance. Finally, Ichniowski,  Shaw, and Prennushi attempted to test the hypothesis that "combinations  of HRM practices have bigger effects on productivity than the sum of the  component effects due to individual practices" (1994: 9, emphasis deleted).  This is clearly an argument in support of a configurational perspective.  This article advances the SHRM literature by clearly articulating the  important differences among the universalistic, contingency, and configura-  tional perspectives that are used in the literature and then empirically testing  hypotheses that are consistent with the logic of each of the three perspectives.  Seven important HR practices that are common to much of the theoretical  work in SHRM are identified. The individual practices are used to formulate  a series of universalistic and contingency arguments that are parallel to  different arguments found in the SHRM literature. Configurational arguments  are then formulated by organizing the individual HR practices into two ideal-  type employment systems that are posited to enhance firm performance. The  employment systems form the basis of a series of configurational predictions.

THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES OF STRATEGIC HUMAN  RESOURCE MANAGEMENT  To date, SHRM has predominately been an applied field. The field's  dominant focus has been to demonstrate the importance of effectively manag-  ing the human resources of organizations. Thus, a growing number of articles  are appearing in the publications aimed at the practitioner community. Al-  though this applied focus has helped to highlight the contributions of SHRM  to organizations, it has not fostered sound theoretical development. What  has emerged is a growing literature discussing the benefits of SHRM without  sufficient articulation of the specific theoretical underpinnings of the field.  Presented below are more complete articulations of the three major modes  of theorizing imbedded in the field: the universalistic, contingency, and  configurational perspectives.  Universalistic Perspective  Universalistic arguments are the simplest form of theoretical statement  in the SHRM literature because they imply that the relationship between a  given independent variable and a dependent variable is universal across the  population of organizations. Developing universalistic predictions requires  two steps. First, important strategic HR practices must be identified. Second,  arguments that relate the individual practices to organizational performance  must be presented.  Strategic HR practices. Strategic HR practices are those that are theoreti-  cally or empirically related to overall organization performance. Although  not all HR practices are strategic, there is growing consensus about which  practices can be considered strategic. Drawing on the theoretical works of  Osterman (1987), Sonnenfeld and Peiperl (1988), Kerr and Slocum (1987),  and Miles and Snow (1984), we identified seven practices that are consis-  tently considered strategic HR practices. These are: internal career opportuni-  ties, formal training systems, appraisal measures, profit sharing, employment  security, voice mechanisms, and job definition. Nearly all of these are also  among Pfeffer's (1994) 16 most effective practices for managing people.  The first practice, internal career opportunities, refers to the use of inter-  nal labor markets. In other words, organizations can choose to hire predomi-  nantly from within or from outside. The second practice, training systems,  refers to the amount of formal training given to employees. Organizations  can provide extensive formal training or rely on acquiring skills through  selection and some socialization. Third, appraisals can be based on results  or behavior. Behavior-based appraisals focus on the behaviors of individuals  necessary to perform the job effectively, whereas results-oriented appraisals  focus merely on the consequences of those behaviors. Fourth, profit-sharing  plans, which tie pay to organizational performance, have been seen as an This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  806  Academy of Management Journal  August  integral part of a strategic HR system. Fifth, the degree to which employees  are given employment security has many strategic implications. Although it  is apparent in today's economy that even the most senior employees are not  free from layoffs, there are particular groups of employees in organizations  who undoubtedly have a greater sense of security in their jobs than other  employees, either because of a formal or an informal policy of employment  security. Sixth, voice mechanisms, both formal grievance systems and partici-  pation in decision making, have emerged as key factors. Finally, the degree  to which jobs are tightly or narrowly defined is important. Tightly defined  jobs are those in which the employees know the content of their jobs exactly.  The job is limited in scope, and incumbents do not perform duties that are  not considered part of the job. The job duties are more likely shaped by a  well-defined job description than by individual action.  We view these seven practices as critical characteristics of employment  systems in organizations and will use these practices individually and in  combinations as the basis for hypotheses that are consistent with the alterna-  tive theoretical perspectives investigated here. There are other HR practices  that might affect organizational performance. For example, Schuler and Jack-  son (1987a) presented a very comprehensive list of HR practices. However,  the seven practices listed above appeared to have the greatest support across  a diverse literature. Thus, in the interest of parsimony, we restricted our  arguments and analyses to these seven practices.  Universalistic predictions. Theorists adopting a universalistic perspec-  tive posit that greater use of specific employment practices will always result  in better (or worse) organizational performance. Many universalistic argu-  ments seem reasonable. For example, conducting more valid performance  appraisals or using more valid selection devices should always be better  than using less valid measures.  Many researchers have supported universalistic predictions. Leonard  (1990) found that organizations having long-term incentive plans for their  executives had larger increases in return on equity over a four-year period  than did other organizations. Abowd (1990) found that the degree to which  managerial compensation was based on an organization's financial perfor-  mance was significantly related to future financial performance. Gerhart and  Milkovich (1990) found that pay mix was related to financial performance.  Organizations with pay plans that included a greater amount of performance-  contingent pay achieved superior financial performance. In combination,  these studies indicate that organizations with stronger pay-for-performance  norms achieved better long-term financial performance than did organiza-  tions with weaker pay-for-performance norms. Terpstra and Rozell (1993)  posited five "best" staffing practices and found that the use of these practices  had a moderate, positive relationship with organizational performance. Fi-  nally, Huselid (1993, 1995) identified a link between organization-level out-  comes and groups of high performance work practices. Instead of focusing  on a single practice (e.g., staffing), Huselid assessed the simultaneous use of  multiple sophisticated HR practices and concluded that the HR sophistica- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1996  Delery and Doty  807  tion of an organization was significantly related to turnover, organizational  productivity, and financial performance. Overall, the level of support gener-  ated for universalistic predictions indicates that the universalistic perspec-  tive is a valid theoretical perspective for SHRM theorists.  The current study draws on research on HR system sophistication and  high performance work practices to predict positive relationships between  each of the seven strategic HR practices and organizational performance.  Thus, we hypothesize  Hypothesis 1: There will be a positive relationship between  financial performance and (a) the use of internal career  ladders, (b) formal training systems, (c) results-oriented  appraisal, (d) performance-based compensation, (e) em-  ployment security, (f) employee voice, and (g) broadly de-  fined jobs.  Contingency Perspective  Contingency arguments are more complex than universalistic arguments  because contingency arguments imply interactions rather than the simple  linear relationships incorporated in universalistic theories (Schoonhoven,  1981; Van de Ven & Drazin, 1985; Venkatraman, 1989). In other words,  contingency theories posit that the relationship between the relevant inde-  pendent variable and the dependent variable will be different for different  levels of the critical contingency variable. The organization's strategy is  considered to be the primary contingency factor in the SHRM literature.  Thus, a contingency perspective requires a researcher to select a theory of  firm strategy and then specify how the individual HR practices will interact  with firm strategy to result in organizational performance.  A strategic contingency. We selected Miles and Snow's (1978) theory  of strategy, structure, and process for the current study because this theory  has several advantages. First, it has been shown to be a relatively powerful  predictor of organizational effectiveness (Doty et al., 1993). Second, Miles  and Snow (1984) explicitly stated that the theory had implications for an  organization's HR policies. Third, the theory has commonly been used in  the SHRM literature. Finally, existing studies present alternative interpreta-  tions of Miles and Snow's theory that allow it to be interpreted both as a  contingency theory (Golden, 1992; Hambrick, 1983; Zajac & Shortell, 1989)  and as a configurational theory (Doty et al., 1993; Segev, 1989). Thus, Miles  and Snow's theory can be used with both the contingency perspective and  the configurational perspective presented in this article.  Interpreting Miles and Snow's (1978) theory as a contingency theory  requires a researcher to identify a single variable that differentiates the alter-  native strategies specified in the original theory. Most previous work has  used rate of product, service, or market innovation as the central contingency  variable (e.g., Hambrick, 1983; Zajac & Shortell, 1989). Firms that are highly  innovative are considered prospectors, firms that are moderately innovative  are considered analyzers, and firms that rarely innovate are considered de- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  808  Academy of Management Journal  August  fenders. Thus, the strategic positioning of all firms can be characterized by  a single contingency variable: innovation.  Contingency predictions. In contingency predictions, the relationship  between the use of specific employment practices and organizational perfor-  mance is posited to be contingent on an organization's strategy. The behav-  ioral perspective (Jackson et al., 1989) implies that successful implementation  of business strategy relies heavily on employee behavior. An organization's  strategy necessitates behavioral requirements for success, and the use of HR  practices in the organization can reward and control employee behavior.  Therefore, the organization should implement HR practices that encourage  the employee behaviors that are consistent with the organization's strategy.  This alignment of strategy and HR practices allows organizations to achieve  superior performance.  Agency theory (Eisenhardt, 1988; Fama, 1980; Fama & Jensen, 1983)  leads to similar predictions. If an employer knows what employee behaviors  it needs, then the organization will enact policies and procedures that elicit  these behaviors. In agency theory terms, the organization would simply be  aligning the interests of the employer (principal) and the employee (agent).  Organizations that do a better job of aligning these interests will achieve  greater performance.  There are many ways that HR practices can be used to elicit from employ-  ees behaviors that are consistent with an organization's strategy. Since behav-  ior is a function of ability and motivation, an organization can set up HR  practices that ensure that individuals with the required abilities are hired  and retained and can also use HR practices to ensure that employees are  motivated to behave in ways consistent with the business strategy. Kerr  and Jackofsky (1989) used the organizational growth strategies described by  Leontiades (1980) to illustrate that, given a specific strategy, it is more useful  to rely on employee selection than on employee development. They argued  that "effectiveness will be greater for steady-state firms utilizing development  to align managers with strategies" (1989: 165). Thus,  Hypothesis 2: The relationship between human resource  practices and financial performance will be contingent on  an organization's strategy.  Configurational Perspective  Configurational arguments are more complex than those of either of the  previous two theoretical perspectives for several reasons. First, configura-  tional theories draw on the holistic principle of inquiry (Doty et al., 1993;  McKelvey, 1982; Meyer et al., 1993; Miller & Friesen, 1984; Venkatraman &  Prescott, 1990) to identify configurations, or unique patterns of factors, that  are posited to be maximally effective. These configurations represent nonlin-  ear synergistic effects and higher-order interactions that cannot be repre-  sented with traditional bivariate contingency theories (Doty & Glick, 1994).  Second, configurational theories incorporate the assumption of equifinality  by positing that multiple unique configurations of the relevant factors can This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1996  Delery and Doty  809  result in maximal performance (Doty & Glick, 1994; Meyer et al., 1993).  Third, these configurations are assumed to be ideal types that are theoretical  constructs rather than empirically observable phenomena (Blalock, 1969;  Doty & Glick, 1994; Meyer et al., 1993; McKinney, 1966; Weber, 1904). As a  consequence of these differences, configurational theorists working in SHRM  must theoretically derive internally consistent configurations of HR practices,  or employment systems, that maximize horizontal fit, and then link these  employment systems to alternative strategic configurations to maximize verti-  cal fit.  Employment systems. A handful of SHRM researchers have developed  theoretically derived employment systems (e.g., Kerr & Slocum, 1987; Oster-  man, 1987; Sonnenfeld & Peiperl, 1988). Drawing on the works of these  previous theorists, we propose the following two employment systems: the  market-type system and the internal system. These two systems, each of  which can be described in terms of the seven employment practices discussed  earlier, are summarized in Table 1.  TABLE 1  Characteristics of Employment Systems  Market-Type System  Internal System  Hiring almost exclusively  from outside the  organization  Very little use of internal  career ladders  Hiring mainly from within the  organization  Extensive use of well-defined  career ladders  No formal training provided  Little if any socialization  taking place within the  organization  Performance measured by  quantifiable output or  results-oriented measures  Feedback in the form of  numbers and evaluative  Extensive formal training  provided  Great amount of socialization  within the organization  Performance measured by  behavior-oriented measures  Feedback more for  developmental purposes  Profit sharing used extensively  HR Practices  Internal career  opportunities  Training  Results-oriented  appraisals  Profit sharing  Employment security  Very little employment  security given  Participation  Employees given little voice  in the organization  Job descriptions  Jobs are not clearly defined  Job definitions are loose  Few incentive systems used  Very little use of profit sharing  Great deal of employment  security among those who  make it through the initial trial  period  Extensive benefits to those  "outplaced"  Formal dismissal policies  Employees likely have access to  grievance systems  Employees more likely to  participate in decision making  Jobs very tightly defined This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  810  Academy of Management Journal  August  The market-type system is characterized by hiring from outside an orga-  nization, providing little training, and evaluating performance through the  use of results measures. Employees who work under this system are compen-  sated or rewarded for individual performance as measured by the output  measures. They are given little employment security and voice, and their  jobs are usually broadly defined. This system is similar to the performance-  based system outlined by Kerr and Slocum (1987), the baseball teams of  Sonnenfeld and Peiperl (1988), and the type B system of Miles and Snow  (1984).  The internal system is characterized by the existence of an internal labor  market. Extensive socialization and training are common. Performance is  assessed through behavior, and appraisal feedback is given for developmental  purposes rather than evaluative purposes. A rather high degree of employ-  ment security is given. Employees are viewed as valuable sources of informa-  tion and are provided a great deal of voice. Individuals in these jobs often  have tightly defined job descriptions. This employment system is similar to  the hierarchy-based system of Kerr and Slocum (1987), the clubs of Sonnen-  feld and Peiperl (1988), and the type A system of Miles and Snow (1984).1  Strategic configurations. Miles and Snow's (1978) strategic typology can  be interpreted as a configurational theory that identifies three ideal strategic  types: the prospector, the analyzer, and the defender (Doty et al., 1993). The  defender has a narrow and stable product-market domain and seldom makes  major adjustments in its technology or structure. The emphasis is on better  and more efficient ways to produce a given product or service and on defend-  ing a market. A defender does little research and development. When defend-  ers pursue new products, they import the technology from outside the organi-  zation. Prospectors are characterized by their constant search for new  products and markets. They continually experiment with new product lines  and venture into new markets. These organizations are the creators of change  in their markets and are the forces to which competitors must respond. As  such, prospectors are more concerned with searching for new opportunities  and will likely not be as efficient as defenders. Analyzers have characteristics  of both defenders and prospectors. They usually operate in both stable prod-  uct domains, like defenders, and new changing product domains-like pros-  pectors. They are usually not the initiators of change, as are prospectors, but  they follow the changes much more rapidly than do defenders.  Alignment of employment systems and strategic configurations. The  strategic differences among the prospector, analyzer, and defender suggest  1 It should be noted that the internal system described here is similar to other systems  labeled broadly as internal labor markets. However, as a reviewer noted, this internal system  is different from the adversarial system that was found in many industrial settings, in that  employees are highly valued and are given the opportunity to participate in decisions. For  a more thorough discussion of the many forms of internal labor markets, see Pinfield and  Berner (1994).

Because defenders concentrate on efficiency  in current products and markets, effective employment practices should  emphasize a long-term commitment to an organization. The organization  should value employees with greater firm- and product-specific skills and  knowledge. The special skills and knowledge will be enhanced through  formal training, well-established career paths within the organization, and  performance appraisal and feedback systems that foster employee develop-  ment rather than short-term results. These practices should create an environ-  ment that fosters long-term commitment to the organization and reduces the  costs associated with replacement of workers and the knowledge, skills, and  abilities they possess. To further limit "voluntary dysfunctional turnover"  (Dalton & Todor, 1982), employees should be given a high amount of employ-  ment security and voice.  Prospectors, on the other hand, are constantly changing. They emphasize  exploration into products and markets in which they traditionally have had  little or no experience. Therefore, they are less aware of the specific behaviors  that are necessary to perform well in these areas. Consequently, they will  not be able to look inside their current organizations for the necessary skills  and will have to hire from the outside to acquire the talent that will keep  performance high. Because of the constant change in such an organization,  there will be little emphasis on long-term commitment to it. The organization  is constantly trying out new products and markets and will likely move on  quickly if it appears that there is little opportunity for profit in an area. Thus,  the organization will create a results-oriented appraisal system that measures  performance on bottom-line measures.  In sum, the HR practices consistent with the internal system are ap-  propriate for the defender strategy and include the use of (1) internal ca-  reer opportunities, (2) formal training systems, (3) behavior-based appraisal,  (4) hierarchy-based compensation (i.e., little profit sharing), (5) employment  security, (6) employee voice, and (7) tightly defined jobs. Conversely, the  prospector strategy requires the market system, which entails (1) few internal  career opportunities, (2) lack of formal training systems, (3) output-based  appraisal, (4) profit-sharing systems, (5) little employment security, (6) little  employee voice, and (7) broadly defined jobs.2  Configurational predictions. The configurational predictions are based  on the assumption that implementing the employment systems discussed  above will result in higher organizational performance. However, there are  2 The most parsimonious interpretation of Miles and Snow's (1978) theory implies that the  analyzer is at the midpoint between the prospector and defender (Doty et al., 1993). Thus, in  the configurational analysis reported later in the article, we included a third employment  subsystem suitable for the analyzer that is specified as the midpoint between the market-type  and internal employment subsystems. We will refer to this employment system as the middle-  of-the-road system.

The simplest configurational argument is based on the assumption that  the employment systems are ideal types that are equally effective under all  conditions (Doty & Glick, 1994). Given this interpretation, greater similarity  to any ideal-type employment system will increase organizational perfor-  mance. To be consistent with this interpretation, we predict that  Hypothesis 3: The greater the similarity to the ideal-type  employment system that is most similar to an organiza-  tion's employment system, the higher the financial perfor-  mance.  This first configurational assertion is different from traditional universal-  istic assertions in two ways. First, the configurational assertion relies on a  systems perspective and is based on the holistic pattern of HR practices,  whereas universalistic assertions are based on the individual HR practices.  Second, this configurational assertion includes the assumption of equifinality  and implies that multiple employment systems are equally effective for the  same set of conditions. Universalistic assertions, in contrast, posit that certain  individual HR practices are better in all conditions.  A somewhat more complex configurational interpretation incorporates  vertical fit by constraining an organization's choice of employment system  to be consistent with the organization's strategy. Thus, the organization must  adopt the one ideal type of employment system that is most consistent with  the organization's strategy. In other words, the organization must maximize  both horizontal and vertical fit. Consistent with this second configurational  interpretation, we hypothesize  Hypothesis 4: An employment system's similarity to the  one ideal-type employment system that is appropriate for  an organization's strategy will be positively related to fi-  nancial performance.  The second type of configurational assertion is similar to a traditional  contingency argument in that both types of arguments assert that the effective-  ness of a firm's HR practices are contingent on firm strategy. The configura-  tional assertion differs from a traditional contingency assertion, however,  because it retains the notion of discrete, ideal-type employment systems that  result in maximal organizational performance. In other words, the second  configurational argument is that a given employment system will enhance  firm performance only when it is used in association with the appropriate  firm strategy. Therefore, the closer the organization's employment system to  the one ideal employment system that is congruent with the organization's  strategy, the more effective the organization.  The most complex configurational interpretation is that two employment  systems, the market type and the internal system, are polar opposites (Kerr &  Slocum, 1987; McKinney, 1966) that define a continuum of effective hybrid  employment systems. These hybrid employment systems are combinations This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1996  Delery and Doty  813  of the initial ideal-type employment systems. This third configurational inter-  pretation implies that there are an infinite number of effective combinations,  or hybrids, of the employment systems that result in horizontal fit. So long  as the hybrid employment system an organization implements falls along  the continuum, the employment system will be effective. However, the orga-  nization must maximize vertical fit in addition to horizontal fit. In order to  maximize vertical fit, the extent to which the organization's employment  system deviates from the ideal-type employment systems that define the  continuum must be exactly proportional to the extent to which the organiza-  tion's strategy deviates from the ideal-type strategies that are consistent with  each ideal-type employment system. For example, if an organization's strat-  egy falls halfway between an analyzer and prospector strategy, then the  organization will be maximally effective only if its employment system falls  halfway between the market type and middle-of-the-road employment sys-  tems. Thus, to maximize performance, the organization must choose the one  hybrid employment system that is appropriate for its strategy. Consistent  with this argument,  Hypothesis 5: An employment system's similarity to the  one hybrid employment system that is appropriate for an  organization's strategy will be positively related to finan-  cial performance.  This third configurational interpretation is very similar to a traditional  contingency assertion. Both types of assertions imply that there are an infinite  number of combinations of HR practices that will lead to superior organiza-  tional performance if they are used in association with the correct strategy.  The primary difference between the two types of assertions involves the  relationships between the HR practices and firm strategy. Contingency argu-  ments focus on the relationships between the individual HR practices and  firm strategy. The configurational assertion, by contrast, retains a system  perspective by focusing on the pattern of relationships among the HR prac-  tices and by constraining the variation in each HR practice to be exactly  proportional to the variation in the system of HR practices.  Summary  The purpose of this study was to articulate and test three different theo-  retical frameworks in strategic human resource management. According to  the universalistic framework, some HR practices are universally effective.  Organizations that adopt these best practices will reap higher profits. In  the contingency framework, the effectiveness of individual HR practices  is contingent on firm strategy. An organization that adopts HR practices  appropriate for its strategy will be more effective. Finally, in the configura-  tional framework there are synergistic effects among HR practices. Thus,  consistency within the configuration of HR practices and between the HR  practices and strategy are necessary to enhance performance.

Sample and Procedures  METHODS  The current study was conducted in a single industry to control for  between-industry differences. The banking industry was selected for several  reasons. First, recent deregulation in this industry is likely to increase the  heterogeneity of strategies used across the industry. Some banks offer a wide  variety of services to a diverse set of customers; others offer a limited set of  services to a largely homogeneous set of customers. Second, a given set of  jobs is relatively stable and common across the industry. These common  jobs provide some control for between-job variation across banks. Third,  government regulations require all banks to report the same types of financial  data in a consistent fashion. Thus, the representitiveness of a sample of banks  will not be biased by failures to report the financial information on which the  dependent variables in the current study are based. These three advantages of  the banking industry were thought to compensate for the loss of generalizabil-  ity that resulted from restricting the study to a single industry.  We selected an initial stratified random sample of 1,050 banks using the  following procedure. First, the total population of banks was stratified into  three assets categories: assets greater than $25 million and less than or equal  to $100 million, assets greater than $100 million and less than or equal to $300  million, and assets greater than $300 million. We then randomly selected 350  banks from each asset category, a process resulting in a total sample of  1,050 banks.  The data from respondents in the banks were collected using two ques-  tionnaires. First, one questionnaire was sent directly to a senior HR manager  in each bank. The HR questionnaire solicited information about the bank's  business strategy and about the HR practices used for specific jobs within  the bank. A description of the relevant jobs adapted from the Dictionary  of Occupational Titles was included with the questionnaire to preclude  confusion about the relevant jobs. After the HR questionnaire was returned,  we sent a second questionnaire directly to the bank's president. This second  questionnaire solicited general information and information about the bank's  strategy. (See the Results section for response rates.)  Measures  The design of this study required a wide range of measures collected  from four different data sources. Measures of the various HR practices were  provided by the HR contact in each bank. Strategy measures were constructed  from the data provided by bank presidents. The dependent measures and  the control measures were drawn from the Sheshunoff Bank Search database,  which contains information obtained from the call reports to the Federal  Reserve that all banks must complete quarterly. The values used to construct This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1996  Delery and Doty  815  the ideal strategic profiles necessary for testing the configurational hypothe-  ses were drawn from the values published by Segev (1989). Finally, the  values used to construct the ideal HR profiles were specified by the data  provided by the HR contact.  HR practices measures. Seven different HR practices were conceptual-  ized and measured. (The Appendix presents the questionnaire items associ-  ated with all measures.) Internal career opportunities referred to the extent  to which a bank had an internal career ladder or internal career opportunities  and was measured as the mean of four 7-point Likert-type items. Higher  scores indicated the existence of a well-defined internal career and staffing  system with greater opportunities. The degree to which training, both formal  and informal, was provided for employees in a job was assessed using the  mean of four Likert-type items. Higher scores reflected more extensive and  formalized training programs for employees. Appraisal was defined as the  degree to which performance appraisals focused on output or results mea-  sures rather than on behavioral measures and was calculated as the mean of  two items. Higher values represented a greater reliance on results or output  measures. Profit sharing was measured with a single item that asked respon-  dents the extent to which employees received bonuses based on an organiza-  tion's profit. Higher responses represented a greater use of profit sharing in  a bank. Employment security was conceptualized as the degree to which an  employee could expect to stay in his or her job over an extended period of  time and was measured as the mean of four items. Higher scores represented  a greater degree of employment security. Employee participation, or voice,  was defined as the degree to which employees were allowed to have input  into their work and the degree to which the organization valued their input;  it was measured as the mean of four items, with higher scores reflecting a  greater amount of participation and voice. Finally, job description referred  to the extent to which jobs were clearly and precisely defined. This measure  was computed as the mean of four items and scored so that higher values  reflected a higher degree of job description.  Strategy measures. The design of the current study required two different  types of strategy variables. First, a single measure of strategy was required  to test the contingency hypotheses. Following previous contingency interpre-  tations of Miles and Snow's theory (Hambrick, 1983, Shortell & Zajac, 1990),  we defined the strategic contingency variable as rate of product/market inno-  vation. Innovation was measured as the mean of six Likert-type items adapted  from Segev (1989) and presented in the Appendix. A second, larger set of  strategy measures was required to test the configurational hypotheses. Thus,  in addition to the six previously mentioned items, nine strategy measures  adapted from Segev (1989) were included in the questionnaire (see the Ap-  pendix). Each of the strategic items included in the questionnaire used a  seven-point Likert-type response scale.  Performance measures. The current study incorporated two financial  measures important to the banking industry as dependent variables: return  on average assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE). The financial measures This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  816  Academy of Management Journal  August  were obtained from the Sheshunoff Bank Search database. The measures of  ROA and ROE were the year-end measures for 1992, the year in which the  surveys were completed.  Control variables. Several control variables were included in the analy-  ses. These data were also obtained from the Sheshunoff Bank Search database.  Bank size was measured as the total dollar value of assets. Bank age was the  number of years from the founding date. A dummy variable was included  to indicate whether a bank was part of a holding company (1 = yes, 0 = no).  Finally, we included a series of dummy variables to control for the Federal  Reserve district in which a bank was located.  Ideal profiles. Tests of the configurational hypotheses required the con-  struction of two sets of ideal profiles: ideal strategic profiles and ideal employ-  ment system profiles. These ideal profiles contain the value of each measure  that best characterizes the relevant ideal type (Doty & Glick, 1994). The ideal  strategic profiles, operationally defined as the values for each ideal type  reported by Segev (1989), are reported in Table 2. We theoretically specified  the values for the ideal employment system profiles using the approach  initially suggested by Govindarajan (1988) and operationally defined them  using the values reported in Table 2. The ideal profile for the middle-of-the-  road system was specified as the mean value for each of the relevant variables.

This approach ensures  that for each variable the relevant position of the employment system is  consistent with the substantive theory and that the values for individual  profiles are consistent with those for the banks in the sample.  Configurational fit measures. We computed the measures of configura-  tional fit that assessed the similarity of an organization to an ideal profile  using the mathematical models presented by Doty and associates (Doty &  Glick, 1994; Doty et al., 1993). Ideal-types fit was used to test Hypothesis 3 and  was operationally defined as the additive inverse of the deviation between a  real organization's employment system and the ideal employment system  that the organization most closely resembled. Contingent ideal-types fit, used  to test Hypothesis 4, was measured as the additive inverse of the deviation  between an organization's employment system and the ideal employment  system that was appropriate for the ideal strategic type most similar to the  organization's strategy. Finally, contingent hybrid-types fit, used to test Hy-  pothesis 5, was defined as the additive inverse of the deviation between the  organization's employment system and a hybrid ideal employment system  most consistent with the organization's strategy. In each of the three measures  of configurational fit, the computation of the final similarity indexes was  restricted to the HR practice measures.  Analysis  A key concept in the SHRM literature is that employment systems should  be designed to maximize performance in the jobs that are most critical to an  organization's performance. Thus, we limited the current analyses to the job  of loan officer because this job was common to all banks, was determined  to be one of the most important jobs in banks, and was critical to bank  performance (Delery, 1993). The approach taken here is similar to those of  Osterman (1994) and Arthur (1992, 1994). Osterman argued that there should  be variation in the practices used to manage different employee groups within  an organization but that it should be most important to investigate the use  of practices for "core" employee groups. Arthur (1992) limited his studies  in steel minimills to maintenance and production workers, likely to be the  core employees in that context. Limiting the analyses to a single job may  reduce the generalizability of results, but the alternative-measuring HR  practices as a composite that was a weighted sum of the practices used across  broad job catgories-was likely to dilute the observed relationships between  the HR practices and organizational performance. Thus, limiting the analyses  to a single, critical job in an organization is consistent with prior work  and should increase the accuracy of the tests of the relevant theoretical  perspectives.  Each hypothesis was tested using hierarchical regression analyses. The  tests were based on changes in the level of explained variation before and after  the variable of interest was added to the set of control variables. Significant  changes in the adjusted R2 provided support for the hypotheses.

This total represented a 21 percent response rate. These respondents had an  average tenure with their banks of 12.24 years and an average tenure in their  current jobs of 5.32 years. A total of 114 usable questionnaires were returned  from the bank presidents. This total represented a 53 percent response rate  from banks that received the second questionnaire and an 11 percent response  rate from the overall sample. Bank presidents had an average tenure with  their bank of 13.43 years and an average tenure as president of 5.89 years.  Response Bias Check  The analyses used to test the hypotheses in the current study drew on  data from multiple sources and thus were based on different sample sizes.  Given these differences, we conducted two analyses to check for response  bias. First, we assessed whether characteristics of individual banks made  their HR managers less likely to complete and return the survey. Following  the work of Osterman (1994), we used a logistic regression with the dependent  variable defined as a dummy variable coded 1 if an HR director responded  and 0 if he or she did not. The independent variables included whether the  bank was federally or state chartered, total equity, total deposits, total loans,  total cash, total assets, total income, holding company ownership, and age.  None of the variables were significant. Next, we investigated whether there  were characteristics of banks that made their presidents less likely to com-  plete and return the questionnaire. As above, we used a logistic regression  analysis; the variables included in the equation included ROA, ROE, total  assets, age, and holding company ownership. Again, no significant differ-  ences were detected. The lack of significant results in these two analyses  indicated that response bias was not a significant problem in the current data.  Universalistic Hypotheses  Table 3 presents means, standard deviations, correlations, and reliabili-  ties (where appropriate). Moderate correlations between several of the HR  practices indicate that these practices are not completely independent. Three  of the HR practices are significantly related to either or both ROA and ROE:  results-oriented appraisal (r = .13, p < .05; r = .09, p < .10), employment  security (r = .17, p < .01; r = .08, n.s.), and profit sharing (r = .22, p < .01;  r = .16, p < .01). These results support some of the relationships specified  in Hypothesis 1.  We conducted two additional types of analyses to further test Hypothesis  1. First, ROA and ROE were used as the dependent variables in a set of  hierarchical regressions. The seven HR practices were independently entered  into the equation after the set of control variables had been entered. These  results indicate that three of the seven HR practices explained a significant  incremental level of the variance in ROA. The use of results-oriented apprais-  als was positively related to ROA (AR2 = .02, F = 4.64, p < .05) and marginally This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  Means, Standard Deviations, Reliabilities, and Correlations among Variablesa  TABLE 3  Variables Mean s.d. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  1.

This pattern  indicates that banks using results-oriented appraisals to manage their loan  officers achieved higher returns. Employment security and profit sharing  were both positively related to ROA (AR2 = .023, F = 6.06, p < .01, and AR2 =  .086, F = 24.38, p < .001, respectively), and profit sharing was significantly  related to ROE (AR2 = .07, F = 20.34, p < .001). This result suggests that  the greater employment security given to loan officers, the greater the returns  to banks. In addition, banks that used profit sharing to a greater extent also  performed better.  To further test Hypothesis 1, we entered all the HR practices simultane-  ously into two hierarchical regression equations, one predicting ROA and  one predicting ROE. The results of these two additional analyses, which are  presented in Table 4, are entirely consistent with the individual analyses  discussed above. When entered simultaneously, the HR practices were able  to explain an additional 12.55 percent of variance (p < .01) in ROA and an  additional 9 percent of variance (p < .01) in ROE over what the controls  explained. Thus, the results provide relatively strong support for Hypothe-  sis 1.  Results of these two regressions can also be discussed in terms of ROA  and ROE. Banks one standard deviation higher than the average on profit  sharing are estimated to be 0.17 and 1.96 higher on ROA and ROE, respec-  tively. Additionally, banks one standard deviation higher on results-oriented  appraisals and job security are estimated to be 0.08 and 0.09 higher on ROA,  and 0.98 and 0.63 higher on ROE.

Contingency Hypothesis  Hypothesis 2 states that the relationships between HR practices and  performance are contingent on an organization's strategy. These contingency  predictions can be evaluated by determining whether an HR practice-strategy  interaction term significantly increases the level of explained variation in  a hierarchical regression analysis. Thus, we ran a total of 14 hierarchical  regression analyses, seven predicting ROA and seven predicting ROE. In the  first step of each analysis, the control variables, the strategy measure, and a  single HR practice measure were included. In the second step, the interaction  term between the single HR practice and the strategy measure was added to  the regression equation.  The results indicate that none of the interaction terms significantly in-  creased the explained variation in ROA, and only the appraisal-strategy  interaction term explained a significant portion of the variance in ROE  (AR2 = .038, F = 5.55, p < .05). No other interactions were significant. These  analyses provide virtually no support for Hypothesis 2.  One explanation for the null results is that the combination of HR prac-  tices a firm uses is more important than specific, individual practices. For  example, Huselid (1993, 1995) argued that a more accurate assessment of  the relationships between HR practices and performance can be made when  all HR practices are simultaneously included in analyses. Therefore, we  conducted two post hoc hierarchical regressions (one for ROA and one for  ROE) in which all seven HR practices were included in the first step and  the interaction terms between each of the HR practice measures and the  innovation measure were included in the second step.3 The increase in the  level of explained variation was marginally significant for ROE (AR2 = .087,  F = 1.82, p < .10) and approached marginal significance for ROA (AR2 =  .081, F = 1.68, p = .13). Two of the individual interaction terms in the  equation predicting ROE and three of the interaction terms in the equation  predicting ROA were significant, as were both of the overall equations. Table  5 presents these results. When the interaction terms that were not significant  in either equation were removed from the analyses, the interaction between  innovation and career opportunities, results-oriented appraisals, and partici-  pation explained an additional 7 percent of variance in ROA (AR2 = .071, F =  3.53, p < .05) and an additional 7.4 percent of the variance in ROE (AR2 =  .074, F = 3.71, p < .05).  An analysis of the interaction terms showed that prospector banks had  higher ROA and ROE when using results-oriented appraisals. Conversely,  3 We conducted the analyses after mean-centering all variables (Cronbach, 1987; Jaccard,  Turrisi, & Wan, 1990; Stone, 1988), because there was relatively high multicollinearity among  the independent variables, particularly among the interaction terms.

In a similar fashion, defender banks obtained higher  ROA and ROE the more they allowed loan officers to participate in decision  making. The reverse was true of prospectors. Finally, ROA and ROE were  greatest for prospector banks when there were greater internal career opportu-  nities for loan officers. Again, the reverse was true for defenders.  From the regression equations presented in Table 5, the mean effect on  ROA and ROE of having HR practices consistent with strategy was estimated.  For instance, the results show that among prospector banks (banks one stan-  dard deviation above the mean on the strategy variable), those that were also  one standard deviation above the mean on internal career opportunities and  results-oriented appraisals were estimated to have an ROE 6.52 higher than  those at the mean on those practices.  These post hoc results indicate that there is support for some of the  contingency relationships posited in Hypothesis 2. Thus, the contingency  perspective should not be rejected out of hand.

Future studies will have to investigate these rela-  tionships more fully.  Configurational Hypotheses  Prior to testing the configurational hypotheses, we classified each bank  according to the ideal employment system it most closely resembled. Table  6 reports the number of banks with employment systems most similar to  each ideal employment system and the means and standard deviations of  each HR practice for each group of banks. In addition, the F-values reported  in Table 6 indicate that there are significant differences among the groups  of banks.  The first configurational hypothesis, Hypothesis 3, states that similarity  to the one ideal-type employment system most similar to an organization's  employment system will be positively related to organizational performance.  In other words, if a bank's employment system resembled the market-type  system more than other systems, the greater that similarity, the stronger the  performance.  To test Hypothesis 3, we first computed the appropriate similarity mea-  sure (i.e., ideal-types fit) and then entered this measure in the second step  of a hierarchical regression. (The first step of the hierarchical regression  contained each of the control variables.) The ideal-types measure of fit did  not add significantly to the explained variation in either analysis (ROA: AR2 =  .008, F = 1.91, n.s.; ROE: AR2 = .008, F = 1.95, n.s.). Thus, Hypothesis 3  was not supported.  Description of HR Types and Comparison of Meansa  TABLE 6  Employment Systems  Middle-of-  Market the-Road Internal  HR Practices Mean s.d. Mean s.d. Mean s.d.

To test this hypothesis, we computed  the contingency ideal-types measure of fit and entered the result into hierar-  chical regression equations predicting ROA and ROE. The results show that  this measure was unable to explain a significant amount of variance in either  ROA (AR2 = .00, F = .00, n.s.) or ROE (AR2 = .002, F = .22, n.s.). Thus,  Hypothesis 4 was not supported.  The third configurational hypothesis, Hypothesis 5, predicts that similar-  ity to the one hybrid employment system appropriate for an organization's  strategy will be positively related to organizational performance. To test this  hypothesis, we computed the contingent hybrid-types measure of fit and  then entered this measure into hierarchical regression equations in the same  manner as in previous analyses. The results of these regressions do not  support Hypothesis 5. Similarity to the appropriate hybrid employment sys-  tem did not explain a significant amount of variance in either ROA (AR2 =  .001, F = .11, n.s.) or ROE (AR2 = .02, F = 2.01, n.s.).  One plausible explanation for the null results associated with the con-  figurational perspective is that too many or too few ideal employment systems  were included in the analyses. Altering the set of ideal types included in  the test of a theory can have a substantial effect on the results of the test  (Doty, 1994). Thus, prior to abandoning the configurational perspective, we  conducted an exploratory post hoc analysis.  The most parsimonious configurational theory would posit that a single  ideal employment system will result in maximal organizational performance.  To determine if any one of the employment systems described in this article  was superior to the others, we calculated the similarity between the organiza-  tions' employment systems and each of the ideal employment systems. Each  of the similarity measures was then entered into a separate hierarchical  regression equation predicting the financial measures. The results of these  analyses show that deviations from the internal and the market-type employ-  ment systems were both related to ROA (AR2 = .03, F = 7.33, p < .01; AR2 =  .06, F = 15.51, p < .01) and ROE (AR2 = .02, F = 5.44, p < .05; AR2 = .05,  F = 13.20, p < .01). The more closely an organization's employment system  resembled the market-type system, the higher the ROA and ROE. The reverse  was true for the internal system. These results show that ROA and ROE are  estimated to be 0.14 and 1.67 higher, respectively, for banks that are one  standard deviation from the mean closer to the market-type employment  system than the average bank. Although this effect is not nearly as large as  those for the universalistic and contingency results, it still represents a sizable  difference on these measures.  These results indicate that the market-type system is superior to both  of the other two employment systems and provide limited support for the  configurational perspective. However, when the individual HR practices  were used simultaneously to predict performance, they explained a greater  portion of the variation in the dependent variables than did the market-type This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1996  Delery and Doty  825  system. Thus, the market-type system should not be labeled the best system  but rather should be viewed as the starting point for constructing an ideal-  type employment system in future studies.  DISCUSSION  The results of this study provided relatively strong support for a univer-  salistic perspective and some support for both the contingency and configu-  rational perspectives. Three individual HR practices, profit sharing, results-  oriented appraisals, and employment security, had relatively strong univer-  salistic relationships with important accounting measures of performance.  Contingency relationships between strategy and three HR practices-  participation, results-oriented appraisals, and internal career opportuni-  ties-explained a significant portion of the variation in the same performance  measures. Finally, similarity to the market-type employment system was  also positively related to firm performance. In combination, these results  demonstrate that managing human resources as prescribed by each of the  different perspectives enhances organizational performance.  It is clear from the statistical analyses that there is strong support for  the universalistic perspective. More important, the results of these analyses  show that differences in HR practices are associated with rather large differ-  ences in financial performance. For instance, financial performance was esti-  mated to be approximately 30 percent higher for banks one standard deviation  above the mean on each of the three significant practices than it was for  those banks at the mean. These results appear to be even stronger than those  of previous research (Huselid, 1995). In addition, the present results are  consistent with the theoretical work to date.  The universalistic support for the effectiveness of results-oriented ap-  praisals is consistent with agency theory (Eisenhardt, 1988; Fama, 1980;  Fama & Jensen, 1983), control theory (Snell, 1991), and the transaction cost  perspective (Jones & Wright, 1992). Each of these theoretical perspectives  implies that results-oriented appraisals will enhance performance when mea-  sures of the desired results are either readily available or are less costly to  obtain than other performance measures. Banks regularly collect and calcu-  late results-oriented measures for the job of loan officer, such as default rate  and number of nonperforming loans. Thus, the monitoring costs associated  with these measures are extremely low. Behavioral measures for loan officers,  on the other hand, are much more difficult to define and expensive to monitor.  Each of the three theories implies that the use of behavioral control mecha-  nisms for loan officers would be counterproductive, perhaps as a conse-  quence of these difficulties.  The universalistic relationship between the use of profit sharing and  performance also supports both an agency theory and a behavioral theory  explanation. Agency theory posits that basing employee rewards on profits  ensures that employee interests are aligned with owner interests. The cost of  monitoring profits for a profit-sharing plan is negligible because government  regulations require banks to report profit measures. In addition, many profit- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  826  Academy of Management Journal  August  sharing plans do not distribute profits equally among employees. Instead,  profits are distributed differentially according to employee performance. As  discussed above, measures of loan officer performance are readily available.  In terms of the behavioral perspective, profit sharing may be seen as universal-  istic because, by definition, all banks strive for profit. By tying individual  compensation to organizational profit, the organization is rewarding behavior  that is consistent with its overall performance.  The third HR practice that had a universalistic effect on performance  was employment security. The effects of employment security are somewhat  more difficult to explain in terms of the theories mentioned above. Granting  employment security without monitoring employee performance does not  assure that employees will engage in the appropriate behaviors. However,  employment security may marginally align the interests of employees and  owners. If the employees fail to perform in a way that generates continued  profits for the organization, the organization may cease to exist, thereby  ending the guarantee of employment security. Further, employment security  sends a signal that an organization is committed to its workforce. If employees  reciprocate this commitment, the organization should have a workforce with  a high level of commitment and motivation. This is a key principle behind  the rise of high performance-high commitment work systems (Lawler, 1986;  Lawler, Mohrman, & Ledford, 1992), and it is the cornerstone of several organi-  zations' HR management strategy. For instance, Lincoln Electric has for many  years successfully employed an HR system that is characterized by lifetime  employment.  The contingency results provide support for the strategic focus of the  SHRM literature. The post hoc analyses revealed that the links between organi-  zational performance and three HR practices-performance appraisal, partici-  pation, and internal career opportunities-are contingent on strategy. In gen-  eral, banks that were able to align their HR practices with strategy are estimated  to have nearly 50 percent higher ROA and ROE than those banks whose HR  practices were just one standard deviation out of alignment. Specifically,  banks that implemented a prospector strategy involving high innovation  reaped greater returns from more results-oriented appraisals and lower levels  of employee participation than did banks that relied on a defender strategy.  Banks implementing a defender strategy performed better if they relied less on  results-oriented appraisals and gave their loan officers higher levels of partici-  pation in decision making and voice. These findings are consistent with the  behavioral perspective of Miles and Snow's (1984) strategic theory.  The direction of the relationship between internal career opportunities  and strategy was opposite that hypothesized. Miles and Snow (1984) and  Sonnenfeld and Peiperl (1988) both explicitly stated that internal career  paths should be more consistent with the defender strategy. The reverse  was true in the current study. Prospector banks with more internal career  opportunities for their loan officers had higher returns than did defenders.  One explanation for this unexpected finding involves the high mobility of  talented employees within the banking industry. Talented employees may This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1996  Delery and Doty  827  be likely to change jobs unless their banks offer internal career opportunities.  Prospectors were able to keep talent in the organization only if that talent  saw future opportunities. In addition, greater opportunities for advancement  into a variety of different positions may help prospector banks attract spe-  cially skilled employees. Defender banks would most likely not be able to  match the variety of opportunities, given their focus on stable markets, and  consequently they would focus on other aspects for recruitment. Additional  theoretical and empirical work is needed to more fully explore the relation-  ship between internal career opportunities, strategy, and performance.  The configurational results suggest that some configurations of HR prac-  tices are better than others. For example, the more closely a bank's employment  system resembled the market-type system, the higher its performance. Con-  versely, HR systems that more closely resembled the internal system resulted  in decreased organizational performance. In terms of ROA and ROE, a decrease  in distance from the market-type system of one standard deviation from the  mean is estimated to result in a 13 percent increase in financial performance.  Our interpretations of the configurational results are the most speculative.  First, most configurational theorists argue for multiple effective configura-  tions of the relevant parameters. For example, our a priori arguments and  the arguments of Miles and Snow (1984), Sonnenfeld and Peiperl (1988),  and others identify multiple maximally effective HR configurations. The  configurational analyses we conducted, however, identified a single HR con-  figuration that resulted in better performance. Thus, although the configura-  tional results support the notion that future SHRM researchers should con-  sider employment systems, the current results do not allow us to argue for  multiple, equally effective employment systems.  A second limitation to the configurational results presented in this article  involves level of explained variation. The key assertion imbedded in config-  urational theories is that the ideal configurations represent nonlinear syner-  gistic effects of the dimensions used to construct the configurations (Meyer  et al., 1993). In the current results, however, the variation explained in the  configurational analyses did not exceed the variation explained when the  individual dimensions were simultaneously used to predict performance.  Thus, we cannot make strong arguments that synergy among the HR practices  under investigation enhance organizational performance. So although the  configurational approach appears to hold promise for SHRM researchers,  additional theory development and testing are necessary to validate the effi-  cacy of the configurational perspective.4  4 We do not discuss the use of difference scores as a plausible explanation for the null  results because the configurational fit methodology differs substantially from the traditional  difference score approach. For example, in the current study we calculated the deviation between  each real organization and one of two discrete points in multidimensional space. Thus, the  point of reference for the deviation analysis associated with the ideal-types model of fit does  not vary for each organization in the sample, as it would for the difference score approach. As  a result of such substantive differences, many of the limitations typically associated with the  use of difference scores are not limitations of the configurational fit methodology.

We have demonstrated that three different  modes of theorizing are incorporated in that literature: universalistic, contin-  gency, and configurational perspectives. The results reported in this study  indicate that each of these perspectives is viable and leads to different as-  sumptions about the relationships among HR practices, strategy, and organi-  zational performance. Future theorists should clearly articulate the perspec-  tive they are using to structure their arguments and test their arguments with  an analytical strategy that is consistent with the relevant perspective.  A second contribution of this study is that it explicitly links characteris-  tics of an organization's employment system to organizational performance.  To date, only a few other studies have attempted to make this link. For  example, Huselid (1995) and Arthur (1994) showed that HR practices can  have a significant impact on organizationally relevant performance measures.  Like Huselid's and Arthur's findings, the current findings indicate that some  HR practices always have a positive effect on organizational performance.  Further, this study is one of the few to document that the relationships  between some HR practices and organizational performance are contingent  on firm strategy. Thus, the results of the current study suggest different  theoretical frameworks are necessary to represent the different forms of rela-  tionships between HR practices and organizational performance.  The current study differs from these previous studies, however, because  our results suggest a stronger relationship between HR practices and mea-  sures of financial performance. Arthur (1992, 1994) did not assess the rela-  tionship between HR practices and financial performance, and Huselid's  (1995) results explained only 1 to 3 percent of the variation in financial  performance. In contrast with these previous studies, the universalistic, con-  tingency, and configurational analyses incorporated in the current study  explained as much as 11, 10, and 6 percent, respectively, of the variation in  financial performance. Thus, the current work indicates that HR practices  may be even more important than was previously suspected. The current  results must be interpreted with caution, however, because the inclusion of  other determinants of both the HR practices and financial performance may  reduce the variation explained by the HR practices alone.  The results of this study also have applied implications for organizations.  First, organizations that adopt best HR practices can generate greater returns.  Such practices include profit sharing, results-oriented appraisals, and greater  employment security. Huselid (1995) pointed out that although organizations  may not be able to sustain a competitive advantage because these practices  are imitable (Barney, 1991), many organizations are not currently using these  more effective practices. Thus, in the short run, organizations that adopt a  greater number of these practices are likely to gain a short-term competitive  advantage and enjoy superior performance. Pfeffer (1994), however, pointed This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1996  Delery and Doty  829  out that the implementation of these practices is not always an easy task.  Therefore, he argued that it is unlikely that organizations can quickly or  easily imitate the practices of the best organizations. If this is true, it may  be even more important for newly established, or "greenfield," facilities to  spend a great deal of time and effort ensuring that their employment systems  are in fact consistent with high performance (Ichniowski et al., 1994).  The universal adoption of all HR practices, however, is not completely  appropriate. The results presented in this study indicate a more complex  relationship between the management of human resources and organizational  performance. Some HR practices are more appropriate under certain strategic  conditions and less appropriate under others. Thus, the current results sup-  port the primary assertion in the SHRM literature. Human resource managers  must align some key organizational HR practices with business strategy (Jack-  son & Schuler, 1995). At least three practices, internal career opportunities,  results-oriented appraisals, and participation/voice, may exhibit this contin-  gency relationship. Future research will likely identify other HR practices  that must be consistent with an organization's strategy.  Future SHRM research will undoubtedly increase the complexity of the  HR manager's job. HR managers should not only keep current with the most  effective universalistic practices, but should also be aware of the HR practices  that work in concert with the greater goals of the organization's strategy.  However, future SHRM research will likely provide more evidence that the  manner in which an organization manages its employees has a bottom-line  impact. Such research should aid HR managers in their quest to achieve  greater status and control in their organizations.  Despite the contributions of this study, several factors limit the generaliz-  ability and usefulness of the findings. First, we limited the study to the  banking industry to control for between-industry differences. Thus, the re-  sults may not be valid in other industries. Although several authors (Huselid,  1995; Pfeffer, 1994) have argued that it is unlikely that the best HR practices  vary across industries, the current findings need to be validated in other  industries to rule out industry as an important contingency factor. Second,  this study was limited to a single job within the banking industry, that of  loan officer, selected because it represented a core job within banks and is  critical to bank performance. This approach is consistent with previous work  (Arthur, 1992, 1994; Osterman, 1994), but characteristics of this job may  limit the generalizability of the findings. For example, a loan officer's job is  very professionalized and requires considerable training and education. The  HR practices that are best for this type of job may differ from those that  are best for semiskilled or trade-oriented jobs. Thus, future studies should  investigate whether alternative HR practices are better suited for other types  of jobs. Third, this study is limited because it included a relatively small set  of the population of HR practices currently used by organizations. Although  the HR practices included in this research are generally thought to be strategic  and were derived from existing theory, other HR practices may constitute  best practices, may have important contingency relationships with firm strat- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Mon, 13 Feb 2017 20:23:37 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  830  Academy of Management Journal  August  egy, or may be critical to the specification of alternative ideal configurations  of HR practices.  A fourth limitation of this study is the use of a cross-sectional research  design. Although we have argued that the effective use of HR practices should  lead to stronger performance, our cross-sectional design does not allow us  to rule out the possibility that organizations performing well adopt a greater  number of high-quality HR practices. The issue of causality can be better  addressed in longitudinal designs. Doing so would be an enormous task  given the large number of organizations needed; however, we urge future  researchers to adopt such designs. Additionally, future studies that include  other organizational attributes that are related to both HR practices and  organizational performance are needed to provide more accurate estimates  of the full effect of HR practices on organizational performance.
