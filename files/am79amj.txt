On the Measurement of Corporate Social Responsibility: Self-Reported Disclosures as a Method  of Measuring Corporate Social Involvement^ WALTER  F.  ABBOTT University  of  Kentucky R.  JOSEPH  MONSEN University  of  Washington This article develops a corporate social involvement disclosure scale based on a content  analysis of  the an- nual  reports of  the  Fortune  500 companies.  Three  re- sults are shown: (J) the change over time of these corpo- rations' social involvement,  (2) the direction and scope of  this  involvement,  and  (3) the  effect  that corporate social involvement  appears to  have on  corporate pro- fitability. A peculiar paradox of American economic history is that the large cor- poration  has  been,  at  one  and  the  same  time,  the  symbol  of  economic progress and  yet a consistent  object  of  criticism  for  instituting  problems for which It has traditionally divested itself of responsibility. Growing cor- porate interest in social accounting, which is intended to provide the firm with  usable  measures  of  social  involvement,  indicates  recent  corporate awareness of its linkage to society. The empirical study of corporate social involvement,  however,  is in an undeveloped  state. In  Europe,  state  owned  firms  in  both  France  and  England  have  at- tempted  "social contracts" that would record and pay the firms for social activities—apart  from  their profit  making functions.  In the United States there has been a frequent  call over the past few years, recently in 1978 by acknowledge  the  advice  and  assistance  of  Kenneth  D.  Walters,  Kavasseri  V "^ Ronald Rauch in K S T ' ^ '™  """""'"  ''^"' °^^'^  '^'"^ " ° ' "'  501 502  Academy  of  Management  Journal  September : Secretary of Commerce Kreps, that a social activities report be developed by corporations. As yet,  of  course,  neither  the U.S. government  nor  the accounting profession  has required  such an annual report.  However,  the time may not be far off when firms dealing with the U.S. government may have to do even more in social accounting than report their affirmative ac- tion activities. •  Although  the  literature  on  corporate  social  responsibilities  is  now substantial,  measurement  in  this  branch  of  organizational  research  is undeveloped  in comparison  with  measurement  in other  areas. There  are two basic difficulties  in measuring corporate  social involvement  for  pur- poses of research. The first is the unavailability of detailed information  in quantitative (monetary and other forms) terms of the social activities that have relevance  for  the  general  rubric  of  social  responsibilities.  For  pur- poses  of  research,  furthermore,  the  activities  must  be  measured  and reported  consistently  across  a  large  number  of  firms  in  order  to  enable statistical  analyses. The second: difficulty  is that  a methodology  must  be devised by researchers to measure the full impact of known corporate ac- tivities  on  society.  Whereas  the  first  problem  is  one  of  enlisting  full cooperation  from  tiie  firms  themselves  to  obtain  such  information,  the latter is one of scientific knowledge that is the responsibility of researchers of the business system, not the corporations. As a result of the combined effects  of  these two  factors,  the prospects  are not  promising  in the  near future  for developing measures of social activities that are convincing and useful  for  policy purposes in registering the linkage between the corpora- tion and society. An adequate measure of  corporate social activities must be based on a method of data collection in which the investigator (researcher, public in- terest  group,  governmental  agency,  corporate  researcher,  etc.)  has unrestricted access to data on the full  range of activities of the firm.  The contents  of  this  scale  must  be  independently  defined  and  must  measure any form of behavior that is of policy interest. This is the equivalent of the social  survey  typically  used  in  social  research  except  that  the  unit  of analysis is the organization and not the individual. Although there are no such sources at present, there are three types of published research that at- tempt to derive usable measures of corporate social activities: (1) social ac- counting,  (2) reputational  scales,  and  (3) content  analysis  of  corporate publications. Whereas  accounting  traditionally  is considered  to  be  a  body  of  tech- niques for recording the financial transactions of a firm, the goal of social accounting is to add categories pertaining to the social impact of the firm into the firm's formalized  accounting system. But, as Ramanathan notes, "A  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  social  impact  of  private  enterprise suffers  at the present time from  a general absence of  reliable data on ag- gregate  social costs and  benefits  of  business..."  (1976, p.  516).  It  thus must  be  acknowledged  that  social  accounting  is  not  now  at  a  stage  at which the results can be used for decision making purposes. Indeed, in the '''°  Abbott  and Monsen  .  503 1975  report  by  the  American  Accounting  Association's  Committee  on Social Costs the committee was able only to indicate exploratory activities by such  individuals,  organizations,  and journals  as Dennis Beresford  of Ernst and Ernst,  George Steiner of U.C.L.A., Business and Society, and several  consulting  firms.  However,  the  report  clearly  indicates  that  the primary  difficulty  in  developing  a  social  audit  on  a  professional  level is formulating  methods of obtaining quantitative measurements of social ac- tivities and  impacts.  The state of  the art  at  present  is to have developed categories of activities that need measurement and to have become aware of some of the problems in obtaining quantified  data. The reputational  method,  commonly  used in social research  to  obtain the  response  of  a  public  to  a  social  phenomenon,  is a  second  source of data on corporate social responsibilities. Limited scales have been derived from responses from two groups: business students and corporate staffers. Heinze  (1976)  reports  how  the  student  survey  was  made.  The  National Association of Concerned Business Students polled  150 graduate students regarding  the  social involvement  of  a sample of  large corporations.  The results were published originally in 1972. The responses were registered on a Likert-type scale ranging from  1 (very poor) to 5 (outstanding). A  "no opinion" was assigned a zero. The mean score was the reputed  corporate involvement  score.  Of  the 28 corporations  that  Heinze  reported,  Xerox was highest  with a score of 4.12. Standard  Oil of  California  (1.97), U S Steel (2.00), and Bethlehem Steel (2.25), were at the lower end. There thus vyas substantial variation in the scores. Vance (1975) reported the applica- tion  of  the  same methodology  but  using  86 corporate  staffers  to  obtain ratings of 45 major  corporations. The study was conducted in 1972. IBM (4.0) was at the upper end; Standard Oil of California (2.3) and Bethlehem Steel (2.4) again were at the lower end. A basic difficulty  in the use of the reputational method in studying cor- porate  social  involvement  is  that  the  respondents  providing  the  ratings must be in a position to have detailed information  about the corporations in the sample. What is being studied is actually the image of a corporation, which is highly influenced by the corporation's size, age, and access to the mass media, as well as by the experience of the respondent in the business world. Changes in corporate names because of mergers and other reasons also are a complicating factor.  How much confidence  thus can be put on knowledge about the inner workings of a large corporation by an outside public? A second basic difficulty  is that the reputational method limits the number  of  corporations  to be rated.  It is easily possible, for  example,  to ask respondents to assess 10 to 20 objects. This may be accomplished in a few minutes of time and may be achieved with a one or two page question- naire. The respondents may even be asked to rank  30 or 40 objects. (Oc- cupational  prestige  studies  even ask  respondents  for  responses  on  up  to 110 occupations.) However, there is a need, at the very minimum, to assess the corporate behavior of the entire Fortune 500 industrials. 504  Academy  of  Management  Journal  September The third  source  of  information  is the  content  analysis  of  documents and reports of corporations intended  for  communication  purposes. Such sources of information  include annual reports, personnel handbooks, and employee  newspapers.  Media  sources  include  advertising  and  news releases  in  papers,  journals,  radio,  and  television.  Speeches  of  top  ex- ecutives  are  another  source  (Hull,  1971; Bunting,  1971).  Bowman  and Haire (1975), for example, have reported the results of a content analysis of  the  annual  reports  of  82  food-processing  firms  listed  in  the  1973 Moody's  Industrial Manual. Their measure of social involvement was the percentage of the space in annual reports pertaining to corporate respon- sibilities and activities. They found,  for example, that the average was 3.63 percent,  although  six  firms  devoted  20  to  23  percent  of  their  annual reports  to  corporate  responsibilities.  Their  scale  is  limited,  however.  It does not indicate the breakdown by issue area.  It also is restricted to the food-processing  industry.  However,  the  scale  used  has  the  value  of  in- dicating an aggregate measure of concern with corporate responsibilities. The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  pursue  the  use  of  self-reported disclosures  as a  means of  constructing  a quantitative  scale, identified  as the  Social  Involvement  Disclosure (SID)  scale,  obtained  from  a  content analysis of the annual reports of theFor/w/ie 500. There are two tasks. The first is to discuss the methodological problems of content analysis in con- structing the SID scale. The second is to report three uses of the SID scale in  analyzing  the  Fortune  500:  (a) to  show  their  responses  to  corporate criticism  and  governmental  pressure  and  regulation,  (b) to  show  the dimensions  of  such  corporate  responses  to  current  social  pressures,  and (c) to  indicate the  implications  of  social  involvement  for  corporate  pro- fitability. METHOD in  anecdotal  and  literary  form  Content analysis is a technique for gathering data that consists of codi- fying  qualitative  information  into categories in order to derive quantitative scales of  varying levels of com- plexity. The simplest of content analyses consists of nothing more than the attribution of the incidence of an event as indicated by the mention of the event  under  question  in  the  literary  document  that  constitutes  the  raw data.  In this simple analysis, therefore,  the dichotomy is the only level of measure that  may be achieved  for  each category.  However,  if more than one category is subjected  to  a content  analysis, a more complex level of measurement  may  be  achieved  through  the  summing  of  the  results  for each category. Thus, if each category is assigned a score of zero or one, in- dicating  the  absence  or  presence  of  the  attribute  under  analysis,  the resulting scale varies between zero and the number of attributes jjeing in- vestigated. The codification of the data from the Fortune 500 was performed by the "Big-8" accounting firm of Ernst and Ernst under the direction of partner 1979 Abbott  and  Monsen 505 Denms  R.  Beresford  (1974a,  1974b,  1975,  1976; Beresford  & Feldman, 1976). Beginning in  1971, Ernst  and  Ernst  has developed  an  annual  un- published  summary reporting  whether  the annual reports of  the Fortune 500 indicated activities for specific social involvement categories. The SID scale  is  the  sum  of  the  items  mentioned  for  each  firm.  The  number  of categories used for  coding varies slightly by year. For the 1973 index, the score ranged  from  zero to a high value of  23. For  1974, the score had  a high value of 24.

The issues (environment,  equal  opportunity, product  quality,  etc.)  reflect  the  criticisms  that  are  currently  being  en- countered  by the modern corporation  and also are the targets of govern- mental  regulation.  Environment  and  the  specific  problem  of  pollution control  have  received  substantial  attention  in  the  annual  reports  of  the Fortune 500. However, activities of the corporation also have relevance to such  other  currently  critical issues as equal  opportunitites  for  minorities and  females,  general  personnel  policies,  and  involvement  with  the com- munity  and  the  quality  and  safety  of  its  products.  The  location  of  the social  involvement  disclosures  in  the  annual  reports  also  is indicated  in Table 1. Whereas the disclosures in 1973 tended to be distributed more or less equally among the president's letter, a special section,  or the general body  of  the  report,  about  one-half  of  the  disclosures  are  in  the  general body  of  the  1974 reports.  Reporting  social  involvement  activities  of  the firm thus has become institutionalized into the standard reporting system of the large corporation to its shareholders. The most basic issue regarding the annual report as a source of social in- volvement data is whether the reported variation in social activities among firms  is  a  refiection  of  real  activities  or  is  only  an  index  of  company policies on communicating activities to shareholders. There are theoretical reasons to expect the corporation to underreport its social involvement ac- tivities. Since social involvement  activities are also costs, reading of  such social activities by shareholders can be taken to mean that the firm's man- agement  is  failing  to  put  highest  priority  on  the  interests  of  the  share- holders by not maximizing income available to be distributed as dividends (Friedman,  1970). Why  should  management  thus  be  anxious  to  inform stockholders  of  such  expenditures?  On  the  other  hand,  the  alternative view is that  stockholders  have a vested  interest in the stability and legiti- macy of the entrepreneurial institution and the autonomy of that  institu- tion  from  state  control.  Aware,  then,  of  the  criticisms  that  have  been made of the corporation, reading of its progressive views on social respon- sibilities  in  the  annual  report  can  enhance  confidence  of  the  politically savvy  shareholder  in  management's  policies.  In  addition  to  managerial concern  with  stockholder  response,  staff  effectiveness  and  sensitivity  to issues also are a determinant of reporting activities. Theoretical arguments thus may be presented that the annual reports both overreport and under- report the social involvement activities of the firm. Even if it is assumed that the annual reports accurately refiect the social activities of  the firm, other problems of  a methodological  nature are ap- propriately raised. The raw data in the annual report are not in a state that is immediately usable for  research purposes. In order to use the data it is necessary to formulate  a set of categories and code the raw data in terms of the categories. Errors of  two types thus are possible: (1) the  formula- tion of categories that do not refiect all the issues actually contained in the report that are of policy interest and (2) inaccuracy in coding the raw data in terms of the selected categories. These errors thus affec| the validity and '  Abbott  and Monsen  507 reliability of the resulting scale. A third question might be raised regarding the meaning of the variation obtained in the scale. The only meaning that may be attributed to the scale is that it refiects the variety of social involve- ment activities. It does not measure the intensity of each activity. In order to do this, monetary or impact data would be needed. Three  arguments  support  the  use  of  the  SID  scale  in  organizational research.  First,  because  of  the  ready  availability  of  annual  reports,  it is possible to derive social involvement  scores for  large quantities of firms. The  research  costs  are  reasonably  low in  comparison  to  other  forms  of data collection. The annual reports are also public data, thus not requiring cooperation from  the firms. (Response rates in voluntary business surveys often  are extremely low.) Reputational scales do not aUow such quantities of firms to be rated.  Based on available Ernst and Ernst data, the scale is now available  for  almost  500 firms.  Nor is there a theoretical reason  for limiting the scale to the Fortune 500. Indeed, it would be most useful  for research  purposes  to  extend  the  scale to  other  universes  of  corporations (such as small corporations)  because they are likely to be far less sensitive to  social  involvement  matters  than  are  large  corporations.  Second,  the data are public, and it is possible to replicate the results and thus provide a reliability check on the scale. Reputational  scales, on the other hand, are difficult  to replicate. Third, limited validity may be demonstrated  for the SID scale. Validity pertains to the extent to  which a measuring procedure actually measures the  theoretical  concept  for  which  the  measurement  procedure  was  in- tended.  Is there consistency, then, between the concept (a theoretical con- struct) and the empirical operations used to study the theoretical concept? Validation is the empirical procedure used to test the consistency between the  theoretical  concept  and  the  operationalization  procedures.  "Face" validity, although frequently used, is in fact not an empirical test at aU: the operational  measures  are  simply assessed  on  the  basis  of  their  logic and meaning. A more defendable method of validation is to test a given opera- tional  procedure  for  its  association  with  other  measures  intended  to measure the same thing. A high correlation thus gives greater  confidence m  all  the  measures  under  consideration.  Table  2  attempts  to  assess  the validity  of  the  SID  index  through  its  correlations  with  the  reputational scales based on businessmen and business students reported by Vance and Heinze. (The overlapping  of firms unfortunately  is quite low because of the small number of firms in the reputational studies.) Of the two scales, it is  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  businessmen's  index  is  based  on respondents  with greater  knowledge of  corporate  activities. The correla- tion between the SID scale and the businessman's index is reasonably high (.58),  whereas the correlation  is lower (.33) with the student index.  Both indexes, however, correlate reasonably well with specific issues measured by the SID scale; equal opportunities and community  involvement. 508 Academy  of  Management  Journal September Pearsonian  Correlations  Between  Social  Involvement  Disclosures, Businessmen's  and Business Students'  Social  Responsibility  Indexes TABLE  2 SID  Correlations  with Fortune 5(X) Social  Involvement Disclosures: 1973-1974 Total  index Environment Equal  opportunity Personnel Community  involvement Products Other  disclosures Businessmen's Index (N=23) .58 .22 .66 .11 .41 .49 .62 Business Students'  Index (N=22) .33 -.34 .50 .01 .53 .08 .26 Response to External Pressure RESULTS The  modern,  especially  large  corporation  is  subject  to  pressure  from both  the  public  in  general  and  government  regulatory  agencies  in  par- ticular. (Indeed, the two sources of pressure undoubtedly are correlated.)

Identical questions on confidence in institutional leadership were included in the General Social Surveys of 1973-1975 (Davis, 1977). The Harris data (1966-1973) mdicate that a general decline of confidence in American in- stitutions had occurred at least by 1971. The GSS data (1973-1975) reveal that  this  confidence  had not been  regained  by 1975. Confidence  in  big business leadership  declined  from  55 percent to 27 percent in the Harris polls. The GSS data  for 1973-1975 indicate additional  decline. The  1975 report indicated that only 20 percent of Americans had great confidence in big business leadership. Although it is essential to consider the decline of confidence in business as part of a syndrome, it is striking that the decline of  confidence  in big business is on the same order as the decline in con- fidence,  in  the executive  and legislative  branches  of the federal  govern- ment. Fundamental to any interpretation of the decline of confidence in an in- stitution is the basic question of how an institution can ever achieve con- fidence  in the first place. Functional social theory provides at least one in- terpretation. In this view, a society is comprised of a set of special purpose institutions  that  operate  to achieve  specialized  tasks  through  legitimate means. Any perceived disjuncture  between legitimate ends and legitimate means will result in a state of anomie of the system (Merton,  1968)  It is suggested,  therefore,  that  the most  general explanation  of the decline in confidence  in leadership is the pervasive belief  that  U.S. institutions are failing  to fulfill  their  functions  legitimately.  The activities that  comprise the social involvement index (equal opportunities, environment, etc.) may be regarded as attempts by the large corporation to regain legitimacy with the public. Table 4 reports the incidence of one or more items in the social involve- ment index among the Fortune 500 over the years 1971-1975. In 1971, 51.4 percent reported one or more activities. By 1975, this had increased to 85.7 percent. As the corporation increasingly has come under pressure from the pubhc  as well as the state,  areas  of criticism  have received  even greater TABLE  4 Trends  in Reporting  Social  Responsibility Disclosures  Among Fortune  500:  1971-1975a C a t e g o r i e s 1 9 7]  igj2  Percent 1973 Firms reporting social responsibility disclosures  Firms with no social responsibility  disclosures  A"'=  ~~  51.4  48.6  100.0  (465)  58 1  41.9  100.0  (492)  "Beresford  (1974a,  1975, 1976).

The  social  involvement  index  is  one measure of the corporate response of firms striving to regain legitimacy in American society. Issues and Priorities Table  5 aggregates  the  social  involvement  measures  by  content  area, with  the  content  areas  ranked  by  the  emphasis  indicated  by  the  1974 survey. The firms include those in the Fortune 500 in the years  1973 and 1974. The percentages by content area may be taken as an index of relative emphasis.  Environmental  matters  constitute  the  most  frequently  men- tioned area in the annual reports for both  1973 and  1974. In 1974, for ex- ample,  50.4  percent  of  the  annual  reports  indicated  concern  in  various forms  with this one issue. (It should be noted that environmental matters were  first  in  importance  for  both  periods  even  though  disclosures  by manufacturers  of equipment, a likely target of criticism on environmental effects,  were excluded for this one content  area in  1973.) All other issues have  distinctly  lower  emphasis.  In  1974,  equal  opportunities  (32.2 percent), personnel (29.4 percent), and  community  affairs  (25.5 percent) had essentially similar levels of emphasis. The rates of increase in the con- cern with equal opportunities and personnel (7.7 percent and 9.2 percent, respectively)  are  similar.  It  thus  is unclear  which  of  these  concerns  will receive emphasis second  to environmental matters in the near future.  In- volvement  in community affairs  (25.5 percent) does not  appear  to be in- creasing in relative emphasis (4.4 percent increase from  1973 to  1974) and thus should  maintain  its present  order  of  priority.  Safety  and  quality of products are last (10.5 percent). In sum, environmental matters appear to be of greatest concern to corporate thinking and should remain so in the near  future,  no  doubt  because  of  the  threat  of  political  repercussion. Nevertheless, the relative interest put on the various issue areas may be ex- pected to vary, depending on issues that emerge on the national scene.

Adam  Smith  argued:  "People  of  the  same  trade  seldom  meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy  against  the  public,  or  in  some  contrivance  to  raise  prices" UyJ/,  p.  128). Smith s system  is not  based  on the motivation  of  the en- trepreneur to be socially useful,  but rather on the existence of competitive forces in the system as a form of social control that directs the self-interest of the entrepreneur into socially useful channels. Therefore, because com- petition  prevents  long  run  excess profits  through  control  of  the  market long run profits  become an index of the extent to which the entrepreneur has been able to achieve efficiency  and thus minimize costs. Being socially responsible  thus  is  incompatible  with  this  model  of  entrepreneurial behavior  because  it may  not  result  in minimum  costs. The view that  the corporate  official  should  be  socially  responsible,  in  Friedman's  terms, thus  shows a fundamental  misconception of the character and nature of a  tree  economy  In  such  an  economy,  there  is one  and  only  one  social responsibility  of  business—to  use  its  resources  and  engage  in  activities designed  to  increase its profits  so long as it  stays within  the rules of  the game  (1962.  p.  133).  To  attempt  any  other  goal  "is  a  fundamentally subversive doctrine." If  one of  contemporary  capitalism's  leading theoretical  spokesmen re- jects social responsibility  as an obligation  of  the modern executive  what are  the  theoretical  arguments  for  corporate  social  involvement?  Argu- ments  supporting  corporate  social  involvement  are  based  on  an  open- systems model. An open-systems model involves explaining the behavior of  organizations  as  a  response  to  an  actual  or  anticipated  external  in- nuence.  The  open-systems  model  is  illustrated  in  political  history  by Bismarck  s social legislation in late nineteenth century Germany  In order to  stem  the  rising  influence  of  the  socialists.  Bismarck  supported  pro- gressive  social  legislation  in  an  attempt  to  reduce  pressure  for  more dramatic forms of political change. The progressive social legislation thus was  intended  to  "take  the  wind  out  of  the  sails"  of  the  socialists Although conservative in purpose, the policy appears to be liberal (as this term has been more recently used). This political mode of  thinking is no less applicable  to  the situation  in which  the corporation  at  present  finds Itself.  This  model  is illustrated  by the Narver  (1971) thesis on  corporate responsibilities  and  firm  welfare.  The  Narver  thesis  is  that  the  rational decision maker seeking to maximize the welfare of the firm in the long run must  adapt  to  the demands  being made on  the corporation  to maximize the present  market  value of  the stock  of  the  firm.  In order  to  maximize market value, it is necessary that the investor have confidence that the firm 512  Academy  of  Management  Journal  September will not  encounter  long  run  sanctions,  in  particular  from  governmental sources,  because  of  violations  regarding  pollution  and  other  social  in- volvetnent matters. The firm, in foregoing  short run profits,  thus is con- tributing to its long-run welfare. The difference,  therefore, between Fried- man and such advocates of enlightened social involvement as Narver may be a matter of short run versus long run time periods. Does  social  involvement  of  a  firm  decrease  profits  to  the  investor? Research  findings  on  the  relation  between  corporate  social  involvement and  profitability  are influenced  by the universe  of  corporations  studied, the measure  of  social involvement,  the measure of  profitability,  and  the time frame  of the study. The research results consequently are contradic- tory.  There is not conclusive evidence that  there is a clear linkage in any direction  between  corporate  social  activities  and  profitability.  Vance's (1975)  research,  for  example,  appears  convincing  that  corporate  social responsibility is inversely linked with profitability  in the short run. Vance analyzed the relation between reputational indexes of corporate social in- volvement  derived  from  ratings of 45 corporations  by corporate  staffers and  50  corporations  by  concerned  business  students  and  the  percent change in the price per share in 1974. Presented in scattergram form,  both measures  indicated  a  negative  relation  between  corporate  social involve- ment  and  change  in  share  prices,  although  the  inverse  relation  appears stronger  for  the corporate staffer  index than  for  the student index. There are  several  limitations  of  this  design,  however,  which  restrict  the usefulness  of the findings.  First, Vance reports the regression  coefficients but  does  not  report  the  correlation  coefficients.  The  strength  of  the negative association thus is not known. (In the case of the student scale, it does not  appear  to be strong.) Second,  1974 may not  be a representative year. Because 1974 was a disaster in the stock market, it is not appropriate to generalize from  that year alone. A longer time period is needed. Third, the change  in price per  share,  although  a  prime  component  of  the  total return to investors, does not consider  dividends. Dividends should be in- cluded  in  measuring  the  return  to  the  investor.  There  are  also  other measures of  profitability,  such as net income per unit  of  sales, assets, or stockholder's equity, that should be considered in analyzing this problem. Whereas Vance reported a negative association  between social involve- ment and profitability,  studies by Heinze (1976) and Bowman and  Haire (1975) report  a positive  association.  The Heinze  study  was based  on  the reputational scale of the concerned business students (also used by Vance), and sought to find the connection between this rating for 28 large corpora- tions and several measures of performance  for  1972. The design consisted of considering the measure of social involvement as the dependent variable and seven variables as independent  (sales growth,  net income per unit of sales, operating profit  per unit  of  sales, the current  ratio,  capitalization, net  income  per  unit  of  assets,  and  net  income  per  unit  of  net  worth). Heinze reported that the partial correlation between net income per unit of net worth and the social involvement measure (controlling for all the other 1979  Abbott  and Monsen  513 independent  variables) was .51. This finding  thus appears to support  the view  that  social  involvement  and  profitability  are  positively  correlated. There are two problems  in Heinze's  research  design,  however.  First,  the directionality of the causal model is inverted in terms of the social involve- ment  and  profitability  issue. The more appropriate  design is to  consider profitability  as the  dependent  variable  and  social  involvement  as the in- dependent  variable.  Although  the  zero-order  correlations  would  be  the same,  problems  of  interpretation  arise because  Heinze reported  only the statistically controlled  correlation  between the performance  measure and social involvement.  It would have been useful  had the zero-order correla- tion  matrix  also  been  reported.  Second,  the  universe  of  corporations  is highly restrictive. A sample of only 29 corporations does not provide con- fidence that the results have wide applicability. Bowman  and  Haire  used  the  proportion  of  lines  in  annual  reports discussing social involvement  matters as the index of  social involvement. They sought to validate this measure by comparing firms with a reputation for  social  involvement  and  a  comparison  group  selected  simply  on  the basis of size and industry. The high or premier groups scored  significantly higher on the Bowman-Haire  index than did the comparison group,  thus providing empirical support for the use of the annual report as an index of social  involvement.  Tiie  Bowman-Haire  sample  consisted  of  all  the American  food-processing  firms  in Moody's  Industrial Manual for 1973. which,  with  deletions,  resulted  in 82 firms. The measure  of  profitability was return on investment for  1969-1973 reported by Standard and  Poor's. Their findings provide support for the view that social responsibility does not  appear  to  threaten  the  profits  received  by  investors.  Those  firms reporting some discussion of corporate involvement (31 of 82 firms) had a mean return on investment of  14.3 percent, whereas those with no discus- sion  of  social  involvement  had  a  mean  return  of  9.1  percent.  The Bowman-Haire  study  of  social  involvement  appears  to  indicate that  it is not dysfunctional  for  a firm to be socially involved. Table 6 assembles available data on 450 corporations  of the  1974 For- tune 500 to test for the relation between the SID scale and the total return to  investors  for  1964-1974.  The  lower  involvement  firms  are  those  that reported less than three social involvement items in their annual reports of 1973 and  1974. The remaining firms, those reporting three or more items, constitute the high involvement firms. This classification results in 214 and 236 firms for  the two categories, respectively. The low involvement firms averaged 2.32 percent and the high involvement  firms  averaged 2.58 per- cent average return to investors for  1964-1974. The difference  of  .26 per- cent  obviously  indicates  that  there  appears  to  be  no  effect  of  social  in- volvement  for  this population  of  corporations.  These results are  further stratified  by  employment  size.  Those  companies  with  30.000  or  fewer employees  in  1974 are  considered  to  be in  the lower  category  and  those with  greater  than  30.000  employees  are  in  the  higher.  (This  is  approxi- mately  the  70th  percentile  for  the  1974 Fortune  500.)  Size  makes  little 514  Academy  of  Management  Journal  September Social  Involvement  Disclosures,  Employment  Size  and Average  Total Percentage Return to Investors from  1964 to 1974:1974 Fortune  500> TABLE  6 Average  Annual  Total  Percent Return  to  Investors (1964-1974) Mean 2.46 2.32 2.58 0.26 2.68 1.91 -0.77 2.65 2.73 0.08 N 450 214 236 318 132 174 144 40 92 Variable and  Groups Social  involvement  disclosures  (SID) Total Low  SID (0-2  social  disclosure  items:  1973-74) High  SID (3 +  social  disclosure  items:  1973-74) Difference:  high  minus  low Employment  size Low (30,000  and  under) High (above  30,000) Difference:  high  minus  low Employment  size  and  SID Low  employment  (30,000  and  under) Low  SID High  SID Difference:  high  minus  low High employment  (above  30,000) Low  SID High  SID Difference:  high  minus  low 'Data  reported  for 450 firms on  which return to investor data are available. 0.90 2.35 1.45 difference  in profitability.  The small firms averaged 2.68 percent, whereas the larger firms averaged  1.91 percent. When the effects  of size are taken into consideration,  social involvement appears to have only a very minor effect  upon  profitability  primarily  among  the  larger  firms.  Among  the smaller firms, for example, the difference  between high and low social in- volvement firms was  .08 percent.  Among the larger  firms,  however,  the less socially involved firms averaged .90 percent, whereas the more socially involved firms averaged 2.35 percent,  or a difference  of  1.45  percent be- tween  the  higher  and  lower  socially  involved  firms.  However,  this  dif- ference is also not substantial. Being socially involved does not appear to increase  investors'  total  rate  of  return.  Nor  does  it  appear  that  being socially involved is dysfunctional  for  the investor.  Perhaps it is the latter finding that  has greater  significance  for  decision  making  purposes,  par- ticularly given current political and social pressures. SUMMARY This  paper  has  attempted  to  develop  a  social  involvement  disclosure scale based on a content analysis of the annual reports of the Fortune 500. The resulting  scale and  data  were used  in three  ways: (1) to  analyze  the response of the Fortune 500 to criticism and governmental pressure, (2) to analyze the dimensions of such corporate response, and (3) to analyze the relationship  between  social involvement  and  corporate  profitability.  The self-reported  social  disclosure  method  of  measuring  corporate  social 1979  Abbott  and  Monsen  515 involvement, despite its own drawbacks, was found to have significant ad- vantages as a technique for  measuring corporate social responsibility and yielded generally meaningful  results when applied to the above questions.
