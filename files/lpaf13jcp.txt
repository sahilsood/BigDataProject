In the literature existing to date insufﬁcient attention has been given to small service companies in general, and to the restaurant sector in particular. Most of the studies conducted into environmental practices have thus focused on the industrial sector and on larger companies. This work is based on 374 surveys involving the managers of restaurants, using structural equation modeling to study the links between the dimensions studied. The ﬁndings of this study state that Quality Management Practices have a signiﬁcant direct impact on market success factors but not on companies’ proﬁt and loss statements. On the other hand, the study shows a signiﬁcant relationship between Environment Management Practices and ﬁnancial performance. The article suggests that being proactive on quality and environmental issues can bring small service companies a great number of beneﬁts that improve their competitiveness. Ó 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Introduction Quality and environment management practices are two of the key drivers for achieving market success and ﬁnancial performance in service industries (Karim et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2008; Alonso- Almeida et al., 2012). Most small companies, however, have not adopted a quality or environmental management system due to various barriers to doing so, such as cost, lack of training personnel or non-inclusion in the ﬁrm’s management strategy (Chan, 2011). Nevertheless, some quality and environmental practices have been adopted by numerous small companies. Such management practices take on particular importance when they are used as strategies to differentiate small service companies from their competitors (Rubio-Andrada et al., 2011; Alonso-Almeida and Rodriguez-Anton, 2011; Rodriguez-Antón et al., 2011), in a context in which econo- mies of scale do not apply and operational costs can have a suffo- cating effect on the company concerned. * Corresponding author.

Little research has, however, been undertaken to examine the combined impact of QMPs and EMPs on service industries. This is the general situation throughout the service sector with the exception of the hospitality industry, where some such studies have nevertheless been con- ducted (Alonso-Almeida et al., 2011, 2012; Pereira-Moliner et al., 2012). This lack of research becomes even more pronounced when the speciﬁc case of small service companies is examined in any sector apart from hospitality. Each industry develops different types of QMPs and EMPs and to different degrees of adoption, which will therefore result in different effects and results. For these reasons, in order to identify speciﬁc organizational behavior patterns, Lee (2009) pointed to the needed for quantitative research into a speciﬁc industry in relation to SMEs. In keeping with the J. Llach et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 44 (2013) 96e104 97 recommendations made by a number of authors (e.g. Kassinis and Soteriou, 2003; Hillary, 2004), the present study focuses on another speciﬁc branch of the tourist service industry in which there is a predominance of small or micro-companies, i.e. the restaurant sector. Moreover, the activities of companies operating in the restaurant sector revolve around two components, food production and service delivery, for which the adoption of both quality and environmental practices could be crucial for competi- tiveness. Thus, in relation to food production, the adoption of QMPs helps to save time and money by standardizing certain actions (Molina-Azorín et al., 2009; Alonso-Almeida et al., 2012), and EMPs reduce waste and water and energy consumption (Alonso-Almeida, 2012). In the case of service delivery, service quality is a key driver to achieving customer satisfaction and loyalty (Ribeiro, 2003; Ladhari et al., 2008; Hyun, 2010), while EMPs could attract new market segments (Hu et al., 2010; Jang et al., 2011). Moreover, another reason for restricting the survey to this subsector is that, according to Eurostat (2012), the food and beverages subsector accounted in 2011 for 85.4% of all companies in the EU-27’s accommodation and food services sector, and for 76.1% of the persons employed and 65.6% of the value added within it. This paper thus adds to previous research in a number of ways. First, it sheds light on the main QMPs adopted and the impact of such decisions on ﬁrm performance both directly and as modiﬁed by environmental management practices. Second, it increases the understanding of the environmental behavior of the service sector. Third, it provides an analysis of the effect of QMPs and EMPs on ﬁrm performance. In this study, ﬁrm performance is measured in terms of two aspects: companies’ market success factors (e.g., their image, their levels of customer and employee satisfaction), and their ﬁnancial performance. Fourth, it focuses on a service industry which has not previously been studied in this respect, thus providing useful empirical evidence for managerial practice in this industry. Finally, it provides new evidence about the importance of environmental practices to the service sector and their impact on companies’ organization and performance. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the theoretical arguments concerning the adoption of QMPs and EMPs and the relationship with ﬁrm performance. Section 3 describes the empirical design of this study. Section 4 presents a quantitative analysis, followed by Section 5, which presents the study’s ﬁndings. Section 6 concludes this paper with several conclusions drawn both from the research and from observed business practice. 2. Literature review 2.1. Impact of quality management on ﬁrm performance Previous research has also pointed to a certain number of critical drivers of quality management, such as management commitment, quality planning, quality improvement and quality control (Saraph et al., 1989). However, Zhao et al. (2004) stated that not all QMPs are equally effective in all organizations, especially in the case of small service ﬁrms, where QMPs such as management support, customer focus and process management, seemed to be more effective than detailed processes and complex systems. Given that QMPs could be considered as being unique to each company (Sousa and Aspinwall, 2010), small companies could choose certain QMPs and improve their performance even without adopting a speciﬁc standard management system or complex management practices (such as the examples shown in Appendix A). A debate exists about the extent of the impact of QMPs on ﬁrm performance as measured in ﬁnancial terms. Most research has pointed to a positive effect on ﬁnancial performance, due to operational improvements in the form of more effective control of processes and products that lead to savings by reducing repetitive tasks and reducing waste. This has beneﬁcial effects on the service provided, and can lead to improvements in the company’s ﬁnancial performance (Callan, 1992; Samson and Terziovski, 1999; Nield and Kozak, 1999; Forza and Flippini, 1998; Ahire and Dreyfus, 2000; Kaynak, 2003; Corbett et al., 2005; Terlaak and King, 2006; Rubio- Andrada et al., 2011; Rodriguez-Antón et al., 2011; Alonso-Almeida et al., 2012). However, some studies have asserted that this positive effect is limited in scope (Nair, 2006), mainly because the imple- mentation of QMPs inevitably involves speciﬁc costs in terms of training, planning and control management. Given that most previous research nevertheless concluded that QMPs may make companies more proﬁtable thanks to cost reductions and improved income due to an increasing number of customers and of repurchases, this hypothesis is proposed: H1a. Quality Management Practices (QMPs) are likely to have a direct positive impact on ﬁnancial performance in restaurants. In relation to restaurants, prior research has shown that the main market success factors are quality of service, customer satis- faction and strong image (Ribeiro, 2003; Chow et al., 2007; Noone et al., 2007; Ladhari et al., 2008; Azar, 2009; Hyun, 2010; Susskind, 2010; Black, 2012). Thus, Yong and Wilkinson (2003) found in relation to a restau- rant chain that they studied that key drivers in Quality Manage- ment Practices are strong management support, employee and supplier involvement, a culture of continuous improvement and control management. These QM practices contribute to maintain- ing competitiveness in both internal and external respects. With regard to the internal dimension, training in service quality and rewarding employees for suggestions made in the framework of continuous improvement schemes have the effect of increasing employee satisfaction (Yong and Wilkinson, 2003). Indeed, a positive atmosphere in which workers derive satisfaction from doing a good job (Azar, 2009) may produce a “virtuous cycle” effect that can encourage them to provide a better service (Walker and Salameh, 1996; Nield and Kozak, 1999; Testa and Sipe, 2006). In terms of the external dimension, good quality of service was found to have a strong relationship with customer satisfaction with the restaurants (Ribeiro, 2003; Chow et al., 2007; Ladhari et al., 2008; Hyun, 2010), with improved corporate image thanks to positive word-of-mouth, and with conﬁdence in the company (Hyun, 2010; Hyun and Kim, 2011). In accordance with the ﬁndings of prior research, the following hypothesis is proposed: H1b. Quality Management Practices (QMPs) are likely to have a direct positive impact on market success factors in restaurants. 2.2. Impact of environmental management on ﬁrm performance According to Blanco et al. (2009), a reduction in the consump- tion of resources or in the generation of waste is the ﬁrst incentive to implement environmental practices in the service sector. Companies usually adopt this type of environmental practice in order to achieve savings in their consumption costs, since they do not require signiﬁcant investment but may provide an immediate ﬁnancial beneﬁt (Zeng et al., 2010). The adoption of environmental practices also has an indirect impact on ﬁnancial performance. The reason for this is that the company concerned may have achieved savings in its consumption, reduced the cost of its operations and improved its overall oper- ating conditions (Vazquez et al., 2001; Fernandez-Viñé et al., 2010; Bagur et al., in press). Thus, Aragon-Correa et al. (2008), found a positive and direct relationship between the adoption of eco- efﬁcient practices and ﬁnancial performance in small industrial 98 J. Llach et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 44 (2013) 96e104 ﬁrms. In relation to services, some authors (e.g. Alvarez et al., 2001; Molina-Azorín et al., 2009) showed that hotels that were more environmentally proactive achieved a better ﬁnancial performance. There may well be a direct logical reason for this, given that Trung and Kumar (2005) found that in the Vietnamese hotel industry the highest consumption of water and energy was for guests’ rooms and for the kitchens, with the kitchens representing the greatest cause of waste. Therefore, when measures of control are taken and practiced this could have an immediate effect on invoices. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed: H2a. Environmental management practices (EMPs) are likely to have a direct positive impact on ﬁnancial performance in restaurants. When a company adopts and implements environmental prac- tices, it can improve its image, attract a new category of customer, further satisfy existing customers and thus ensure a better overall position for the company in the market (Hillary, 2004; Molina- Azorín et al., 2009; Alonso-Almeida and Rodriguez-Anton, 2011; Bagur et al., in press). Moreover, the company’s employees may experience greater satisfaction, in that its environmental commit- ment opens up a new channel of communication between staff and management that may well enhance staff morale and the general working atmosphere in the company (Kassinis and Soteriou, 2003; Cote et al., 2006). Employees’ commitment to environmental concerns may subsequently become increasingly identiﬁed with the company’s objectives (Enz and Siquaw, 1999; Kassinis and Soteriou, 2003). In accordance with prior research, the following hypothesis is thus proposed: H2b. Environmental management practices (EMPs) are likely to have a direct positive impact on market success factors in restaurants. 2.3. Strategies on the adoption of management practices and impact on ﬁrm performance As mentioned above, QMPs and EMPs help companies to be more competitive, which is why prior research found that companies of all sizes adopted ﬁrst QMPs and then EMPs (Karapetrovic and Willborn, 1998; Zeng et al., 2007; Karapetrovic and Casadesus, 2009; Rodriguez-Antón et al., 2012). In small companies the adoption strategy is the same (Douglas and Glen, 2000). The adoption of both QMPs and EMPs has been a growing concern in the tourism industry in recent years (Casadesus et al., 2010; Rodriguez-Antón et al., 2012). Moreover, Rodriguez-Anton et al. (2012) suggested that these practices add value to the busi- ness. Pereira-Moliner et al. (2012) reinforced this idea. These authors suggested that QMPs could provide an improvement in efﬁciency and effectiveness in the adoption of other organizational practices such as EMPs, because QMPs avoid duplications, reduce waste, simplify procedures, minimize unnecessary activities and improve communication and employee learning (Rodriguez-Antón and Alonso-Almeida, 2011). This reasoning is in line with previous research into integrated management systems (Karapetrovic and Willborn, 1998; Douglas and Glen, 2000; Zutshi and Sohal, 2005; Zeng et al., 2007; Salomone, 2008; Karapetrovic and Casadesus, 2009), which conﬁrmed that an optimization of resources is thus produced. Thus, QMPs could lead to the adoption of EMPs with less effort and fewer resources due to the competences achieved through the QMPs already developed (Pereira-Moliner et al., 2012). Therefore this hypothesis is proposed: H3. Adoption of QMPs impacts positively on the adoption of EMPs in restaurants. Today companies have to face a range of complex situations including stiff competition, a hostile economic environment, a decline in demand, ﬁnancial downturns and changes in consumers’ behavior (O’Connor and Frew, 2002; Kim et al., 2007; Briggs et al., 2007). So many challenges create a need for companies to develop distinctive features in order to maintain their position in the market (Russo and Fouts, 1997). Market success entails internal and external factors (Parsa et al., 2005). In the case of restaurants the main drivers are human capital (Yong and Wilkinson, 2003), customer satisfaction (Cohen, 1997; Susskind et al., 2007; Susskind, 2010; Black, 2012) and a strong company image (Susskind, 2002; Noone et al., 2007; Hyun and Kim, 2011). From an internal viewpoint, human resources are a major key to ensuring customer satisfaction, given that employees are crucial to delivering a high quality service. When customers perceive efforts to provide a quality service, this affects both their level of satis- faction and their purchase intentions (Yong and Wilkinson, 2003; Alonso-Almeida et al., 2012). Therefore, employees impact directly on their company’s ﬁnancial performance. From an external viewpoint, two factors are relevant. First, customer satisfaction is crucial to producing repurchase intentions, positive word-of-mouth and customer loyalty, and thus an improved ﬁnancial performance (Susskind et al., 2007: Alonso- Almeida, 2012). The second factor is company image. Consumers usually have conﬁdence in companies with a strong market image (i.e. strong brand references), even when they have never had direct contact with the company. Consumers are therefore more willing to purchase from this kind of company. In this way, both drivers have a direct impact on ﬁnancial performance. Thus, the following hypothesis is proposed: H4. Market success factors impacts positively on ﬁnancial performance in restaurants. In Fig. 1 below we present a proposed model based on the hypotheses postulated above. 3. Methodology 3.1. Population and sample The data used in the empirical section of the paper were ob- tained from a survey conducted in November and December 2010, in the region of Madrid, Spain, through personal interviews with the managers of 374 establishments in the food and beverage services subsector (division 56, NACE Rev.2). Eurostat (2012) deﬁnes the food and beverage services subsector as those ﬁrms that “provide complete meals or drinks ﬁt for immediate consumption, regardless of the type of facility providing the service.” The main reason for restricting the survey to this subsector is because, according to Eurostat (2012), the food and beverages subsector accounted in 2011 for 85.4% of all enterprises in the Fig. 1. Final model with hypothesis. J. Llach et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 44 (2013) 96e104 99 EU-27’s accommodation and food services sector, and for 76.1% of the persons employed and 65.6% of the value added within it. These ﬁgures take on particular importance in the Spanish context because, in terms of value added, Spain is the joint leader in the EU (together with Austria) in terms of specialization in these activities. Speciﬁcally, in Spain the food and beverage services subsector employed 969,196 persons in 261,320 ﬁrms in 2009, representing approximately 6% of the GDP in Spain (Spanish National Statistics Institute, 2012). The questionnaire was divided into three main sections: quality, environment and society. Moreover, there was a supplementary section asking for information about the company’s proﬁle. The sample is balanced between café-bars and restaurants. By typology, most of the ﬁrms were independent ﬁrms and, in terms of company history, more than half of the ﬁrms had been established for less than 10 years. See Table 1. 3.2. Measures ‘management Based on the above review of the literature and in the light of the hypotheses addressed, four constructs were explored in this study. The ﬁrst construct was Quality Management Practices (QMPs). The variables explored to measure quality management adoption were collaboration’, ‘provider collaboration’, ‘delivery service’, ‘objectives monitor’ and ‘quality culture’. The second factor, Environmental Management Practices (EMPs), was also measured in terms of six dimensions: ‘environmental ‘environ- mental marketing’, ‘environmental activities’, ‘long-term environ- mental strategic focus’ and ‘environmental savings and costs’. ‘environmental commitment’, ‘customer training’, initiatives’, Finally, in order to measure the impact on ﬁrms’ performance of the implementation of the above-mentioned practices, the present paper uses a valid and reliable scale developed by Camisón (1999) and used lately by other authors such as Pereira-Moliner et al. (2012). We adapted this scale and divided it into two dimensions: Market Success Factors (MSF) and Financial Performance (FP). MSF were measured in terms of ‘corporate image’, ‘customer satisfaction’ and ‘employee satisfaction’, while FP included measures of ‘proﬁts’, ‘activity’ and ‘occupation’. The deﬁnitions of the variables used to measure the four constructs, the variable codes and the references on which they were based are detailed in Appendix A. For measuring the dimensions of Quality and Environmental Management Practices and Market Success Factors, respondents were required to choose a value from a 7-point Likert scale (1 meaning “totally disagree” and 7 meaning “totally agree”). On the other hand, the variables used for measuring Financial Performance were ﬁve percentage intervals, following the scale proposed by Camisón (1999). Table 1 Descriptive statistics of the sample.

Results 4.1. Exploratory and conﬁrmatory factor analysis To validate the proposed model, a strictly-controlled process was followed in two stages: ﬁrstly, an exploratory factor analysis of the four constructs and, secondly, a conﬁrmatory factor analysis. In both stages the proposed model was assessed on the basis of statistical criteria. The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed for each factor to identify the latent dimensions deriving from the data used in the study. The scales were analyzed in accordance with the recommendations made by Hair et al. (1998) and Ladhari (2010). In all cases the items (i) load at more than .5 on a factor, (ii) do not load at more than .50 in two factors, and (iii) have an item to total correlation of more than .40. According to Table 2 the loads of the variables in the four factors are over .7. In addition, in order to conﬁrm the existence of linear depen- dence between the variables, the correlation matrix was subjected to the Bartlett’s test of sphericity. Moreover, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) index also conﬁrmed that factor analysis was likely to generate satisfactory results (Visauta, 1998). Next, the average variance extracted (AVE) for each factor was compared to the correlation with the other factors. It was thus possible to analyze the existence of discriminant validity (Chin, 1998). Table 3 shows that for the indicators used in the present study, on average, each construct was more closely related to its own dimensions than to the dimensions of other constructs. Finally, the conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was applied to the model to verify the factor structures that emerged from the EFA. The reliability of the resulting factors was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha. All the constructs had an alpha value of over .6, which exceeded Malhotra’s (2004) and Nunnaly’s (1978) minimum internal consistency criterion. Moreover, internal consistency was tested with the composite reliability indicator. In all cases the results conﬁrmed the adequacy of the constructs because all items excee- ded the minimum criterion of .6 for composed reliability coefﬁcient. Next, within the CFA, structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed using the maximum likelihood method and EQS soft- ware to test the model. In accordance with Table 4, an overall conclusion about the ﬁt of the model can be obtained by considering these indices simulta- neously, as recommended by Schermelleh-Engel et al. (2003), and by obtaining at least three ﬁt statistics indicating an acceptable ﬁt. In the case of the Chi-square test divided by degrees of freedom, the values are smaller than 3, as Carmines (1981) proposes. Related to the model goodness-of-ﬁt index (GFI) and the adjusted goodness-of-ﬁt (AGFI), both values are greater than .8, which indicates an acceptable model ﬁt (Byrne, 1994; Hu and Bentler, 1999). Moreover, the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) has a value of .06 or less, which indicates a good ﬁt model, as Hu and Bentler (1999) also indicate. Finally, the comparative ﬁt index (CFI) value is, in all cases, higher than .90, also indicating a better model ﬁt (Hu and Bentler, 1999). Therefore, because more than three statistics in the model are over the recommended values, we can afﬁrm that these measures of overall ﬁtness reﬂect the explanatory power of the proposed model. 4.2. Final model The standardized solution of the causal model is presented in Fig. 2. The initial dimensionality proposal was conﬁrmed after a second-order conﬁrmatory analysis with EQS 6.1 software (Byrne, 1994). 100 J.

Mediation effect of EMP The mediation effect was measured using the methodology proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) and later by other authors in different settings (e.g. Bontis et al., 2007; Petnji et al., 2011; or, more recently, Kong et al., 2012). Three control variables were included in the model: classiﬁcation, typology and age, which were described in Table 1. Classiﬁcation is a dichotomous variable (0 ¼ casual restaurant; 1 ¼ restaurant), typology is another dichotomous variable (0 ¼ independent ﬁrm; 1 ¼ subsidiary ﬁrm) and age is a continuous variable. Baron and Kenny’s (1986) methodology proposes three regres- sion models: 1. Regressing the mediator on the independent variable 2. Regressing the dependent variable on the independent variable 3. Regressing the dependent variable on both the independent variable and the mediator Next, two sets of regression analysis were performed (Tables 5a and b) following Baron and Kenny’s (1986) methodology to test the mediation effect of EMP between QMP and ﬁrms’ performance. In the ﬁrst set of regression analysis (Table 5a), we studied the mediation role of EMP between QMP and FP. Therefore, we considered QMP to be the independent variable, FP the dependent variable, and EMP the mediator variable. Table 5a shows that (i) regression 1a conﬁrms that the inde- pendent variable affects the mediator, (ii) regression 2a conﬁrms that the independent variable does not affect the dependent vari- able, and (iii) regression 3a conﬁrms that the mediation variable effects on the dependent variable and the independent variable become insigniﬁcant when the mediation variable is introduced in the model. However, the conclusions raised from these results may need to be taken with caution due to the low adjusted R2 value. In the second set of regression analysis (Table 5b), we study the mediation role of EMP between QMP and ﬁrms’ performance, but now in terms of Market Success Factors. Table 5b shows that (i) regression 1 conﬁrms that the inde- pendent variable affects the mediator as it was presented in Table 5a, (ii) regression 2 conﬁrms that the independent variable also affects the dependent variable, and (iii) regression 3 shows that the independent variable remains signiﬁcant, although its Table 3 Correlation matrix and discriminant validity.

Employees are directly involved in the implementation of QMPs, and for this reason it is essential that they should be committed and motivated to operating internal processes, so that the customer can perceive and value highly the service received, resulting in a positive buzz of the kind that can be considered as the world’s cheapest marketing tool (Yong and Wilkinson, 2003). In hospitality, previous authors shown that QMPs have a positive effect on market success and stakeholders satisfaction factors (Alonso-Almeida et al., 2012; Pereira-Moliner et al., 2012). In this regard, Hypothesis H1b is conﬁrmed. However, as previous authors have highlighted (e.g. Chan, 2011), this then provides proof that there is not always a direct effect between the implementation of quality practices and ﬁnancial performance. It is clear that the introduction of QMPs into a company impacts positively on its image and other key factors for its survival, although there are signiﬁcant barriers that often make their implementation expensive. The costs of staff training, and the preparation of the organization to make it capable when imple- menting quality methodologies, make the proﬁtability of QMPs certainly doubtful in many cases. This fact is conﬁrmed in this present study. Contrary to the study of hospitality conducted by Pereira-Moliner et al. (2012) in which a positive relation was found between QMPs and EMPs, in the analyzed sample, the negative impact of the implementation of QMPs (high costs) is greater than the positive impact represented by the direct increase in income. For this reason, Hypothesis H1a is rejected. In reference to Environmental Management Practices (EMPs), H2a is conﬁrmed and H2b is rejected. EMPs have direct and positive impact on FP (ﬁnancial performance) but not on Market Success Factors (MSF). These results are similar in Pereira-Moliner et al. (2012). These authors found that EMPs have a positive effect on ﬁnancial performance but not on stakeholder satisfaction in hotels. Our ﬁndings partially corroborate previous research. On the one hand the adoption of EMPs, even though they were considered “basic” (Alvarez-Gil et al., 2001; Molina-Azorín et al., 2009; Bagur et al., in press), impacts directly and immediately on operational costs. Bagur et al. (in press) pointed to a number of beneﬁts for small service companies. First, EMPs constitute an efﬁcient method of cost reduction, since the company reduces its costs with no impact on sales. The customer does not perceive this cost reduction as a loss of value in terms of the service received. Second, it is a form of cost reduction that reduces the company’s ﬁxed costs. This type of reduction not only improves its economic performance but also improves its ability to remain viable in the market during times of crisis. A reduction of ﬁxed costs could result in companies becoming more ﬂexible and less volatile, since they need to sell less to cover their costs. Finally, this ﬁnding highlights the importance of environmental policy adoption as a global strategy in addition to marketing that will enable companies to achieve a competitive advantage based on customer focus independently of company size. On the other hand, unlike previous research (Alvarez-Gil, 2001; Aragon-Correa et al., 2008; Molina-Azorín et al., 2009) this study has not found any direct impacts between EMPs and MSF. One possible explanation could be that, unlike QMPs, which improve the company image, the implementation of EMPs cannot inﬂuence the competitiveness of the company by improving its “green image” and enabling it to attract a new category of customers for the restaurant, when most of the practices adopted are internal and, therefore, the costumers could not be aware of their use. In the case of the relationship between QMPs and EMPs, as demonstrated in previous research (Zutshi and Sohal, 2005; Zeng et al., 2007; Salomone, 2008; Karapetrovic and Casadesus, 2009; Rodriguez- Anton et al., 2012; Pereira-Moliner et al., 2012) and corroborated by this study, it seems clear that the adoption of QMPs facilitates Fig. 2. Structural model. inﬂuence on the dependent variable decreases, and the mediator does not affect the dependent variable. In this second set of regression analysis the models adjust much more than the models presented in Table 5a. 5. Discussion of the results The results of the statistical analysis validate most of the model proposed in the previous sections. As stated below, hypotheses are contrasted one by one and ﬁndings are explained. As demonstrated by the previous research, the quality of service, customer satisfaction and external image are the most important success factors in restaurants. In this sense, the model conﬁrms a high relationship between these variables and QMPs. It seems clear that customer relationships should be a priority not only for large businesses but also for small ones, whose limited resources make the QMPs a great tool to differentiate themselves from their competitors in the market (Russo and Fouts, 1997; Parsa et al., 2005). Small businesses operating in limited markets with high degrees of competition, as is the case in the sector being studied, Table 5 a: Regression analysis of QMP and EMP on FP. b: Regression analysis of QMP and EMP on MSF.

Moreover, this ﬁnding also points to the sequence of the implementation process, based ﬁrst on QMPs and second on EMPs. Service companies prefer to focus on adding value activities for customers with high visibility, and only later optimizing internal operations. Another explanation could be some of the entry barriers to the adoption of either of these management practices. Thus the adoption of EMPs could be made difﬁcult by a lack of training and the cost of implementation. In this sense, the experience of already having established QMPs provides a valuable learning process for the organization facilitating the adoption of EMPs, thus creating synergies between both practices. For this reason Hypothesis H3 is conﬁrmed. The relationship between MSF and FP is very clearly conﬁrmed. The key factors described as being necessary for organizations to be able to ensure their survival in the long term (i.e. through improving their competitiveness) have a direct and positive impact on FP, as was described in hypotheses H4. The factors mentioned are either internal (operational cost reduction and efﬁciency improvement) or external (external image enhancement, improved positioning). While it has not shown a direct relationship between QMPs and FP, this study demon- strates that the implementation through mediating factors of quality management techniques is ﬁnancially positive for the organization. Finally, the “image enhancement” and “internal process improvement” effects which occur in any organization when the culture of quality is introduced are subjects which have come to be studied in depth. There is virtual unanimity, then, that QMPs improve competitiveness and the ability of a company to survive in times of crisis, as many studies have indicated. However, the issue of whether the improvement of competitiveness and image actu- ally improves the ﬁnancial performance of the company generates less consensus. In this regard, this study conﬁrms that improvements in competitiveness which involve the implantation of QMPs have a real impact on the ﬁnances of companies, and also facilitate the imple- mentation of EMPs, which also have a direct impact on results. This impact is achieved through positioning the organization externally e in terms of image and customer satisfaction e or by internally improving the competitiveness of the company e in terms of process improvement, human resources and reduced operating costs. 6. Conclusions Hitherto, business practices related to quality and the environ- ment have already been identiﬁed as two key drivers for achieving market success and ﬁnancial performance in service ﬁrms. However, previous studies focused on service companies in general, with the exception of hospitality, and hence, little research has been undertaken in relation to small companies. Therefore, the conclusions drawn from the study of the restaurant industry, where there is predominance of small and micro-enterprises, may be especially relevant both for academics and for practitioners. With regard to the academic aspect, three conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, it can be stated that Quality Management Practices have a signiﬁcant direct impact on Market Success Factors. Therefore, developing a culture based on the involvement of managers, working with the client and suppliers to improve the product, identifying improvements in the service delivery process, monitoring compliance with objectives and where appropriate, the correction of any deviation from them, and the implementation of a culture of continuous improvement has a signiﬁcant direct impact on the corporate image of the business, and on customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction. It is particularly crucial to achieve employee involvement and commitment as a result of a high degree of contact between customers and employees (Yong and Wilkinson, 2003; Rodriguez- Anton and Alonso-Almeida, 2011). In contrast, the study did not show that there is a signiﬁcant direct relationship between QMPs and FP. Second, following the above argument, the study shows that there is a signiﬁcant relationship between EMPs and FP but not between EMPs and MSF. Therefore, restaurants that implement an active environmental policy in the form of initiatives such as establishing a long-term environmental strategy and quantifying the savings and costs of their environmental policies, subsequently experience a direct improvement in their operating proﬁts in terms of ﬁnancial performance. To optimize this strategy externally the small service company may thus adopt an environmentally responsible posture that helps to create a positive public image and turn it into an example for other companies in the sector (Enz and Siquaw, 1999; Hillary, 2004; Fernandez-Viñé et al., 2010). Third, the study shows that although it is only environmental practices that have a direct effect on proﬁts, economic activity and occupation, any quality practices that a restaurant implements may actually have an indirect effect on these variables. In this regard, it is shown from the results that, although it was only EMPs that had a direct signiﬁcant effect on FP, EMPs were signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by QMPs. Thus, according to these ﬁndings, it can be concluded that QMPs are still important for achieving FP, but that this importance is exercised in an indirect way, mediated by the implementation of EMPs. Restaurants could achieve the best performance by jointly adopting QMPs and EMPs in a proactive manner. Three conclusions can be drawn from the study that may be of direct interest to professional practitioners working in the sector. First, it can be concluded that the signiﬁcant positive relationship between QMPs and MSF should lead restaurant managers to consider implementing quality policies. If these businesses could manage to train their employees to apply quality practices at an organizational level, they would experience an improvement in their operational processes leading to customer satisfaction with the product they offer in their establishment. However, such practices, in the case of restaurants, do not have a direct positive effect on operational proﬁts in this type of micro-company. The limited degree of mutual inﬂuence between these two variables is explained by the fact that implementing quality policies can be expensive, especially in micro-enterprises with very limited resources. An increase in costs due to staff training or the intro- duction of a continuous improvement policy in the organization could thus have a negative effect on the business’s proﬁtability. Second, the fact that the study shows a direct relationship between EMPs and FP should raise awareness among restaurant managers of the importance of implementing an environmental policy in their businesses in order to improve their proﬁts. In any case, since the environmental practices are likely to be imple- mented as an internal process, they are less visible to external customers. Their impact on the MSF is less signiﬁcant than their impact on competitiveness due to the implementation of quality practices. Third, the direct mutual inter-effects operating between QMPs and EMPs should lead restaurant managers to focus on the imple- mentation of such practices in order to take full advantage of their beneﬁts. The study shows that environmental practices in restau- rants are inﬂuenced by the implementation of quality practices, and that environmental practices have a direct inﬂuence on prof- itability. Additionally, the relationship with MSF shows the restaurant’s potential, and its ﬁnancial results will be improved by the indirect relation referred to above, since it is clear that, ulti- mately, the balance sheet will be positively inﬂuenced by factors such as customer satisfaction and enhanced brand image. This study opens the door to other issues to consider in future research, such as, for example, whether these results are valid in other sectors, other small businesses or other regions; and the J. Llach et al. / Journal of Cleaner Production 44 (2013) 96e104 103 practical viability of developing corporate social responsibility prac- tices within the variables that have been studied during the research. Finally, this study is subject to certain limitations, one of which is related to most surveys of this type: the ﬁeld work was per- formed in a speciﬁc geographical region, and the study results may be difﬁcult to extrapolate to other countries. Additionally, as only restaurants have been surveyed, the conclusions may be difﬁcult to apply in other sectors. Nevertheless, as the survey can justiﬁably be considered as being representative of the region analyzed, this may be indicative of the status of this sub-industry in the whole of Spain.
