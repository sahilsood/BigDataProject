Siegel We assess the role of human capital in the growth and development of new technology- based ventures, based on longitudinal data from 198 high-tech ventures. Our empirical results imply that there is a strong relationship between team experience and strategy. Although there is a weak direct link between team experience and venture performance, the ﬁndings strongly suggest that the ﬁt between strategy and team experience is a key deter- minant of the long-term performance of high-tech entrepreneurial ventures. For small, technology-based new ventures, the team’s technological experience appears to be the most important determinant of the success of a differentiation strategy. Introduction Numerous scholars in strategic management have assessed the relationship between the characteristics of managers and the performance of large ﬁrms (e.g., Bantel & Jackson, 1989; Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1990, 1996; Gupta, 1984, 1988; Hambrick, 1982, 1994; Hambrick, Cho, & Chen, 1996; Hambrick & Mason, 1984; Norburn & Birley, 1988; Szilagyi & Schweiger, 1984; Wiersema & Bantel, 1992). Much of this research is grounded in Upper Echelons theory (Hambrick & Mason, 1984), which asserts that organizational outcomes (strategic choices and performance levels) are partially determined by key attributes of top managers. Characteristics such as job tenure, age, education, or functional expertise are conjectured to be determinants of strategy and performance because they inﬂuence decision making. Furthermore, they may constitute critical intangible resources, which can be valuable to the ﬁrm.

The analysis of individual managers, especially those employed by entrepreneurial ﬁrms, can also be related to the economic theory of human capital (Becker, 1964; Rosen, 1987). This theory begins with the realization that wage differentials are due to differences in productivity. Labor economists used this theory to reach a fundamental conclusion: labor is heterogeneous and an individual’s human capital consists of his/her productive skills and technical knowledge and any other skills that might be useful to the ﬁrm (i.e., the full set of characteristics that may enhance his or her salary). Thus, a worker’s or manager’s compensation can be viewed as return to investment in human capital. Human capital is likely to be particularly important in the context of technological entrepreneurship. A signiﬁcant percentage of the value of technology-based new ventures is likely to be determined by the quality of the company’s employees, especially the top management team (henceforth, TMT). Furthermore, several authors (Bartel & Lichtenberg, 1987, 1990; Siegel, 1999; Siegel, Waldman, & Youngdahl, 1997; Link & Siegel, 2007) have shown that employees with more human capital (i.e., more education and experience) help ﬁrms implement new technologies more effectively. Many scholars in entrepreneurship have focused on examining relationships between salient characteristics of entrepreneurs and the performance of new ventures (e.g., Birley & Norburn, 1987; Cooper, 1981; Davidsson & Honig, 2003; Ensley & Amason, 1999; Ensley, Pearson, & Amason, 2002; Feeser & Willard, 1990; Hornaday & Aboud, 1971; Palmer, 1971; Ucbasaran, Lockett, Wright, & Westhead, 2003; Vanaelst et al., 2006; Vesper, 1990). These individual attributes can be viewed as aspects of the entrepreneur’s human capital. Unfortunately, there has been little consistency and no consensus among the ﬁndings of this research. These results have led some entrepreneurship scholars to conclude that characteristics of entrepreneurs are not important and even to advocate abandoning this line of inquiry (e.g., Gartner, 1988). Such ﬁndings and conclusions are puzzling because we might expect that the link between managerial characteristics and performance is stronger for new ventures (Shrader, 2001), given their simpler structures, lack of organi- zational inertia, and less complex strategies. Consequently, entrepreneurship scholars continue to examine the role of human capital among individual entrepreneurs (e.g., Davidsson & Honig, 2003). Recently, entrepreneurship scholars have begun to study the importance of entrepre- neurial teams, due to the recognition that high potential, high growth ﬁrms are typically launched and grown by teams of entrepreneurs, not individuals. An entrepreneurial team is deﬁned as a group working together to launch a new business venture. Such a group often resembles the TMT of a more established ﬁrm in that it might include several people with diverse experience and skills in a variety of functional areas. Recent studies have focused on the process of team formation (Clarysse & Moray, 2004; Kamm & Nurick, 1993; Ucbasaran et al., 2003; Vanaelst et al., 2006), team heterogeneity (e.g., Amason, Shrader, & Tompson, 2006; Chowdhury, 2005; Ensley & Amason, 1999; Ensley, Carland, & Carland, 1998), or team cohesion and conﬂict (Ensley et al., 2002). However, there is a paucity of research on entrepreneurial teams, strategy, and venture performance (Daily, McDougall, Covin, & Dalton, 2002). Three important differences distinguish the literatures cited above. Strategic manage- ment studies have been grounded in upper echelon theory, whereas studies of entrepre- neurs’ experience have often lacked theoretical grounding. Strategy scholars have examined management teams, while entrepreneurship scholars have mostly concentrated 894 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE on individual founders. Finally, strategy scholars have linked managerial characteristics to performance by considering the interaction of these characteristics with the competitive strategies of ﬁrms, whereas entrepreneurship scholars have failed to examine these link- ages. Therefore, this study will draw upon the upper echelon theory of strategic manage- ment to address the following research questions: 1. Are entrepreneurial team characteristics related to the competitive strategies of technology-based new ventures? 2. Is the ﬁt between venture team characteristics and strategy related the ﬁnancial per- formance of technology-based new ventures? Literature Review and Hypotheses In the entrepreneurship literature, it is well established that the strategies pursued by new ventures have a direct and strong inﬂuence on the ﬁnancial performance of those ﬁrms (e.g., Lambkin, 1988; McDougall, 1987; Sandberg & Hofer, 1987). For example, new ventures offering differentiated products to niche markets often outperform other new ventures. In the strategy literature, strong links have also been found between the characteristics of TMTs and strategies pursued by established ﬁrms (e.g., Bantel & Jackson, 1989; Hambrick, 1982; Wiersema & Bantel, 1992). However, these insights have not yet been applied to research on new ventures. While these studies imply that managers and strategies each directly inﬂuenced performance, another body of literature suggests that performance was best explained by the ﬁt between managerial characteristics and strat- egies (e.g., Litschert & Ramaswami, 1991; Norburn & Birley, 1988; Pettigrew, 1992). In other words, superior performance results when managers have backgrounds and experi- ence that are especially relevant to the particular strategies of the ﬁrm. For example, a ﬁrm pursuing a strategy of radical innovation might require younger, more educated managers (who might be willing to assume more risk), as well as executives with signiﬁcant technical and marketing experience, which would be useful in product development and commercialization. A recent paper (Amason et al., 2006) reports that among new ventures, neither innovation nor entrepreneurial team heterogeneity was directly related to performance. However, the authors found that the interaction of innovation and team heterogeneity had a profound inﬂuence on multiple measures of ﬁrm performance. Such results provide initial evidence that among new ventures, ﬁt between team characteristics, and strategy inﬂuences performance. The Amason et al. study examined heterogeneity, in general, rather than the speciﬁc characteristics of team members proposed here. Furthermore, it examined only innovation, not a broad range of strategic alternatives. Given the theoretic reasoning outlined above, it is logical to conjecture that among high-performing new ventures there should be a link between the backgrounds of team members and the competitive strategies of these ﬁrms. Furthermore, based on theory and the consensus of the entrepreneurship literature, we expect to observe a positive connec- tion between strategy-experience ﬁt and performance, but not a direct link between team experience and performance. The theory of human capital also provides support for the view that managerial characteristics such as experience should inﬂuence strategic choice and ﬁrm performance among technology-based new ventures. That is, human capital theory suggests that an experienced entrepreneurial team should be more productive than a less experienced team, November, 2007 895 since experience is a valuable asset that has been shown to increase worker productivity and the economic value of the ﬁrm, as well as managerial compensation. Experience also allows managers to make more informed strategic choices. More speciﬁcally, these theories lead us to believe that specialized experience in functional areas relates to the strategies pursued by a new venture. Functional experience represents a resource that can enhance a ﬁrm’s ability to formulate and implement speciﬁc strategies. For example, it would be logical to assume that a ﬁrm pursuing a strategy of differentiation based on innovative new product introductions might beneﬁt from the human capital developed though years of experience in technical jobs. Such experience would provide insights into technical advances that might enhance product features. Furthermore, it has been well established that differentiation is achieved as much or more through marketing as it is through actual product attributes (Porter, 1980, 1985). Conse- quently, it would also be logical to conclude that additional experience in marketing would help to differentiate a ﬁrm’s products in the minds of buyers. Thus, one would theorize that, regardless of causation, greater emphasis on innovation-based differentiation should be related to greater technical and marketing experience. Causation could, of course, go in either direction in that greater experience in these areas could lead to a greater emphasis on differentiation, or a team attempting to pursue a strategy of differentiation might intentionally recruit team members with appropriate experience in both areas. Similar reasoning would also lead us to believe that a venture pursing a cost leadership strategy would be concerned about the functional area of ﬁnancial management and thus, might beneﬁt from greater depth of experience in the ﬁnance. In a similar vein, a venture pursuing international markets should beneﬁt from human capital acquired through increased international experience among its team members. However, given the lack of empirical evidence and the somewhat exploratory nature of our research, instead of numerous hypotheses regarding speciﬁc strategies and experience, we will examine general hypotheses that will allow us to explore a number of strategic issues and several types of experience among entrepreneurial teams. Thus, we have three hypotheses: Hypothesis 1: Among high-performing, technology-based ventures, the experience of the entrepreneurial team will be signiﬁcantly related to the strategies pursued by those ﬁrms. Hypothesis 2: Entrepreneurial team experience will not be directly related to the performance of technology-based new ventures. Hypothesis 3: The ﬁt between strategy and entrepreneurial team experience will be signiﬁcantly related to the performance of technology-based new ventures. Methodology Sample Our empirical analysis is based on a large sample of publicly traded, technology- based new ventures. These are deﬁned as ﬁrms that were less than 6 years old and involved in industries deﬁned by the National Science Foundation as high-technology sectors. The wealth of information available on initial public offerings (IPOs) allowed consistent data to be collected from a number of different sources over a relatively extended time period. In this case, we collected performance data for 10 years after the time in which other variables were measured. A sample of 198 publicly traded new ventures was identiﬁed 896 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE based on investigating and screening an exhaustive list of ﬁrms issuing IPOs over a 6-year time period from 1988 to 1993. This time period allowed us to examine a large sample of IPO ﬁrms prior to the irrationality introduced by Internet bubble of the mid and late 1990s. It also enables us to assess long-term performance. Performance data were collected up through the year 2003. Data Founding team data (total years of previous experience in the industry, in functional areas, and in prior start-ups among the management team at the time of IPO) were collected from IPO prospectuses. The prospectus is a document that all ﬁrms ﬁle with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) when issuing public stock. This document contains a wealth of information regarding the ﬁrm’s management, history, risks, and intended strategy. The existence of strict regulations governing the content of the prospectus, as well as the intense use of consultants in preparing these documents, results in highly consistent reporting practices. As a result, prospectus data are considered reliable (Marino, Castaldi, & Dollinger, 1989) and there is a long tradition of using such information in strategy research (Beatty & Zajac, 1994; Filatotchev & Bishop, 2002; Rumelt, 1974) and, more recently, in entrepreneurship research (Robinson & McDougall, 1998, 2001). While prospectuses do not include resumes of each team member, the purpose of the document is to sell stock. Therefore, it is assumed that all relevant information will be included. Michael Porter’s typology of generic business strategies (differentiation, low-cost leadership, and focus) and other dimensions of strategy (i.e., strategic aggressiveness and internationalization) were examined based on data in IPO prospectuses. In order to derive these ﬁrm-level measures of strategic choice, two researchers independently read and evaluated prospectuses and coded strategy data using uniform, pretested coding sheets, which have already been developed and used in previous studies (Amason et al., 2006; Kunkel, 1991; McGee & Dowling, 1994; Robinson, 1995; Shrader, 1996; Shrader, Oviatt, & McDougall, 2000). Researchers indicated whether or not each strategy was emphasized in the prospectus as being a competitive weapon of the ﬁrm. Inter-rater reliability exceeded .82 for each measure. Multiple item scales based on precedents within the literature were used to calculate each variable. Industry data, which were included as controls in this study, were collected entirely from archival sources. Performance data were collected from the COMPUSTAT database and averaged for a period of 10 years after each venture’s IPO. The speciﬁc items used to calculate each variable and the Cronbach alpha associated with each were as follows: Generic Low Cost was calculated as the mean of the venture’s emphasis on low cost, economies of scale and commodity products as strategic weapons (alpha = .72). Generic Differentiation was calculated as the venture’s emphasis on differ- entiation, new product development and innovation as strategic weapons (alpha = .82). Strategic Aggressiveness was calculated based on the venture’s growth objective, industry leadership objective, market share objective, and entry position (alpha = .72). Strategic Breadth was measured based on the numbers of market segments targeted, product lines, and customers served (alpha = .74). International Intensity was calculated based on foreign sales in year 6 of the ﬁrm’s existence, foreign direct investment in year 6, and foreign assets in year 6 (alpha = .94). For a ﬁner-grained analysis of the differentiation strategy, innovation-based differentiation was measured by a single variable indicating the degree to which the ﬁrm emphasized innovation-based differentiation as a strategic weapon. Likewise, marketing-based differentiation was computed by a single variable indicating the degree to which the ﬁrm emphasized marketing-based differentiation as a strategic weapon. All experience variables were measured as the total years of experience November, 2007 897 possessed by the entire entrepreneurial team at year 6. Proﬁtability was calculated as the average return on investment (ROI), return on sales (ROS), and return on assets (ROA) of each venture during the time period of the study. Sales Growth was computed as the average annual growth rate during the period of interest. Control variables included ﬁrm age at the time strategy variables were measured. Industry controls included rate of industry growth during the time period of the study, degree of global integration, technological intensity, and competitive intensity. Global Integration was computed using the percentage of intraﬁrm to total foreign trade per standard industrial classiﬁcation (SIC). (Kobrin, 1991) Technological Intensity was based on average patenting activity over 5 years preceding IPO. Competitive Intensity was calculated using the average absolute value of market share change of the top 8 ﬁrms per 4-digit SIC times the total number of ﬁrms in the top 8 during the same period (Sharfman & Dean, 1991). Industry growth was measured as the average annual growth in sales for the industry during the 5 years prior to IPO. Analytical Techniques An analysis of the correlation matrix provides a useful indication of the strength of the experience-strategy ﬁt. In addition, we estimated two types of regressions. The ﬁrst set of regressions allow us to identify the determinants of strategic choices made by new ventures, i.e., emphasis on low-cost, emphasis on differentiation, strategic breadth, strategic aggressiveness, and international intensity. We also examine the relationship between experience and measures of venture strategy. A second set of regressions consti- tutes an attempt to explain two indicators of ﬁrm performance: proﬁtability and sales growth. Our initial results indicate that technical and marketing experience are both positively and signiﬁcantly related to the differentiation strategy. Since these results are consistent with a conceptualization of differentiation as being both innovation-based and marketing-based, we decided to also conduct tests with this ﬁner-grained operationaliza- tion of differentiation and examined factors related to the ﬁrms’ emphasis on marketing and/or innovation in addition to other strategy variables. Results Our empirical results are presented in Tables 1–3. These ﬁndings provide striking evidence of a clear and consistent ﬁt between team backgrounds and competitive strategy among this sample of high-performing new ventures. As has been well established in the literature, the results indicate that industry characteristics and venture strategy are signiﬁcantly related to venture performance. Also, consistent with the literature, there appears to be a tenuous link between performance and team characteristics. However, we found strong evidence that the ﬁt between strategy and experience is indeed signiﬁcantly related to new venture performance—even in the long-run. Table 1 presents correlations among all the variables used in the study. These corre- lations provide initial indications of strong relationships between team experience and competitive strategy. All variance inﬂation factor (VIF) scores were less than 1.0. Thus, no evidence of multi-collinearity was indicated. Table 2 presents the results of regression analyses using continuous measures of strategy as dependent variables and team experience as independent variables. Each model was signiﬁcant and the econometric results are relatively straightforward and easy to 898 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE 4 2 3 2 2 2 1 2 0 2 9 1 8 1 7 1 6 1 5 1 4 1 3 1 2 1 1 1 0 1 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 s e l b a i r a V x i r t a M n o i t a l e r r o C 1 e l b a T 2 3 . 7 2 . 7 0 . 2 2 . 9 0 . -

M, mean experience. interpret. These ﬁnding strongly support hypothesis 1. Our empirical tests indicate that team industry experience is positively related to the pursuit of the generic low-cost strategy, whereas technical experience was negatively related to this strategy. Technical experience and marketing experience are positively related to the generic differentiation strategy. Note that differentiation can be achieved via tangible product differences and/or intensive marketing efforts. We also know that some ﬁrms in our sample emphasized innovation-based differentiation, while others focused on marketing-based differentiation. Given this stylized fact, and also because marketing experience and technical experience were found to be signiﬁcantly related to generic differentiation, we decided to take a ﬁner-grained look at this particular strategy to see if there would be any differences between those ﬁrms that emphasized innovation-based differentiation versus those that emphasized marketing-based differentiation. As expected, marketing experience was highly signiﬁcantly related to the pursuit of marketing-based differentiation, whereas technical experience had a weaker relationship with this competitive strategy. Not surprisingly, a strategy that emphasized November, 2007 901 innovation-based differentiation was positively related to technical experience. Teams that emphasized strategic breadth had signiﬁcantly more start-up experience, but ﬁnance experience was negatively related to this strategy. Strategic aggressiveness was positively related to industry experience and technical experience but negatively related to ﬁnance experience. Finally, prior industry experience and prior start-up experience were both positively related to internationalization. Surprisingly, however, international experience was not signiﬁcantly related to international intensity. However, within this sample, nearly all the venture teams had a signiﬁcant amount of international experience among them, especially those ventures with any level of international sales. The fact that nearly all the ventures had depth of experience in this area could have resulted in restricted variance on this particular variable. Table 3 contains our ﬁrm performance regression results. Note that all models were highly signiﬁcant (p < .001) and in each case, explanatory power was increased signiﬁ- cantly by the addition of interaction terms that were used to assess the impact of the experience-strategy ﬁt on ﬁrm performance. Our ﬁndings indicate that industry charac- teristics, used here as control variables, are signiﬁcantly related to ﬁrm performance. We also found that industry growth has a positive effect on both proﬁtability and sales growth. Note also that global integration is inversely related to both performance measures, while technological and competitive intensity are both positively associated with performance. Turning to the strategy variables, we ﬁnd that differentiation is negatively associated with proﬁtability, yet positively related to sales growth. Strategic breadth, internationaliza- tion, and competing on the basis of cost all appear to have a positive inﬂuence on long-term sales growth. Strategic aggressiveness was not signiﬁcantly related to either measure of venture performance—perhaps indicating the risk associated with this approach. Among ﬁrms that assume a highly aggressive strategic posture, some will win and some will lose. The direct effects of team experience on venture performance were weak and incon- sistent. Therefore, hypothesis 2 was supported. A somewhat surprising ﬁnding is that previous industry experience was negatively related to both proxies for performance. Following precedents within the literature, hierarchical regressions were used to examine the impact on performance of ﬁt between experience and strategy (Amason et al., 2006; Cohen & Cohen, 1983; Jaccard, Turrisi, & Wan, 1990). For each performance measure, three models were tested. The ﬁrst examined the effects of control variables only. The second examined the effects of control variables and main effects. The third included the addition of interaction terms. The actual test of hypotheses is the signiﬁcance of the change in R2 from the second model to the third (Cohen & Cohen, 1983). In this case, both tests were highly signiﬁcant (p < .001). The strength of the relationship was reﬂected in the size of the marginal R2 (Pedhazur, 1982). In this case the addition of interactions explained an additional 9% of the variance in proﬁtability and an additional 14% of the variance in sales growth. Interaction effects, which indicated the importance of the ﬁt between experience and strategy, were strong and consistent. Thus, hypothesis 3 was strongly supported. Experi- ence with previous start-ups helped ventures pursing broad strategies (i.e., numerous customers, segments, and products) achieve higher sales growth. International experience improved both proﬁtability and sales growth among ﬁrms with higher percentages of international sales. Industry experience coupled with an emphasis on low cost enhanced how ventures fared on both measures of performance. Note that technical experience and marketing experience both interacted with differentiation to enhance performance. Finally, technical experience, coupled with strategic aggressiveness (market share target and industry position goal) appears to have had a negative and signiﬁcant effect on performance. This could indicate that more technically inclined entrepreneurs have an 902 ENTREPRENEURSHIP THEORY and PRACTICE overly optimistic view of the market potential of their technologies. If so, it would also indicate a need for more technically inclined venture teams to balance their technical knowledge with more realistic market knowledge. We conducted similar tests using two separate measures of differentiation (innovation-based and marketing-based), although these are not presented in Table 3. These results were nearly identical to those discussed earlier. The one exception is that technical experience, along with an emphasis on innovation-based differentiation, was found to be highly signiﬁcantly associated with both measures of performance (p < .001). Similarly, marketing experience, along with an emphasis on marketing-based differentia- tion appears to be highly signiﬁcantly related to both proxies for performance. In other words, results were similar, but stronger when taking a ﬁner-grained approach to opera- tionalizing the differentiation variable. Discussion and Limitations This study examined the ﬁt between team characteristics and the competitive strate- gies of new ventures. With respect to the strategic management literature, this study represents a novel application and modest extension of upper echelon theory. It also contributes to the entrepreneurship literature by highlighting the importance of studying entire entrepreneurial teams and their impact on new ventures. It also demonstrates a consistency between theoretical and empirical studies of the role of human capital in the implementation and use of new technologies (Bartel & Lichtenberg, 1987, 1990; Siegel, 1999; Siegel et al., 1997). These studies, which are based on human capital theory, assert that managers with more knowledge and experience have a comparative advantage in helping ﬁrms successfully adapt to new technologies and industries. Such workers are highly useful to high-technology, entrepreneurial ﬁrms because of their ability to solve problems and adapt to change in the external environment. The overall consistency of this study’s ﬁndings provides a degree of conﬁdence that, among these high-performing new ventures, team experience was indeed signiﬁcantly related to the competitive strategies pursued by these ﬁrms. Some of our results are unsurprising and consistent with the extant literature. For example, marketing experience was found to be positively related to an emphasis on marketing-based differentiation, technical experience was positively related to an emphasis on innovation-based differen- tiation, and international experience was related to emphasis on internationalization. Other ﬁndings were more interesting. For example, industry experience was related to an emphasis on low cost, strategic aggressiveness, and internationalization, whereas one might expect a deeper immersion in the industry to be more signiﬁcantly related to differentiation strategies. Another somewhat novel and provocative result is the impor- tance of prior ﬁnance experience, which was shown to be negatively related to strategic aggressiveness and strategic breadth. This ﬁnding provides an indication that entrepre- neurs coming from traditional corporate backgrounds may be more conservative or risk averse in their approach to new venture strategy. Another interesting insight is that our results appear to be more robust, more signiﬁcant, and more reasonable when we employ more detailed measures of the generic strategy of differentiation (i.e., marketing-based or innovation-based differentiation). Finally, the fact that increased industry and start-up experience are positively associated with internationalization is consistent with the notion that such experience can help reduce the risk associated with early internationalization (Shrader et al., 2000). November, 2007 903 A consistent theme throughout these ﬁndings was the importance of technical expe- rience to venture strategies and ultimately to performance. In terms of its impact on strategy, technical experience appears to be the most critical type of experience within the sample. Technical experience was related to the low-cost strategy, differentiation, inno- vation, an emphasis on marketing, and strategic aggressiveness. More speciﬁcally, our empirical results imply for small, technology-based new ventures; the team’s technologi- cal experience appears to be the most important determinant of the success of a differen- tiation strategy. Apparently, for technology-based ﬁrms, technical skills are critical to success regardless of the strategies they pursue. This article constitutes an important ﬁrst step in examining the relationship between team experience and competitive strategy. However, future research should be focused on exploring precisely how the experience-strategy ﬁt affects the ﬁnancial performance of new ventures. We also need to learn more the nature of experience and how it speciﬁcally relates to strategy formulation and implementation. Such research would contribute to upper echelons research, which has generally focused on large, established ﬁrms, where TMTs are often difﬁcult to isolate and where the link between management and performance is more heavily confounded by other sources of inﬂuence. In addition, strong ﬁndings could have practical implications for managers seeking to improve new venture performance through assembling appropriate entrepreneurial teams. Such knowledge would be helpful for those whose job is to select and develop upper level managers. It would also be helpful to strategists trying to predict competitors’ moves and countermoves.
