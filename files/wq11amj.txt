The positive philanthropy-  performance relationship is stronger for firms with greater public visibility and for  those with better past performance, as philanthropy by these firms gains more positive  stakeholder responses. Firms that are not government-owned or politically well con-  nected were shown to benefit more from philanthropy, as gaining political resources is  more critical for such firms. Empirical analyses using data on Chinese firms listed on  stock exchanges from 2001 to 2006 support these arguments.  Research on the relationship between corporate  philanthropy and firm profitability has largely been  inconclusive. Some scholars have argued that cor-  porate philanthropy positively affects corporate fi-  nancial performance because decisions regarding  charitable contributions can be made strategically  to raise a company's image and reputation, as well  as to increase the value of its "moral capital"  (Brammer & Millington, 2005; Godfrey, 2005; Por-  ter & Kramer, 2002; Saiia, Carroll, & Buchholtz,  2003). Philanthropy may promote products and en-  hance brand image, thus serving the role of cause-  related marketing (File & Prince, 1998). In addition,  it can mitigate the risks of reputational losses and  secure critical resources from stakeholders, hence  providing insurance-like protection (Fombrun,  Gardberg, & Barnett, 2000; Godfrey, 2005; Williams  & Barrett, 2000). On the other hand, other scholars  have argued that corporate philanthropy has a neg-  ative net impact on corporate financial perfor-  mance because it may represent a pure corporate  expenditure that diverts valuable resources to areas  unrelated to operations (Friedman, 1970). More-  over, many firms lack the expertise for efficient  We would like to thank the seminar participants at  Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Thus, rather than diverting cor-  porate resources to philanthropic activities, firms  should make better use of those resources to im-  prove their operational efficiency (Fried-  man, 1970).  Empirical research examining the relationship  between corporate philanthropy and corporate fi-  nancial performance has also generated mixed re-  sults. Some scholars have examined corporate phi-  lanthropy as a component of the larger domain of  corporate social responsibility. For instance, in an  analysis of seven large chemical companies, Griffin  and Mahon (1997) discovered that several dimen-  sions of corporate social performance are signifi-  cantly related to financial performance, but they  did not find a significant relationship for corporate  philanthropy. Similarly, Berman, Wicks, Kotha,  and Jones (1999) found that corporate involvement  in community relations, which includes philan-  thropic activities, has little influence on corporate  financial performance. In contrast, a meta-analysis  by Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes (2003) suggested  that corporate philanthropy is positively correlated  with corporate financial performance; moreover,  this relationship is stronger than that between other  measures of corporate social performance and fi-  nancial results. A similar pattern of mixed results  has also been found in studies purely on corporate  philanthropy.

Applying resource dependence the-  ory (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978), we argue that some  firms are more dependent on their nation's govern-  ment for critical resources than others (e.g., Hill-  man, 2005; Meznar & Nigh, 1995; Peng & Luo,  2000). Along these lines, firms with higher govern-  ment dependence should be in greater need of gain-  ing political legitimacy and thus are more likely to  benefit from corporate philanthropy.  pirical inconclusiveness have resulted in a frag-  mented literature in this area, hindering research  and further progress. One way to reconcile this  inconclusiveness is to recognize that firms do not  benefit equally from making charitable contribu-  tions and that the relationship between corporate  philanthropy and corporate financial performance  is contingent on some critical social and political  factors. Instead of simply listing some contingency  factors ad hoc, we set out to identify those factors  systematically by uncovering the underlying mech-  anisms through which corporate philanthropy may  have a positive impact on corporate financial per-  formance. In particular, we argue that corporate  philanthropy helps firms gain sociopolitical legiti-  macy, which further enables them to elicit positive  stakeholder responses and to gain political access.  Accordingly, two mechanisms are critical in deter-  mining the potential benefit that a firm can obtain  from charitable contributions: stakeholder re-  sponses and political access. Firms may reap either  one or both of these benefits from their philan-  thropic activities. Philanthropy can help firms gain  social legitimacy or approval from the public, in-  cluding their key stakeholders, which helps them  obtain cooperation and support from stakeholders  including employees, suppliers, customers, and  residents of a colocated community. Firms might  These ideas were tested in the context of a tran-  sition economy - China. Previous work in the field  has mostly examined Western contexts such as the  United States and the United Kingdom. Although  the conceptual arguments explored in this study  are quite general, a transition economy provides a  useful sociopolitical context in which to extend  these arguments and test them in a profound and  fine-grained manner. The diversity in China's mar-  kets and institutional environments lets us observe  large variations in some of the specific factors po-  tentially relevant to the relationship between cor-  porate philanthropy and financial performance.  Moreover, Chinese firms remain highly dependent  on their national government despite the country's  ongoing transition from a centrally controlled to a  market-based economy.

According to the  traditional view of firms, they exist solely to serve  the interests of their shareholders, which they do  by maximizing economic efficiency (Bremmer,  1987; Friedman, 1970). However, the growing in-  fluence of firms in many aspects of social and po-  litical life in recent years has led to an increasing  interest in not only the economic but also the social  consequences of their actions (Paine, 2002; Rosen,  Simon, Vincent, MacLeod, Fox, & Thea, 2003).  Consequently, a growing number of stakeholders,  including those who have direct relationships with  firms, such as employees, customers, suppliers,  and even some shareholders, have come to perceive  corporate philanthropy as an appropriate and legit-  imate corporate activity (Margolis & Walsh, 2003;  Sharfman, 1994). In some societies, governments  are in favor of corporate charitable work because it  helps reduce governmental burdens. When govern-  ments either have limited resources of their own or  are constrained from directly distributing resources  to certain community areas, the contributions of  enterprises are considered legitimate and are im-  mediately appreciated (Dickson, 2003).  Thus, corporate philanthropy helps a firm  achieve sociopolitical legitimacy, which is ob-  tained when the general public, including key  stakeholders or government officials, accept a firm  as appropriate and right in terms of existing norms  and laws (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994: 648). We have to  note that gaining acceptance from stakeholders and  government officials should not, by itself, have a  direct bearing on the financial consequences of  charitable activities. But the allocation and use of  certain resources necessary for the continued sur-  vival and financial success of a firm are often not  fully controlled by the firm alone, but rather by  some key stakeholders as well as some government  bodies (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). To the extent that  corporate philanthropy helps address the concerns  of a firm's key stakeholders and those of govern-  ment (Frooman, 1999), we propose that philan-  thropy can have an important influence on the  firm's financial performance.  This view largely agrees with some recent devel-  opments in the stakeholder theory and corporate  social responsibility literatures suggesting that a  firm may take an instrumental or strategic approach  to its stakeholders to manage their impacts on its  overall objectives (Berman et al., 1999; Godfrey,  2005; Jones, 1995; Porter & Kramer, 2002). Viewed  from this perspective, corporate philanthropy can  be regarded as a means by which firms can build  better relations with their primary stakeholders  (Saiia et al., 2003) and thus elicit positive re-  sponses, such as increased participation and sup-  port (Berman et al., 1999; Haley, 1991). For in-  stance, when a firm's employees perceive it as  virtuous or having moral worth, they should be  more willing to identify strongly with the firm  (Dutton, Dukerich, & Harquail, 1994). Stronger  identification can promote cooperation and proso-  cial behavior (Kramer, 1991; O'Reilly & Chatman,  1986; Organ, 1988). Corporate philanthropy can  promote such perceptions. Moreover, companies  that make substantial contributions are likely to  promote a socially responsible public image, which  could extend to other aspects of business practice,  such as high standards of product quality and cus-  tomer care (Adams & Hardwick, 1998: 642). This  should, in turn, help a firm gain customer support.  In addition, charitable activities may help firms  gain political legitimacy, which allows them to ob-  tain valuable political resources that can be critical  to their long-term survival and financial success  (Hillman, 2005). Contributions to social causes  send signals to government bodies that corporate  managers are sincere in dealing with their stake-  holders. This may mitigate the need for government  to impose costly regulations, such as labor and  consumer protection (Adams & Hardwick, 1998:  642), thus helping firms gain favorable policies and  other support from their government. For instance,  in its campaign to fight malaria in African coun-  tries, Exxon Mobil has not only benefited from an  enhanced reputation, but has also built a strong  relationship with local governments. This relation-  ship building has helped the firm acquire resources  from those governments, thereby advancing its stra-  tegic goals (Porter & Kramer, 2002: 11). Then, po-  litical leverage generated through corporate philan-  thropy may lead to a future government policy  decisions favorable to a firm (Neiheisel, 1994; SÃ¡n-  chez, 2000). Corporate philanthropy is especially  appreciated when governments do not have enough  resources to engage in community and social wel-  fare projects, and business contributions help alle-  viate their burdens (Dickson, 2003). Studies have  demonstrated that corporate philanthropy can help  ease access to credit, which governments often in- This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:21:11 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1162 Academy of Management Journal December  fluence or even tightly control (Neiheisel, 1994). In  summary,  sufficient." This statement further induced a repu-  tational crisis for the company, resulting in a 12  percent decrease in its stock price in just five days  (May 15-20). In contrast, the JDB group, a much  smaller company in terms of both total revenue and  profitability, made a donation of CNY100 million,  the largest donation by any Chinese company.  Sales of the firm's main product - Wanglaoji , an  herbal tea - dramatically increased within days.  The public even circulated an article posted on the  web praising Wanglaoji .  In addition to eliciting positive stakeholder re-  sponses, corporate philanthropy on the part of Chi-  nese firms lacking strong political connections may  have a role in creating goodwill with the national  government, thus conferring legitimacy and access  to political resources. In the absence of efficient  market structures and contractual law hardened by  routine compliance and enforcement, Chinese  firms may need political allies in the negotiation  and enforcement of contracts (Nee, 1992). More-  over, the political uncertainty in China is also a  critical consideration; the Communist Party holds  power, and reforms have undergone several ups  and downs (Peng & Heath, 1996: 503). Political  access enables Chinese firms to obtain government  support and favorable policies that may help deal  with such political uncertainty. For example, the  China Youth Development Foundation initiated  China's version of Project Hope in 1989, aiming to  build Hope schools and help bring poor dropout  children back to the classroom. Chinese companies  (as well as individuals) have since donated over  CNY35 billion to build 13,000 Hope primary  schools, helping 2,900,000 poor students and train-  ing 35,000 village school teachers. These contribu-  tions are appreciated, especially by local govern-  ments that do not have the financial means to build  new schools, better roads, or other similar projects  (Dickson, 2003). Government can reward firms that  make such contributions with tax benefits, access  to bank loans, easier project approval, and higher  recognition and status for the owners (Bai, Lu, &  Tao, 2006; Ma & Parish, 2006).  In summary, Chinese stakeholders expect corpo-  rate philanthropy because of the influence of tradi-  tional values and recent sociopolitical factors. As a  result, they are likely to respond to corporate phi-  lanthropy by showing greater cooperation and sup-  port. Moreover, the Chinese government and local  authorities are more willing to cooperate with and  recognize firms and managers who are active in  charitable activities by providing them with critical  resources when their rights are inadequately de-  fined or enforced and when there is political un-  certainty (Dickson, 2003; Nee, 1992). Sociopolitical  Hypothesis 1. Corporate philanthropy is posi-  tively related to a firm's financial performance .  Corporate Philanthropy in China  Traditionally, the Chinese are deeply influenced  by the Buddhist, Daoist, and Confucian philoso-  phies. Buddhists believe that compassion is a prin-  cipal virtue in life. People should be kind-hearted  and benevolent. Similarly, Daoism emphasizes that  a person should be aware of the needs of others.  What may be the most important force shaping  China's social values is the widely held set of Con-  fucian beliefs, which define family relations, social  order, and trust. In Confucianism, a person who  spreads bounty or who rescues people is consid-  ered a sage.1 One of the most famous Confucian  sayings is, "A nation or a family does not worry that  it has little but that that little is unevenly appor-  tioned, does not worry that it is poor but that it is  unstable" (Watson, 2007: 115).  Despite their significant departure from tradi-  tional Chinese values, the more recent communist  ideologies share a similar view that there should be  no disparity in the distribution of wealth in society.  Communism is based on common property and the  equal distribution of wealth; it aspires to an egali-  tarian and classless society based on common own-  ership and control. One of its goals is to extinguish  private ownership. In China, the Communist Party  once viewed wealth as the outcome of the exploi-  tation of the poor, and thus undesirable, and such  negative attitudes toward the rich still persist  among many Chinese. Although the rapid develop-  ment of the Chinese economy has resulted in pos-  itive changes in the public's perceptions of the  wealthy, Chinese people are still deeply influenced  by traditional values and communist ideologies  (Hofstede, 2001; Leung, 2008). Therefore, they  praise compassionate behaviors, and the Chinese  stakeholders of firms are more likely to embrace  those that contribute generously. The reactions of  Chinese stakeholders to corporate contributions af-  ter the earthquake in Sichuan on May 12, 2008,  exemplify this. Vanke, one of the largest and most  profitable Chinese real estate firms, donated only  CNY2 million for earthquake relief. The public  strongly criticized this relatively small donation.  The chairman of Vanke subsequently defended the  company's behavior by stating, "Two million is  1 Generated from the discussion between Confucius  and one of his students, Zigong (Watson, 2007: 46).

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORPORATE  PHILANTHROPY AND CORPORATE  FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE: SOME  CONTINGENCIES  Although corporate philanthropy helps firms  gain stakeholder and government support and is  thus positively related to firm financial perfor-  mance, the relationship between corporate philan-  thropy and financial performance is expected to  vary significantly with the different characteristics  of firms and their operational environments. We  consider several potential factors that may help  determine this variance, namely, firm visibility and  stakeholder expectation, which are considered to  affect stakeholder response to corporate philan-  thropy, and government ownership and political  connections, which determine the firms' need for  political resources.  about its charitable activities to make a meaningful  response (McWilliams & Siegel, 2001). Thus, visi-  bility should increase the benefit that a firm may  obtain from corporate philanthropy. However, ex-  ternal stakeholders such as suppliers and custom-  ers may be only dimly or not at all aware of the  extent of a firm's charitable activities, since they  would not normally be direct beneficiaries (Wang,  Choi, & Li, 2008). In the case of low visibility and  stakeholder awareness, a firm will not benefit as  much from engaging in philanthropy.  The intensity of a firm's advertising can be an  important indicator of its visibility. Clearly, inten-  sive advertising and marketing attract more atten-  tion from external stakeholders, especially from ex-  isting and prospective customers and potential  employees (Brammer & Millington, 2005). There-  fore, a firm advertising heavily is more likely to be  known to various stakeholders, and as a result its  charitable contributions are more likely to be rec-  ognized (Adams & Hardwick, 1998). It then follows  that firms that do more advertising are likely to  benefit more from their corporate philanthropy.  These arguments should equally apply to Chinese  firms, which have increasingly considered adver-  tising as an investment with strategic implications  (Luo, 2009).  Positive Stakeholder Responses and the Benefits  of Corporate Philanthropy  Influences on stakeholder response to corporate  philanthropy include firm visibility and stake-  holder expectations. We capture firm visibility  through two firm and environmental features: ad-  vertising intensity and degree of market develop-  ment. Stakeholder expectations, on the other hand,  are thought to be influenced by a firm's past finan-  cial performance.  Firm visibility: Advertising intensity and mar-  ket development Firm visibility serves as a pre-  requisite for stakeholder response to firm actions.  Some recent research has shown that a firm's visi-  bility (or prominence) is generally associated with  positive responses from its stakeholders, including  favorable evaluations from investors and the media  (Pollock et al., 2008), customers' willingness to pay  a price premium (Rindova et al., 2005), and an  increased attractiveness to potential alliance part-  ners (Pollock & Gulati, 2007). On the other hand,  since visible firms draw greater attention from their  stakeholders, visibility may exacerbate the ten-  dency for firms to take excess risks to meet height-  ened stakeholder expectations. For instance,  Mishina, Dykes, Block, and Pollock (2010) found ev-  idence that firm prominence positively moderated  the effect of performance above expectations on a  firm's likelihood of engaging in illegal activities.  In the case of corporate philanthropy, stakehold-  ers have to know about a firm and have information  Hypothesis 2a. The positive relationship be-  tween corporate philanthropy and a firm's fi-  nancial performance increases with its adver-  tising intensity.  Aside from advertising, a firm's visibility or  stakeholder awareness also depends on the level of  development of the market in which it operates. In  general, firms located in relatively developed mar-  kets are more transparent and thus have higher  visibility among the public and stakeholders. The  public obtains information about a firm either di-  rectly from it or through other channels, such as the  media or the stock market (Fombrun & Shanley,  1990). More developed markets not only provide  firms with greater transactional efficiency, but also  provide more advanced technology, media expo-  sure, and capital markets, facilitating the flow of  information from the firms to their stakeholders.  Thus it is more likely that stakeholders of firms  located in more developed markets will know  about the firms' charitable contributions more  promptly and accurately. Subsequently, these  stakeholders will be in a better position to react to  the charitable behavior by providing greater coop-  eration and support, tending to improve firm per-  formance. In contrast, the philanthropic efforts of  firms competing in less developed markets will be This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:21:11 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1164 Academy of Management Journal December  less noticed because information about them is not  efficiently communicated.  Although variations in the level of market devel-  opment are often found among countries, in some  economies such variations can be observed among  regions. China is one such economy. Although  China has made great progress in recent decades,  the levels of market development in its different  regions are far from equal (Fan & Wang, 2006). The  coastal and eastern regions are relatively well de-  veloped, but the central and western regions re-  main largely underdeveloped. As a result, there are  big differences among China's regions in prevailing  wages, information flow, technology, and infra-  structure (Qian, 2001). This logic leads to the  following:  Hypothesis 2b. The positive relationship be-  tween corporate philanthropy and a firm's fi-  nancial performance increases with the level of  development of the market in which the firm  operates.  Stakeholder expectations: Past financial per-  formance. Stakeholders are generally interested in  corporate philanthropy and willing to respond pos-  itively to a firm they know to be active in charitable  activities, yet their expectations for and thus re-  sponses to corporate philanthropy may be influ-  enced by the extent to which a firm is financially  constrained from engaging in such activities.  Firms face both internal and external constraints  that may limit managerial discretion over invest-  ment decisions (Hambrick & Finkelstein, 1987).  The constraints should be greater if the firms are to  engage in activities that go beyond those directly  related to their business operations. Thus, corpo-  rate philanthropy, which is considered a social ac-  tivity often remote from a firm's core business, is  likely to face various constraints. Among the nu-  merous factors, a firm's profitability (past financial  performance) is considered to be one of the most  important constraints on corporate philanthropy. A  better-performing firm has more financial and  physical resources that would allow it to engage in  philanthropic activities. Consistently with this rea-  soning, Dooley and Lerner (1994) found that firm  performance influences the extent to which CEOs  are concerned with the expectations of stakehold-  ers. In the context of the current study, a profitable  firm would have more financial and physical re-  sources to devote to activities that go beyond those  directly related to its business operations.  Likewise, members of the public expect better-  performing firms to contribute more to society.  Moreover, they have greater motivation to reward  those that do so. On the other hand, when a firm is  performing poorly, stakeholders may understand  that its limited resources should be used to im-  prove its business operations instead of being di-  verted to charity. Following this logic, good per-  formers should benefit more from corporate  philanthropy than poor performers, since the for-  mer are more likely to receive a positive stake-  holder response from their charitable giving.  This logic may be better understood using an  idea related to the association between pragmatic  legitimacy and moral legitimacy (Suchman, 1995).  "Pragmatic legitimacy" refers to the self-interested  calculations of an organization's most immediate  audiences, and "moral legitimacy," a construct  very much in line with the social dimension of  sociopolitical legitimacy (Aldrich & Fiol, 1994;  Dart, 2004), refers to the public's normative evalu-  ation of an organization and its activities (Such-  man, 1995: 578-579). As argued earlier, corporate  philanthropy helps a firm gain sociopolitical legit-  imacy. However, pragmatic legitimacy, which is  largely based on stakeholders' utility calculations  (Donaldson & Preston, 1995; Jones, 1995; Suchman,  1995), may influence the value of gaining sociopo-  litical legitimacy. Firms with high profitability are  more likely to gain pragmatic legitimacy, typically  by directing tangible rewards to stakeholders, such  as granting employees better compensation, pro-  viding shareholders higher dividends, and deliver-  ing better-quality products to customers (Suchman,  1995). If a firm lacks pragmatic legitimacy (i.e.,  does not satisfy stakeholders' basic financial  needs), stakeholders may attach less value to firm  behaviors aimed at gaining sociopolitical or moral  legitimacy. In other words, the concerns of stake-  holders about a firm's contribution to society, and  thus their motivations to respond positively,  should be stronger when the firm has fulfilled its  responsibility of meeting their basic finan-  cial needs.  Such differences in stakeholder responses to cor-  porate philanthropy based on past firm perfor-  mance should exist in both developed and devel-  oping economies alike, including China.

Thus, government policy and its enforcement con-  stitute a major external source of uncertainty and a  critical influence on a firm's operations (Hillman,  Zardkoohi, & Bierman, 1999).  ment ownership differs in magnitude and historical  legacy across Europe, many European economies,  including the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland,  Austria, Italy, have nontrivial government owner-  ship (Faccio & Lang, 2002). Typical sectors with  state ownership include telecommunications,  power, petroleum, railways, airports, airlines, pub-  lic transport, health care, postal services, and  banks. Many large industrial firms, such as British  Steel, Statoil, and Irish Sugar, are also wholly or  partially government-owned.  According to resource dependence theory, firms  can take political action to decrease risk and uncer-  tainty associated with government influence (Hill-  man, Withers, & Collins, 2009; Pfeffer & Salancik,  1978). This is a compelling rationale for why firms  strive to establish good relationships with govern-  ments (e.g., Hillman, 2005; Hillman & Hitt, 1999).  Firms that have good relations with their govern-  ment can reduce the uncertainty associated with  changes in government policy and regulations and  thereby improve their long-run financial perfor-  mance (Hillman, 2005). Previous research has ex-  amined various measures firms may adopt to estab-  lish good firm-government relations. These include  lobbying, advocacy advertising, organizing politi-  cal action committees, making financial contribu-  tions, forming coalitions, and offering jobs to for-  mer government officials (Getz, 1997; Hillman et  al., 1999; Hillman & Hitt, 1999; Hillman, Keim, &  Schuler, 2004; Lester, Hillman, Zardkoohi, & Can-  nella, 2008; Shaffer, 1995).  The leaders of firms with government ownership  or sponsorship generally do not have to worry  about political access as much as the leaders of  privately controlled firms do, because the firms  already enjoy preferential treatment in terms of in-  puts and access to product and capital markets  (Wang, Wong, & Xia, 2008). For example, Hellman,  Jones, and Kaufmann (2003) found that state-  owned firms have more secure property, greater  contractual rights, and closer ties with government.  As a result, they enjoy significant advantages and  exhibit faster growth. On the other hand, firms  without government ownership have less secure  property and contractual rights and thus are in  greater need of assuring political access by estab-  lishing good government relations through other  means, such as corporate philanthropy. Therefore,  non-government-owned firms have a greater need  to gain political access through charitable activities  and are thus likely to benefit more from corporate  philanthropy.  Unlike the above political tactics, which often  explicitly target government, corporate philan-  thropy targets society at large. Thus its connection  with government and political resources is indirect  and sometimes even unintentional. However, to the  extent that corporate philanthropy meets govern-  ment needs for providing social services, it may  substitute for other means of establishing links  with a government. Thus, viewed from a resource  dependence perspective, corporate philanthropy  helps a firm reduce the risks associated with gov-  ernment influence. Consequently, firms more de-  pendent on government for political resources  should be more likely to benefit from corporate  philanthropy.  We examine two specific factors that may deter-  mine a firm's degree of dependence on the govern-  ment: government ownership and political connec-  tions.  Government ownership. Firms with varying de-  grees of government ownership or government  sponsorship are present around the globe, even in  most market-oriented, developed economies (La  Porta et al., 1999). For instance, although govern-  In China, non-government-owned, or privately  controlled, firms have proliferated since the 1980s.  But uncertainty about their legal status remains.  Private ownership was declared legal in 1988, but  owners remain worried about possible policy rever-  sals that could devalue their ownership. Moreover,  access to critical factors and capital resources such  as debt financing is least favorable for privately  controlled firms (Nee, 1992). To overcome these  disadvantages, privately controlled firms may have  incentives to engage in charitable activities as a  means of creating goodwill with potential regula-  tors and government officials (Neiheisel, 1994). A  relevant survey showed that over 99 percent of all  public officials and 80 percent of all private Chi-  nese entrepreneurs believe that the social and po-  litical status of entrepreneurs and their firms  clearly improves when they contribute to local  causes (Dickson, 2003).  The above argument suggests that at the same  level of corporate philanthropy, the political re-  turns will be higher for non-government-owned  firms than for government-owned ones.

It has been widely ob-  tween corporate philanthropy and financial  performance is stronger for firms without po-  litical connections than for those with political  connections.  Therefore, the political benefits that firms obtain  from corporate philanthropy should depend on  their need for political resources (Li & Zhang, 2007;  Peng & Luo, 2000).  served that firms with political connections may  enjoy "preferential treatment by government-  owned enterprises (such as banks or raw material  producers), lighter taxation, preferential treatment  in competition for government contracts, relaxed  regulatory oversight of the company, or stiffer reg-  ulatory oversight of its rivals, and many other  forms" (Faccio, 2006: 369). Firms cultivate political  connections to manage the dependencies that con-  strain their actions, decreasing risk and uncer-  tainty, and to gain access, information, legitimacy,  and/or resources (Hillman, 2005). For instance, ac-  cess to bank financing is known to be an important  channel through which political connections oper-  ate (Ciaessens, Feijen, & Laeven, 2008; Khwaja &  Mian, 2005). Analyzing a sample of 450 politically  connected firms from 35 countries (including the  United States, the United Kingdom, and other de-  veloped countries) during 1997-2002, Faccio,  Masulis, and McConnell (2006) found that politi-  cally connected firms were significantly more  likely to be bailed out from economic distress than  similar, poorly connected firms.  either the Shenzhen or Shanghai stock exchange  between 2001 and 2006. The combined capitaliza-  tion of the two exchanges was approximately 46  percent of China's gross domestic product (GDP) in  2006. 2 We chose 2001 as the initial study year  because the quality of reported company informa-  tion substantially improved in that year and after-  ward (Fan et al., 2007). Several data sources were  used: the China Stock Market and Accounting Re-  search (CSMAR) database, the National Economic  Research Institute (NERI), and company annual re-  ports.

Moreover, apart from the public re-  lations benefits, firms that engaged in philanthropy  have strong tax reasons to report their expenses.  Hence, the sample was limited to firms that actu-  ally engaged in charitable activities.  nancial performance was evaluated in terms of  ROA and market-to-book ratio following the year in  which the charitable contributions were made (a  one-year lag).  Corporate philanthropy. Corporate giving was  Simply conducting regression analysis with this  sample of firms, however, would not have been  appropriate. This is because firms that engaged in  philanthropic activities may differ systematically  from those that did not. Specifically, it is possible  that the factors affecting whether a firm engages in  corporate giving may be correlated with our depen-  dent variable - firm financial performance. We  therefore used a two-stage Heckman selection  model (Heckman, 1979) to correct for any such  sample selection bias. In such analyses, parameter  estimates from a first-stage probit model based on  information that represents all the firms in a pop-  ulation are incorporated into the second stage. This  two-stage approach also ensured comparability  with some of the previous research in this area (e.g.,  Brammer & Millington, 2008; Wang, Choi, & Li,  2008). After we had merged the three databases and  removed observations with missing key explana-  tory variables, the final unbalanced sample con-  tained 1,453 firms and 2,765 firm-year observa-  tions.3  assessed as the amount of a firm's charitable con-  tributions during a specific year. The variable was  highly skewed, so, following the lead of previous  studies (Adams & Hardwick, 1998; Galaskiewicz,  1997), we computed its natural logarithm.  Moderating variables. Firm advertising inten-  sity was calculated as the ratio of selling, general,  and administrative expenses to sales. It captures a  firm's willingness to spend on marketing and sell-  ing-related activities in an effort to differentiate  itself from competitors (Berman et al., 1999; Ham-  brick, 1983; McWilliams & Siegel, 2001; Seifert et  al., 2004). Market development was assessed from  indexes developed by the NERI (Fan & Wang, 2006)  and computed using data from Chinese statistical  yearbooks, reports from the administrations of in-  dustry and commerce, and surveys. The NERI in-  dexes capture the progress of institutional develop-  ment in all 31 Chinese provinces, municipalities,  and autonomous regions. Following the lead of pre-  vious research (Fan et al., 2007), we used one in-  dex - a province's GDP divided by its government's  budget - to measure market development This  variable was used to reflect the extent to which  provincial resources are allocated by markets rather  than through the redistribution system of the Chi-  nese government. The development score of the  province where a firm operates was used as the  level of market development for the firm. For firms  operating in multiple provinces, we used the score  of its primary location.5 Past financial performance  was measured as ROA and market-to-book ratio  lagged by one year.  Government ownership was a dummy variable  coded 1 if the ultimate owner of a firm was the  Chinese government and its agencies and 0 other-  wise (Wang, Wong, & Xia, 2008). Following the  methods of previous research on the political con-  nections of China's listed firms (Fan et al., 2007; Li,  Meng, Wang, & Zhou, 2008; Li, Meng, & Zhang,  2006), we used a firm's CEO's affiliation with gov-  ernment as an indicator of the firm's political con-  nections, which was a dummy variable equal to 1 if  the CEO was an official of the central or a local  government, or of the military, and 0 otherwise.  Measures  Financial performance. Two measures of finan-  cial performance were employed: return on assets  (ROA) and market-to-book ratio. ROA, calculated  as net income over total assets, is a common ac-  counting-based measure of financial performance.  Market-to-book ratio4 is calculated as the book  value of a firm's equity divided by the year-end  market value of its equity (Ashbaugh-Skaife, Col-  lins, Kinney, & LaFond, 2008). Both measures have  been commonly used in management research (e.g.,  Hillman, 2005; Tuschke & Sanders, 2003). There is  often a lag between corporate contributions and  their impact on financial performance, so the rela-  tionship between corporate contributions and fi-  3 Note that the final observations used in the regres-  sion cover 2001-05 instead of the sample period of  2001-06 because of our use of a lagged regression  structure.  4 This measure is theoretically and empirically equiv-  5 This is reasonable because most Chinese firms com-  alent to Tobin's Q.

Including a lagged dependent vari-  able in the equation is a common approach used in  dealing with pooled time series and cross-sectional  panel data (e.g., Beck & Katz, 1995; Dittmar &  Mahrt-Smith, 2007; Harford, Mansi, & Maxwell,  2008; Wang, Choi, & Li, 2008). In the context of this  study, we included it to mitigate concern about  reverse causality (i.e., good financial performance  leads to greater philanthropy instead of the other  way around).7  All these control variables were included in the  first-stage probit model to predict the likelihood  that a firm would make charitable contributions,  but all were lagged by one additional year. Firm  size, age, and debt ratio may have some effects on  the likelihood of a firm's engagement in corporate  philanthropy. Larger and older firms have greater  visibility, and they attract more scrutiny from the  public (Adams & Hardwick, 1998; Saiia et al., 2003;  Seifert et al., 2004). A firm's debt ratio reflects the  financial constraints its managers face, which in  turn affect their discretion in making charitable  contributions (Adams & Hardwick, 1998; Brammer  & Millington, 2008). Firms with greater need to  advertise may be more likely to engage in corporate  philanthropy because philanthropy is often consid-  ered a form of advertising that improves image and  reputation (Seifert et al., 2004). As has been argued  earlier, firms with better financial performance  may be more likely to make contributions, since  they can better afford to do so. Thus, we also in-  cluded prior financial performance in the first-  stage model. Government ownership and CEO po-  litical connections were also included in the first-  stage model because they may affect the likelihood  Estimation Method  The first stage of the Heckman process involved  estimating the degree to which a firm's level of  charitable contributions differed from that pre-  dicted by various firm and industry factors. The  likelihood of a firm's charitable contributions was  estimated by applying a probit model to the entire  sample of firms, including firms in both the main  sample and the control group. We calculated an  adjustment term, the inverse Mills ratio, from the  first-stage probit regression. The ratio was then in-  cluded as a control variable in the main second-  6 The categories are agriculture, forestry, livestock  rearing and fishing; mining; manufacturing; electric  power, gas, and water production and supply; construc-  tion; transport and storage; information technology;  wholesale and retail trade; finance and insurance; real  estate; social service; communication and cultural indus-  tries; and a comprehensive residual category.  7 To ensure that including a lagged dependent variable  did not result in biased estimations owing to the poten-  tial existence of serial correlated errors, we ran a Prais-  Winsten (1954) regression estimation, which uses the  generalized least squares method to estimate the param-  eters in a linear regression model in which the errors are  assumed to follow a first-order autoregressive process.  The Prais analysis results were consistent with what we  report here, so autocorrelation was not a serious concern.

The correlations be-  tween the level of charitable giving and subsequent  financial performance were positive for ROA (0.16)  but not for market-to-book ratio (-0.06). Significant  correlations were found among some variables,  such as ROA, advertising intensity, and firm size;  hence, we further investigated whether there was a  potential multicollinearity problem by computing  variance inflation factors (VIFs). The maximum VIF  obtained in any of the models was 7.81 (firm size),  and the mean VIF was around 2.40, substantially  below the rule-of-thumb cutoff of 10.00 for regres-  sion models (Ryan, 1997). Therefore, multicol-  linearity was not an important issue in our results.  First-Stage Giving Choice Estimates  Prior financial performance measured as ROA  showed a positive impact on corporate philan-  thropy, but the market-based performance measure  did not yield a significant effect. As expected, CEO  political connections and industry-level giving  were positively associated with the choice of cor-  porate giving. Contrary to expectations (Seifert et  al., 2004), however, advertising intensity had a neg-  ative and significant impact on the probability of  giving. Possibly direct advertising and corporate  philanthropy are considered substitutive means of  attracting positive public responses. Moreover,  Chinese listed firms are still in the early stages of  development and facing stringent financial con-  straints. Thus, as advertising expenses increase,  Chinese firms may defer corporate giving.  Second-Stage Financial Performance Estimates  Table 2 presents the results of the first-stage  Heckman selection model, which was a probit re-  gression of the choice of charitable giving against  the factors thought to predict whether a firm will  engage in charitable giving. The dependent variable  was the dummy variable giving choice , indicating  whether a firm engaged in corporate giving. Model  1, the baseline model, included an intercept term  and the measures of firm-level variables. Model 2  added industry-level giving and industry dummy  variables as additional factors expected to affect  corporate giving behavior. As anticipated, larger  firms were found to be more likely to engage in  charitable giving. The coefficients on firm age and  slack resources had positive but insignificant signs.  Table 3 presents the results of Heckman's sec-  ond-stage estimation using the inverse Mills ratio  from the first-stage probit model in Table 2, ac-  counting for selection bias. Panels A and Ð corre-  spond to the models using the two different mea-  sures of financial performance: ROA and market-  to-book ratio. Hierarchical multiple regression  analysis was used to test for the hypothesized pos-  itive relationship between corporate contributions  and financial performance and to test for the inter-  action effects.  Models Al and Bl report the effects of the basic  firm-level control variables: past (lagged) financial  performance, firm age, firm size, and debt ratio.

Past financial performance showed a  significant, positive relationship with financial  performance. Firm age was negatively associated  with ROA but not with market-to-book ratio. Al-  though firm size was negatively associated with  market-to-book ratio, market development and gov-  ernment ownership were positively associated  with ROA.  cients for the interaction term between CEO polit-  ical connections and corporate giving, however,  were not significant for either measure of financial  performance. Hence, we did not find any support  for Hypothesis 3b.  In models A3 and B3, the level of corporate giv-  ing was added to the regression equation. In the  subsequent models A4-A8 and B4-B8, we sequen-  tially added the interaction terms between corpo-  rate giving and the key moderating variables (ad-  vertising intensity, market development, past  financial performance, government ownership, and  CEO political connections). Models A8 and B8 are  the full models including all the interactions. We  reported the results based on these two full models.  In keeping with our prediction, corporate giving  had a positive and significant relationship with  financial performance measured as ROA (p < .001).  It was not, however, significantly related to market-  to-book ratio. These results partially support Hy-  pothesis 1.  Hypotheses 2a and 2b predict that advertising  intensity and the level of market development pos-  itively moderate the relationship between corpo-  rate giving and financial performance. As shown in  models A8 and B8, the interaction term between  corporate giving and advertising intensity was pos-  itive and significant for both ROA and market-to-  book ratio, strongly supporting Hypothesis 2a.  However, the interaction term between corporate  giving and market development was significant for  market-to-book ratio but not for ROA, so was also  partially supported.  Hypothesis 2c predicts that past financial perfor-  mance positively moderates the relationship be-  tween corporate giving and financial performance.  The coefficient on the interaction term in models  A8 and B8 was significant for both measures of firm  financial performance (both at p < .001). Therefore,  Hypothesis 2c was supported.  Hypotheses 3a and 3b predict that the positive  relationship between corporate giving and finan-  cial performance is stronger for privately controlled  firms and for firms without political connections.  The negative and significant coefficients of the in-  teraction term between corporate giving and gov-  ernment ownership for both measures of financial  performance were consistent with our prediction  (ROA, at p < .05; market-to-book ratio, at p < .01).  Thus, Hypothesis 3a was supported. The coeffi-  To interpret these results better, we used Aiken  and West's (1991) approach to plot the significant  interaction effects (Figures 1A-4B ). The figures  show that at high levels of advertising intensity,  market development, and past financial perfor-  mance, the relationship between corporate giving  and firm performance is more positive. In contrast,  at low levels of these variables the relationship  tends to become negative or less positive. Also, the  relationship is more positive for firms that are pri-  vately controlled.  These effects are both statistically and practically  significant. For example, for firms with high visi-  bility as indicated by advertising intensity, as cor-  porate giving increases by one standard deviation,  ROA increases by 1.2 percent, and market-to-book  ratio increases by 15 percent (see models A8 and B8  and the corresponding Figure 1A and IB). In con-  trast, for firms with low levels of advertising inten-  sity, the same increase in giving is associated with  slight decreases in ROA (by 0.03%) and sharp de-  creases in market-to-book ratio (by 18.5%). In Fig-  ure 2, for firms operating in more developed re-  gions, as giving increases by one standard  deviation, market-to-book ratio increases by 18 per-  cent; in contrast, the figure shows a decrease in the  ratio of 21 percent for firms in less developed re-  gions. Similarly, significant patterns of change can  also be found for models with other moderators,  including past financial performance and govern-  ment ownership, as shown in Figures ÐÐ, 3B, 4A,  and 4B.  DISCUSSION  We have argued that corporate philanthropy en-  hances a firm's financial performance by eliciting  positive responses from its key stakeholders, such  as employees, customers, and investors, and by  gaining political resources from government. More-  over, we have suggested that this positive relation-  ship between corporate philanthropy and financial  performance should be contingent on the extent to  which stakeholders positively respond to philan-  thropic giving and on whether the firm is in need of  political access. Our analyses generally supported  these predictions using either accounting or mar-  ket-based financial performance measures. We  found a positive relationship between corporate  philanthropy and financial performance as mea-  sured by ROA (though not for performance mea- This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:21:11 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1174 Academy of Management Journal December  Interaction Effect between Corporate Giving and Advertising Intensity on ROA  FIGURE 1A  Interaction Effect between Corporate Giving and Advertising Intensity on Market-to-Book Ratio  FIGURE IB  sured as market-to-book ratio). Further, the rela-  tionship was generally stronger for highly visible  and profitable firms and for firms in need of polit-  ical resources.  lanthropy and performance. These findings help  build a stronger theoretical foundation for a link  between corporate philanthropy and financial per-  formance.  This study makes a number of contributions to  the literature on corporate philanthropy. First,  building on the general idea that corporate philan-  thropy helps firms gain sociopolitical legitimacy,  we have identified two mechanisms - eliciting pos-  itive stakeholder responses and gaining political  access - that underlie the relationship between phi-  We have also further elucidated the contingent  factors influencing the relationship between corpo-  rate philanthropy and financial performance.

Previous research  has only occasionally hinted at but never explicitly  examined the testable hypotheses that we have pro-  posed. There have been calls for an examination of  the conditions delimiting the social responsibility-  financial performance relationship (Barnett, 2007;  Hull & Rothenberg, 2008), and this study is a re-  sponse providing a better understanding of the un-  derlying mechanisms through which corporate phi-  lanthropy is related to a firm's financial  performance.  According to the meta-analysis of 167 studies of  corporate social and financial performance by Mar-  golis, Elfenbein, and Walsh (2007), no previous  study has investigated the relationship between  corporate philanthropy and financial performance  in a transition economy. Transition economies  such as China are different from developed markets  in which institutional conditions are well estab-  lished, so they offer a promising new context for  examining the generalizability of findings devel-  oped in Western contexts (Wright, Filatotchev,  Hoskisson, & Peng, 2005). The results developed  here demonstrate that without understanding a so-  ciety's broad values and political system, one may  fail to understand philanthropy and its implica-  tions for corporate financial performance in a com-  plex social system.  eliciting positive responses from various stakehold-  ers), but can also help Chinese firms gain legiti-  macy and political support from their government.  This view suggests that it is generally helpful for  Chinese managers to commit firm resources to cor-  porate philanthropy. However, we have further  demonstrated that Chinese firms do not all equally  benefit from philanthropy. Stakeholders will re-  spond more positively when they are aware of such  activities, so firms with more visibility, such as  those advertising heavily and/or operating in more  developed regions, have the most to gain. Managers  whose firms are already active in corporate philan-  thropy should find ways to attract the attention of  stakeholders and to make them aware of the firms'  contributions. In addition, seeing that the relation-  ship between corporate philanthropy and financial  performance strengthens with past performance,  managers of successful firms should be more active  in philanthropic activities. In contrast, firms per-  forming poorly have less to gain from engaging in  charitable giving. They might instead place greater  emphasis on improving operational efficiency.  Managers of privately owned firms should be par-  ticularly active in corporate philanthropic activi-  ties because they are in greater need of political  support and resources from the government.  The interpretation of the current findings should  be considered in light of the limitations associated  with this study. First, we focused on only one di-  mension of corporate social activity: corporate phi-  lanthropy and its links with financial performance.  Future research might profitably examine other di-  mensions of social responsibility, such as those  associated with the environment, products, and  community activities. In addition, a systematic ex-  These results have practical implications as well.  There have been debates about whether firms  should engage in philanthropic activities (e.g., Grif-  fin & Mahon, 1997; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Saiia et al.,  2003). We contend that charitable giving is not only  consistent with Chinese traditional values (thus This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:21:11 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1176 Academy of Management Journal December  Interaction Effect between Corporate Giving and Firm Past Financial Performance on ROA  FIGURE ÐÐ  Interaction Effect between Corporate Giving and Firm Past Financial Performance on  Market-to-Book Ratio  FIGURE 3B  amination of corporate social responsibility in tran-  sition economies in general could be promising. Of  course, unlike in the United States, where there are  secondhand databases that evaluate corporate so-  cial performance, the collection of data on corpo-  rate social behaviors is generally more challenging  in China and in other transition economies. But as  data on other dimensions of corporate social per-  formance in transitional contexts become gradually  available, it would be very interesting to under-  stand whether those activities have the same im-  pact on corporate financial performance as corpo-  rate philanthropy does.  Second, although we have argued that corporate  philanthropy influences financial performance by  eliciting positive stakeholder responses and/or by  affording political access, data limitations pre-  vented our directly measuring some of the factors This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 23:21:11 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2011 Wang and Qian 1177  Interaction Effect between Corporate Giving and Ownership Type on ROA  FIGURE 4A  Interaction Effect between Corporate Giving and Ownership Type on Market-to-Book Ratio  FIGURE 4B  (e.g., stakeholder response) underlying these mech-  anisms. We have, though, identified several key  conditions for which these two mechanisms are  likely to be critical. The arguments and empirical  tests would be greatly strengthened if future studies  could directly explore these underlying mecha-  nisms or, alternatively, find even better conditional  factors. For example, future studies might go be-  yond the factors that we have identified as influ-  encing stakeholder responses (firm visibility and  stakeholder expectation) and study the perfor-  mance benefits of eliciting positive responses.  Moreover, our measurements of some of the mod-  erating variables have limitations. For example, the  moderating effect of political connections was  found to be relatively weak, but this might be be-  cause our measure focused only on the connections  of a firm's CEO. Future research might set out to  construct more robust measures, including, for ex-  ample, other political connections through board  members and a firm's other top managers. Also, in  addition to the two variables that we have used to  capture the need for political resources (ownership  type and political connections), future research  could examine other contingent factors that could  reflect a firm's political access, such as whether its  managers are involved in political networking (Li &  Zhang, 2007).  Fourth, we used advertising expenditures as our  proxy for visibility, but our finding that it posi-  tively influences the relationship between philan-  thropy and financial performance contrasts with  those of Hull and Rothenberg (2008). They sug-  gested that corporate social activities function as a  differentiating mechanism that can substitute for  advertising and innovation.

E., & Fiol, C. M. 1994. Fools rush in? The  institutional context of industry creation. Academy  of Management Review, 19: 645-670.  Hull and Rothenberg (2008) concluded that adver-  tising, as a form of industry differentiation, nega-  tively affects the social-financial performance rela-  tionship. Future studies might fruitfully attempt to  resolve these somewhat contradictory arguments.  In particular, it would be worthwhile to examine  whether the opposite findings reflect differences in  the empirical contexts (China vs. the United States)  or differences between philanthropy and corporate  social responsibility in general.

Future researchers  may consider testing these arguments using alter-  native data, such as those from developed econo-  mies. Also, our sample was limited to publicly  listed companies. Despite their large total market  capitalization, publicly listed companies only rep-  resent a subset of Chinese enterprises, and good  performance was presumably a prerequisite for  stock market listing (Xu & Wang, 1999). Our results  should therefore be generalized only with caution,  as their applicability may be limited to the unique  cultural and social environment surrounding listed  Chinese companies. Future research could attempt  to confirm these results in other economies, includ-  ing both developing and developed ones.  1999. Does stakeholder orientation matter?

Conclusions  By analyzing data on the philanthropic activities  of publicly listed Chinese firms from 2001 to 2006,  we have demonstrated that corporate philanthropy  enhances corporate financial performance by en-  abling firms to elicit better stakeholder responses  and to gain political resources. We hope that this  study will serve as an important step toward a  better understanding of the relationship between  corporate social behavior and financial perfor-  mance. Future studies can bring new insights by  examining the influence of other potential factors,  especially those related to various sociopolitical  contexts, on the relationship between corporate  philanthropy and firm financial performance.
