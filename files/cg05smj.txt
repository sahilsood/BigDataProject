We test the effects of stakeholder management on CEOs’ salaries, bonuses, stock options, and total compensation. We also examine the extent to which the interaction of stakeholder management and ﬁnancial performance determines compensation. Using a longitudinal database of 406 Fortune 1000 ﬁrms, our results suggest that stakeholder management is relevant to boards of directors when setting CEO compensation. Speciﬁcally, we found a signiﬁcant, negative main effect of stakeholder management on CEO salaries. Further, we found that stakeholder management typically reduces the rewards CEOs may get for increasing levels of ﬁnancial performance. In tandem, these results indicate that CEOs may jeopardize their personal wealth by pursuing stakeholder-related initiatives. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. CEO compensation is one of the most widely researched areas in management. Much of this research has focused on determining whether and to what extent CEOs are rewarded for superior organizational performance. Despite this work, empirical support for this relationship has been mixed. In a recent CEO compensation meta- analysis, Tosi et al. (2000) reported that ﬁnancial performance accounted for approximately 5 per- cent of the variance in CEO compensation, with ﬁrm size exerting a much larger inﬂuence. As Gomez-Mejia notes: ‘The literature on executive pay is rather extensive . . . However . . . it is amaz- ing how little we know about executive pay in spite of the massive volume of empirical work available on this topic’ (Gomez-Mejia, 1994: 199).

E-mail: jcoombs@richmond.edu compensation may be the ﬁeld’s almost exclusive focus on ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial performance. Several calls have been made for researchers to go beyond ﬁnancial performance and to include additional organizational effectiveness measures when studying strategic management (see Came- ron, 1986; Hillman, Keim, and Luce, 2001). One such measure of organizational effectiveness, stakeholder management (SM), has been explored as a possible outcome of CEO compensation structure (McGuire, Dow, and Argheyd, 2003), but it has been ignored as a possible antecedent. SM deals with the degree to which organizations move beyond their own needs and legal requirements (McWilliams and Siegel, 2001) to satisfy the needs of their various non-shareholding stakeholders such as employees, suppliers, customers, and individuals in the community whose primary beneﬁt derived from the company is not from its shareholder returns. We are aware of no studies that have examined the extent to which top executives are compensated for leading their ﬁrms to higher levels of SM. Thus, the extent to Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Received 19 May 2003 Final revision received 28 February 2005 828 J. E. Coombs and K. M. Gilley remains initiatives which CEOs are rewarded for pursuing stakeholder management an empirical question. Our goal, then, is to advance the ﬁeld of strategic management by developing the argument that SM is likely to affect CEO compensation, both as a main effect and as an interaction effect with ﬁnancial performance. We empirically test these relationships using a sample of 406 Fortune 1000 ﬁrms and their CEOs. LITERATURE REVIEW AND HYPOTHESIS DEVELOPMENT Prior CEO compensation research has relied im- plicitly or explicitly on agency theory to frame discussions and empirical tests (Tosi and Gomez- Mejia, 1989). The most essential agency the- ory component is the principal–agent relationship, whereby the agent (in this case the CEO) con- ducts business on behalf of the organization’s prin- cipals (the owners/shareholders). Principals often ﬁnd it difﬁcult and expensive to monitor agents’ actions, resulting in agency-related costs. Agency theory suggests that compensation should be tied to ﬁnancial performance so that agents are encour- aged to simultaneously maximize ﬁnancial perfor- mance and their own wealth (Stroh et al., 1996). In the absence of such a compensation structure, executives may favor strategic actions designed to increase ﬁrm size and the CEO’s own ﬁnancial rewards, potentially at the cost of proﬁtability and shareholder wealth (Baumol, 1967). When CEO compensation is related to ﬁnancial performance, agency costs are minimized. Results from examinations of the ﬁrm perfor- mance–CEO compensation relationship are sur- prisingly inconsistent with regard to the strength of the relationship. As Tosi et al. (2000) noted, the correlations between ﬁrm performance and CEO compensation in prior research have ranged from 0.41 (Belliveau, O’Reilly, and Wade, 1996) to −0.03 (Finkelstein and Boyd, 1998). Therefore, prior research has found that CEO compensation does not always depend on the extent to which CEOs guide their ﬁrms to superior ﬁnancial per- formance, though the nature of the relationship is generally positive. Prior CEO compensation research has focused, however, almost entirely on the ﬁnancial compo- nent of ﬁrm performance when assessing the ﬁrm relationship. performance–CEO compensation Given the many recent corporate scandals that have rocked Wall Street, it is evident that orga- nizations focusing on ﬁnancial performance at the expense of other organizational effectiveness mea- sures run the risk of long-run declines in their ability to achieve a competitive advantage. Never- theless, management research has thus far largely ignored the extent to which executive compensa- tion systems are structured such that CEOs are given incentives to go beyond ﬁnancial perfor- mance in their decision making. Stakeholder–agency theory and CEO compensation While most prior CEO compensation studies have been founded on agency theory, stakeholder–a- gency theory provides a useful foundation for the study of the effects of SM on CEO compensa- tion. Hill and Jones (1992) developed a view of the agent–principal relationship based on Jensen and Meckling’s (1976) notion that the relationship between managers and stockholders is just one of a series of relationships that form the mod- ern corporation. Particularly relevant here are the unique relationships between managers and the ﬁrm’s stakeholders that form the basis of stake- holder–agency theory. Stakeholders are deﬁned here as those groups or individuals who can affect or are affected by ﬁrm’s actions (Freeman, 1984). This stakeholder deﬁnition is inclusive in nature and covers a broad variety of individuals, groups, and entities, such as shareholders, employees, cus- tomers, suppliers, the community, and the natural environment. CEOs have direct control over ﬁrm-level deci- sions that directly impact all stakeholder groups. Clearly, SM is an important component of organi- zational effectiveness, and it is affected by deci- sions made at the very top of the organization (Jones and Wicks, 1999). Due to this unique rela- tionship, CEOs can be viewed as stakeholders’ agents, not just shareholders’ agents (Hill and Jones, 1992). As agents for all the ﬁrm’s stakehold- ers, CEOs’ actions are monitored and inﬂuenced by the presence of representatives on the board of directors (Harrison, 1987; Luoma and Goodstein, 1999). A stakeholder–agency view would suggest that stakeholder-monitors consider organizational effectiveness to be enhanced when organizations meet the needs of a wide variety of stakeholders Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 827–840 (2005) Stakeholder Management as a Predictor of CEO Compensation 829 (Jawahar and McLaughlin, 2001; Jones, 1995), including both shareholders and non-shareholders. Following prior research in the area (Hillman and Keim, 2001), we examine the ﬁrm’s stake- holder management-related performance with regard to employees (including diversity initia- tives), customers (product safety/quality), the nat- ural environment, the community, and suppliers (to the extent that certain diversity initiatives are directed toward suppliers). We contend that the board of directors compensates CEOs for maxi- mizing value for these stakeholders because, in doing so, such CEOs are enhancing the ﬁrm’s overall effectiveness. Prior research has clearly suggested that incentives should be structured so that organizational performance is a key determi- nant of executive compensation (Tosi et al., 2000). This alignment has been theorized to be critical to maximizing long-run ﬁrm performance, but the focus of prior research has been almost exclusively on ﬁnancial performance. It seems reasonable to suggest, however, that boards of directors recog- nize the value of effective stakeholder management and seek to design executive compensation sys- tems such that CEOs are rewarded for maximizing stakeholder value. Thus: Hypothesis 1: Stakeholder management (SM) will have a positive effect on CEO compensation levels. Interactions between SM and ﬁnancial performance Prior research has consistently suggested that the ﬁrm’s long-run survival depends on its ability to satisfy the needs of its various stakeholders (Clark- son, 1995), beyond just shareholding stakeholders. Organizations maximize their effectiveness when their various stakeholders attain maximum value from the ﬁrm (Donaldson and Preston, 1995). Fur- thermore, by attending to the needs of the orga- nization’s various stakeholders, corporate execu- tives increase the ﬁrm’s performance relative to the desires of a broad base of constituents, while at the same time having fewer resources to devote to self-centered decisions (Hill and Jones, 1992). This suggests that CEOs may beneﬁt their organi- zations by pursuing stakeholder-related initiatives designed to add value for multiple stakeholder groups. Empirical research generally supports this con- clusion. For instance, Hillman and Keim (2001) found a positive relationship between stakeholder management and shareholder value creation. Og- den and Watson (1999) reported that enhancing customer service levels negatively affects short-run accounting returns but signiﬁcantly enhances share price. In addition, Berman et al. (1999) concluded that customer-related and employee-related en- hancements positively affected return on assets. Fi- nally, Waddock and Graves (1997) noted that cor- porate social responsibility was positively related to accounting returns. Boards of directors have generally based CEO compensation partially on the organization’s ﬁnan- cial performance, although the extent to which compensation is based on performance varies from study to study and from ﬁrm to ﬁrm. One poten- tial reason that ﬁrm performance has been found to marginally affect CEO compensation is that researchers have ignored the complex interrelation- ships between different types of organizational per- formance, choosing instead to focus only on ﬁnan- cial outcomes. Although SM and ﬁnancial per- formance are unique dimensions of organizational performance, they are complementary in nature and should both affect CEO compensation. In their study of corporate governance and social respon- sibility, Johnson and Greening (1999) concluded that their ﬁndings highlighted the need for direc- tors to be concerned with both stakeholders’ social goals and stockholders’ proﬁt goals. We believe directors’ concerns for both stakeholders’ social goals and stockholders’ proﬁt goals may take the form of an interaction effect with regard to their inﬂuence on CEO compensation. We contend that the extent to which ﬁnancial performance affects CEO compensation is partly based on the ﬁrm’s stakeholder-related performance, and vice versa. For example, regardless of how highly an organiza- tion may perform on ﬁnancial criteria, those CEOs not meeting non-shareholding stakeholders’ needs may see their compensation adversely affected. The reverse may also be the case: CEOs meeting the needs of their non-shareholding stakeholders, but achieving disappointing ﬁnancial performance, may not be rewarded for their superior leadership on stakeholder-related initiatives. CEOs simultane- ously achieving superior ﬁnancial and stakeholder performance would be compensated most highly. Thus, the effects of ﬁnancial performance on CEO compensation may be contingent on SM, and vice versa. In other words, ﬁrm performance is clearly a multidimensional construct, and CEOs performing Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 827–840 (2005) 830 J. E. Coombs and K. M. Gilley well simultaneously on multiple dimensions will be most highly compensated. Hypothesis 2: Stakeholder management and ﬁ- nancial performance interact to predict CEO compensation levels, such that CEOs simulta- neously achieving higher levels of both will be the most highly compensated. RESEARCH METHOD Sample and data collection To test these hypotheses, we collected SM data from the Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini, and Com- pany (KLD) database. KLD’s data have been widely used in empirical studies in premier man- agement journals over the past several years (see Agle, Mitchell, and Sonnenfeld, 1999; Berman et al., 1999; Graves and Waddock, 1994; Hill- man and Keim, 2001; Johnson and Greening, 1999; Turban and Greening, 1996; Waddock and Graves, 1997). These are considered to be the most comprehensive and prominent data on SM. Ana- lysts at KLD, a social equity fund advisor, col- lected KLD’s stakeholder management data. The database includes all ﬁrms on the Standard and Poor’s 500, as well as approximately 150 ﬁrms included in the Domini Social Index. Firm ﬁnancial performance data and data for ﬁrm-level control variables were taken from the Compustat database, while CEO compensation and characteristics data were drawn from the Exec- ucomp database. Although it is uncertain as to exactly how long it takes SM to affect CEO com- pensation, we believe that a 1-year lag is appro- priate here. The choice of the appropriate lag presented an interesting challenge, in particular because we are aware of no studies that specif- ically address the matter. However, given that CEO compensation is determined annually and is generally based on the ﬁrm’s performance over the prior year, a 1-year lag seems the appropri- ate choice. Indeed, prior research examining the antecedents of CEO compensation has followed a 1-year lag approach (e.g., Balkin, Markman and Gomez-Mejia, 2000). Although a 1-year lag, cou- pled with our longitudinal research design, pro- vides some assurance that reverse causality is not signiﬁcantly affecting our results (Benner and Tushman, 2002), we followed the process outlined by Hillman and Keim (2001) and found little evi- dence of a recursive relationship in a series of additional analyses designed speciﬁcally to test for reverse causality. Data were available for 406 ﬁrms and their CEOs. Firms in the sample represented a total of 47 2-digit SIC code industries and had average 1999 sales of approximately $11 billion. Estimation methods An unbalanced panel data set relating to a sam- ple of ﬁrms for the period 1995–2001 is analyzed. As both ﬁrm-speciﬁc and time-speciﬁc effects are likely to be present, a panel estimation procedure is used (Chamberlain, 1982) including a White heteroskedasticity-consistent variance–covariance matrix (White, 1980). While a ﬁxed-effects speci- ﬁcation is a more conservative approach (Greene, 1995), the analyses include industry control vari- ables that are invariant over time and there- fore necessitate the use of random-effects models (Greene, 1995; Sanders, 2001). The ﬁrm is the primary stratiﬁcation variable, so that there is a 406-item unbalanced panel, with a time series of between three and seven observations in each stra- tum. There are a total of 2297 observations in the panel. Year dummy variables were included to eliminate year-speciﬁc heterogeneity (Bergh, 1993). Measures Dependent variables Our primary dependent variables were the different categories of CEO compensation, including salary, bonus, stock options granted value, and total com- pensation. Stock options were valued using the Black–Scholes options pricing model. The aver- age CEO in our study had total compensation of approximately $6.5 million. Independent variables and moderators Our independent variables were ﬁve types of SM found in the KLD database. Because these mea- sures have been used extensively in prior research, we will only summarize them here. We measured SM as it related to the following: community rela- tions, diversity, employee relations, environmen- tal impact, and product safety/quality (customer related). These ﬁve dimensions best reﬂect a stake- holder view of the organization (Agle et al., 1999). Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 827–840 (2005) Stakeholder Management as a Predictor of CEO Compensation 831 Each ﬁrm’s performance on these dimensions is determined by KLD after extensive investigation of public records, surveys, and even facilities vis- its by the KLD analysts (Berman et al., 1999). After this data collection, ﬁrms are given rat- ings on 5-point Likert-type scales, with a score of −2 suggesting poor social performance and a +2 indicating superior social performance. To test for interaction effects between SM and ﬁnancial performance, we measured ﬁnancial performance using return on assets (following Berman et al., 1999) and total returns to shareholders. Each of these was drawn from the Compustat database for the year prior to our CEO compensation measure. Control variables Several industry-, ﬁrm-, and CEO-speciﬁc con- trol variables used in prior research were included in our study to enhance conﬁdence in our ﬁnd- ings. Prior research has suggested that industry effects may inﬂuence both compensation strate- gies (Gerhart and Milkovich, 1990; Stroh et al., 1996) and stakeholder management (Agle et al., 1999; Hillman and Keim, 2001; Hillman et al., 2001; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Following Hillman and Keim (2001), we therefore created industry dummy variables measured at the 2-digit SIC code level. Firm size was measured by the logarithm of sales following prior CEO compen- sation research using similar samples (Belliveau et al., 1996; Finkelstein and Boyd, 1998; Sanders, 2001; Sanders and Carpenter, 1998). Prior research has shown that ﬁrm size generally has a signif- icant effect on CEO compensation (Tosi et al., 2000), and larger ﬁrms may have lower average costs than smaller ﬁrms when implementing social performance-related initiatives (McWilliams and Siegel, 2001). Thus, ﬁrm size is an important con- trol variable. CEO-related factors included CEO share own- ership and CEO tenure with the current ﬁrm in days. A CEO’s tenure may inﬂuence compen- sation levels because newer CEOs are likely to receive different levels and types of compensation than longer-tenured ones (Hambrick and Finkel- stein, 1995). CEO equity ownership was included as a control variable because it has long been considered an important potential antecedent of CEO compensation (see Finkelstein, 1992). CEO equity ownership was measured as the percentage of shares outstanding owned by the CEO. RESULTS Table 1 reports descriptive statistics and correla- tions for the variables included in this study. On average, CEOs were paid $739,000 in salary and received $986,000 in bonus compensation. Stock options value averaged $4,700,000 while on aver- age CEOs owned 1.5 percent of their ﬁrms. Mul- tiple regression and moderated multiple regression analyses were used to test our hypotheses. The results of these analyses are shown in Tables 2 and 3. To aid in interpreting our interaction results, each variable included in the interaction terms was centered (Aiken and West, 1991). While centering our data helps minimize multicollinearity prob- lems, we tested for the presence of multicollinear- ity in our analyses by examining variance inﬂation factors (VIF). These analyses showed no indication of multicollinearity, thus each of the interaction terms was included in one analysis. Table 2 reports results using ROA as ﬁrm performance, while Table 3 shows our results when ﬁnancial perfor- mance is measured using shareholder returns. Models 1, 4, 7, and 10 of Tables 2 and 3 present our control variable results for salary, bonus, stock options, and total compensation as dependent vari- ables, respectively. Consistent with prior research, ﬁrm size and ﬁnancial performance were both pos- itively associated with each type of compensation. Stock ownership and tenure were negatively asso- ciated with salary, but unrelated to the other forms of compensation. Main effects for each of our SM performance measures are reported in Mod- els 2, 5, 8, and 11 of Tables 2 and 3. The com- munity, diversity, environment, and product per- formance variables were all negative and signif- icant for salary, suggesting that CEOs are given incentives to decrease their focus on stakeholder management. These results refute our prediction in Hypothesis 1 that SM performance would have a positive effect on CEO compensation. Rather, CEOs appear to be given disincentives to engage in stakeholder management issues, at least as far as base salary is concerned. Our results for bonus, stock options, and total compensation as dependent variables yield almost no signiﬁcant effects of SM performance on compensation except for a positive effect of employee-related SM on bonuses. Given the number of relationships we explored, however, this ﬁnding should be viewed with extreme cau- tion. We found no main effect whatsoever of SM on stock options or total compensation in either Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 827–840 (2005) 832 J. E. Coombs and K. M.

Thus, our results indicate a relationship that is the opposite of what was sug- gested in Hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 2 proposed that ﬁnancial perfor- mance and SM interact to predict CEO compen- sation such that CEOs of ﬁrms having higher SM and higher ﬁnancial performance would be most highly compensated. Moderated multiple regres- sion analyses were used to test this hypothesis. We created linear-by-linear interaction terms follow- ing Stone and Hollenbeck (1988) by multiplying ﬁnancial performance (either ROA or 1-year share- holder return) by the ﬁve types of SM. After enter- ing the proposed main effects into the regression model, we then added the multiplicative terms. As with our main effects models, there appears to be a predominantly negative interaction effect of SM and ﬁnancial performance on compensation. Our two types of ﬁnancial performance, ﬁve types of SM, and four types of compensation yielded a total of 40 interaction terms, 12 of which were sig- niﬁcant. Of these 12, eight were in the direction opposite of our hypothesis. SM tended to reduce the positive effects of ﬁnancial performance on the various types of compensation. Consistent patterns were difﬁcult to ﬁnd, however, with regard to a given interaction’s effects across multiple types of compensation, or with respect to the effects of mul- tiple interactions on a single type of compensation. One exception, however, is a negative interaction of community-related SM and shareholder returns on salary, stock options, and total compensation. In sum, we feel that our results should be viewed with caution, with the exception of the negative main effects we found of SM on CEO salaries. DISCUSSION Despite being one of the most highly researched areas in the management ﬁeld, empirical investi- gations of CEO compensation and organizational effectiveness have been limited by researchers’ reliance on ﬁnancial measures of organizational effectiveness. This study’s purpose was to examine the effects of a different organizational effective- ness measure, SM, on CEO compensation. Our main effects models provide evidence that the SM dimensions of community, diversity, environment, and product performance are negatively associ- ated with CEO salaries. These results indicate that a proactive approach to SM on the part of CEOs may negatively affect their personal wealth. Our tests for interactions between SM and ﬁnan- cial performance yielded similar results, though the bulk of the interactions were non-signiﬁcant. Boards apparently give negative reinforcement to their CEOs for engaging in stakeholder value- enhancing initiatives. This may occur because proactive behavior is costly in terms of ﬁnancial and managerial resources (Jawahar and McLaugh- lin, 2001). Our results suggest that boards consider both ﬁnancial and stakeholder-related performance when determining CEO compensation, especially with regard to main effects on salary. Our ﬁnd- ings of a negative SM effect on salary and many negative interactions between SM and ﬁrm ﬁnan- cial performance are interesting in light of John- son and Greening’s (1999) observation that boards are concerned with both stakeholders’ social goals and stockholders’ proﬁt goals. Our results suggest that, to more fully understand the complex rela- tionships between ﬁrm performance and the vari- ous types of CEO compensation, researchers must move beyond ﬁnancial performance and consider a broader view of organizational effectiveness that includes different dimensions of social (Freeman, 1984; Hillman et al., 2001) and innovative (Balkin et al., 2000) performance. Although the results of our moderated multi- ple regression models should be interpreted with caution, several observations can be made. Results suggest that CEOs who simultaneously maximize environment-related SM and ﬁnancial performance may be rewarded with greater salaries, while CEOs maximizing diversity-related SM and ﬁnancial per- formance may be rewarded with higher bonuses. The diversity results are consistent with prior research that has clearly explicated a positive con- nection between diversity and ﬁnancial perfor- mance outcomes (Richard, 2000). We also found evidence that the interaction of diversity-related SM and ROA was negatively related to salaries, which is consistent with CEO risk aversion asso- ciated with ﬁxed compensation (Jensen and Mur- phy, 1990; McGuire et al., 2003; Zajac and West- phal, 1994). Our positive results for CEOs achiev- ing greater levels of ﬁnancial and environment- related SM appear inconsistent with prior ﬁndings by Mathur and Mathur (2000) and Gilley et al. (2000). Interestingly, a CEO’s salary for achieving greater shareholder return appears to be reduced those CEOs focusing on employee-related for Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt.

This result supports research that has found positive market reactions to announcements of union de-certiﬁcation petitions and elections (Huth and MacDonald, 1990). Finally, consistent with CEO risk aversion toward ﬁxed compensation, the interaction of ﬁnancial performance (measured by ROA) and product performance is negatively asso- ciated with CEO salary compensation. Hillman and Keim (2001) suggest it would be beneﬁcial for researchers to more fully understand how managers prioritize and manage stakeholder demands. With few exceptions our results sug- gest that CEOs are given negative signals from boards of directors with regard to enhancing ﬁrm value to its various stakeholders. CEOs do appear to be rewarded (through bonus compensation) for employee-related SM performance, but again this ﬁnding should be viewed with caution. These ﬁndings indicate, however, that boards generally punish stakeholder-related managerial initiatives. This conclusion not only affects CEO compen- sation in isolation, but also affects the extent to which CEOs are rewarded for ﬁnancial perfor- mance itself. Therefore, is likely that CEOs will respond to this incentive system in a way that maximizes their own rewards, often at the expense of the organization’s various stakeholder groups. it Limitations and future research An important research limitation is the lack of attention to the complex relationships among board members and between the board and the CEO that ultimately determine CEO compensation. We have taken a more coarse-grained approach by using CEO compensation as a proxy for those behav- iors that boards are rewarding. Researchers should extend this line of inquiry by collecting primary data from directors, especially those serving on compensation committees, dealing with the extent to which they value and reward SM-related behav- iors on the part of their ﬁrm’s CEO. Our ﬁndings’ generalizability is also somewhat limited. Given that our sample consisted only of the largest publicly held companies in the United States, it remains uncertain whether our results are generalizable to smaller public ﬁrms, private ﬁrms, non-proﬁt and government agency executives, and ﬁrms outside the United States. These limitations may partially explain the relatively small amount of bonus, stock option, and total compensation variation we are able to explain. Our results suggest several avenues for clarify- ing the relationship between organizational perfor- mance and CEO compensation. First, researchers should take care to separate salary and contingent compensation. Researchers have often combined these types of compensation to form a single mea- sure (Geletkanycz, Boyd, and Finkelstein, 2001; Henderson and Fredrickson, 1996). Our results show that the organizational effectiveness mea- sures used in this study have very different rela- tionships with ﬁxed vs. contingent compensa- tion, likely due to CEO risk aversion (Jensen and Murphy, 1990; McGuire et al., 2003; Zajac and Westphal, 1994). Second, researchers should expand their conception of organization perfor- mance to include variables beyond ﬁnancial per- formance such as innovative (Balkin et al., 2000), social, and diversiﬁcation performance. Finally, research clarifying board member attitudes toward SM would beneﬁt our understanding of the induce- ments and corporate governance. to satisfy stakeholders CONCLUSION This paper has extended research into CEO com- pensation antecedents by examining the extent to which America’s top executives are rewarded or punished for pursuing stakeholder-related initia- tives. Our results provide evidence that the main effects of SM on CEO compensation are more often negative than positive, and that the only form of compensation substantially affected by SM is salary. Our results also suggest that the interaction effects between ﬁnancial performance and SM were generally negative. We therefore conclude that social performance is relevant to compensation committees when setting CEO com- pensation, and that CEOs are typically dissuaded from pursuing stakeholder-related initiatives.
