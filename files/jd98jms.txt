Journal of Management Studies 35:2 March 1998 0022-2380 PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS OF INCORPORATING NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES INTO THE STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS: AN EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENT* WILLIAM Q. JUDGE, JR THOMAS J. DOUGLAS University of Tennessee ABSTRACT This paper explores the ability of ﬁrms to integrate a critical strategic issue, the natural environment, into the strategic planning process within the natural resource-based perspective. Using survey data collected from a wide variety of ﬁrms and industries based in the United States, we empirically examined the antecedents and e ects of integrating the natural environment into the formal planning process. These data were analysed using structural equation modelling with the LISREL technique. Overall, our data provided strong support for the hypothesized relationships. Speciﬁcally, we found that the level of integration of environmental management concerns in the strategic planning process was positively related to ﬁnancial and environmental performance. Furthermore, we found that the functional coverage and the more resources provided to environmental issues, the greater the integration of environmental issues in the planning process. These results suggest that concern for environmental issues may yield competitive advan- tages in the marketplace as the natural resource-based perspective suggests. the greater INTRODUCTION Many ﬁrms have discovered that the natural environment is a critically important strategic issue. For example, a 1991 survey conducted by Booz-Allen and Hamilton showed that 67 per cent of the senior executives of major companies issues to be ‘extremely important’ to their company considered environmental (Newman and Breeden, 1992). That these major companies spend approximately 2 per cent of their sales on environmental consid- erations. Similarly, in another recent survey of large American manufacturers, 94 per cent of the respondents rated environmental issues as strategically ‘critical’ or ‘important’ (McKee, 1991). same survey found that Some companies are responding to the challenges posed by the natural environ- ment by integrating it into their strategic management processes.

DOUGLAS Taylor (1992), based on his interviews with 16 senior executives, found that some of the ﬁrms were seeking to gain competitive advantages by incorporating environ- mental issues into their business strategies. Also, Barrett (1991, 1992) and Dean and Brown (1995) suggested that increasing numbers of ﬁrms were creating competitive advantages by working to inﬂuence environmental regulations. Finally, some executives are responding to environmental issues simply because they believe that it is the right thing to do (Stead and Stead, 1992). Increasing numbers of executives acknowledge that economic activity a ects the environment and their values force them to integrate concern for economic growth with care for the environment. Under the rubric of ‘sustainable development’, these execu- tives seek to ensure that economic activity limits or eliminates damage to our natural resources (Greeno and Robinson, 1992; Schmidheiny, 1990). As a result, these corporations are better able to meet the needs of all their stakeholders (Hutchinson, 1992). One of in their the primary ways that ﬁrms respond to new strategic issues is to integrate those issues into their formal strategic planning process (Anso  and McDonnell, 1990; Lorange et al., 1986; Steiner, 1979). For example, one set of issues that has received increasing attention by those involved with the strategic planning process relates to global business (Ghoshal, 1987). An illustration of this would be the Shell Oil Corporation’s routine inclusion of global business parameters (deGuess, 1988). Similarly, technology issues are increasingly being examined within a planning context (Friar and Horwich, 1986). For example, executives at Merck routinely incorporate information about new biotechnology developments into their planning process (Nichols, 1994). A third example, and one that is central to this paper, consists of the General Motors Corporation issues posed by environment. For example, recently integrated environmental strategic planning process (General Motors, 1994) and this has resulted in improved ﬁnancial and environ- mental performance. strategic planning process issues into its Due to the emerging nature of the environment as a strategic issue, work has only begun to investigate the conceptual linkages between strategic management and the environment (e.g. Hart and Ahuja, 1994; Shrivastava and Hart, 1992; Stead and Stead, 1992). While these conceptual e orts have been essential, there has been a dearth of empirical studies on how organizations are responding to this new strategic issue. Consequently, this study empirically examines the antecedents and e ects of incorporating the environment into the strategic planning process. THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT To better understand the antecedents and e ects of incorporating the natural environment into the strategic planning process, we used the planning-perfor- mance literature and the resource-based perspective (Wernerfelt, 1984). The resource-based perspective argues that competitive advantage and superior ﬁrm rents are dependent on the unique assembly of internal resources and capabilities which are valuable, rare, and imperfectly inimitable relative to an organization’s competitors and which mitigate threats posed by the external environment (Barney, 1991). # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998 INCORPORATING NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 243 The resource-based perspective has generated a productive dialogue among previously isolated perspectives (Conner, 1991; Mahoney and Pandian, 1992). For instance, Powell (1992b) used the resource view of the ﬁrm to clarify the relation- ship between strategic planning and performance that had evolved over many years. An interesting new extension of the resource-based perspective has linked concern for the natural environment to the resource-based view. Hart (1995) argued that due to increasing awareness of constraints imposed by the natural environment, pollution prevention, product stewardship, and sustainable develop- ment will increasingly be sources of competitive advantage. He called this perspec- tive the ‘natural’ resource-based view of the ﬁrm and argued that we need to expand our considerations of ﬁrm performance to include environmental as well as ﬁnancial dimensions. Central to his argument was that natural resources will be increasingly constrained in the future and those ﬁrms that better handle this constraint will command a sustainable competitive advantage. Furthermore, Hart also theorized that a ﬁrm’s ability to deal with the natural environment could be developed into an organizational capability. The capabilities of the organization ‘refer to a ﬁrm’s capacity to deploy resources, usually in combi- nation, using organizational processes to e ect a desired end’ (Amit and Schoe- maker, 1993, p. 35). Hart argued that dealing with natural environmental issues was a complex, social (i.e. tacit) process with which increasing numbers of ﬁrms must address. Therefore, the ability to integrate the natural environment into the strategic planning process o ers a ﬁrm the opportunity to develop a valuable, potentially rare, and not easily imitated organizational capability. integrating environmental For this study, we test the theoretical assumption that ﬁrms that have better developed the capability of issues into the strategic planning process will yield superior ﬁnancial and social outcomes. Recent work by Russo and Fouts (1997) suggests that this theoretical framework will be productive. We examine how this level of integration inﬂuences ﬁnancial and environmental performance; and we explore several antecedents that may drive this integration e ort. Outcomes of Integrating the Natural Environment into Strategic Planning Amit and Schoemaker (1993) distinguish between organizational capabilities and organizational resources. This distinction is important, since many ﬁrms may possess certain ﬁnancial, physical, or human resources, but it is the ability to combine these resources using knowledge and skills that may render these capabilities tacit and/or socially complex, potentially leading to competitive advantage (Grant, 1991). Ramanujam et al. described strategic planning processes as ‘multifaceted systems that are contextually embedded’ (1986, p. 348). Successful integration of an important, external issue such as the natural environment into such a process can be viewed as the development of a capability as deﬁned by the resource-based perspective. Since the planning process can have multiple ‘desired ends’ (Ramanujam et al., 1986; Steiner, 1979), both ﬁnancial and environmental outcomes will be addressed. Financial outcomes. The strategic planning system does not consume many physical resources within a ﬁrm, but it does consume considerable executive time # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998 244 WILLIAM Q. JUDGE AND THOMAS J. DOUGLAS and it does inﬂuence major resource investments within the ﬁrm. Consequently, the strategic planning process can have a material impact on the ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance (Miller and Cardinal, 1994). Previous research using the resource- based perspective has shown that the strategic planning system can yield favour- able performance outcomes if its existence within an industry is not ubiquitous (Powell, 1992b). Extending that logic, ﬁrms may be able to create competitive advantages by incorporating the natural environment into their strategic planning system better than other ﬁrms within their industry. Fineman and Clarke (1996) did ﬁnd that ﬁrms often include environmental issues in their planning processes, therefore the important question concerns the e ect of this capability. There are two basic reasons which support this logic within the management literature. First, the environment is signiﬁcantly threatening the cost structure of many businesses (Makower, 1993). Some of this increase in cost is derived from the growth and complexity of federal and state environmental regulations. These regulations are increasingly raising the standards for environmental compliance and, as a result, this requires correspondingly more management attention, capital, and technical resources to address these rising standards. For example, is estimated that pollution prevention equipment will cost American businesses $160 billion in 1995 (Sullivan, 1992). Furthermore, there is often a real or potential cost of legal liability due to environmental problems (Greeno and Robinson, 1992; Hunt and Auster, 1990). it An additional source of cost (1996) is due to unnecessary waste. Because of in redesigning production systems to reduce waste, the increasing interest ‘green’ technologies are beginning to emerge and signiﬁcant environmental and economic waste streams are being reduced or eliminated (Vandermere and Oli , 1990). In fact, Nehrt found that ﬁrst-mover ﬁrms that adopted new pollution- reducing technologies displayed stronger net income growth than other interna- tional ﬁrms in the chemical bleached paper pulp manufacturing industry. In addition, ﬁrms are reducing waste and hence cost through the usage of environ- mentally ‘safe substitutes’ (Welter, 1991). Furthermore, some ﬁrms are reducing waste and cost by inﬂuencing suppliers and buyers (Kirkpatrick, 1990). In sum, issues associated with the environment pose a considerable external threat to increasing numbers of businesses through their impact on the cost of doing business, and ﬁrms that have successfully responded to these issues have gained competitive advantage. Second, the natural environment sometimes o ers signiﬁcant new business opportunities (Cairncross, 1992). For example, some ﬁrms are discovering that by modifying the inputs, throughputs, and/or outputs of their systems, they can di erentiate their goods and services from the competition and thereby gain a competitive advantage. Notably, consumers report that they are willing to pay 6.6 per cent price premiums (Roper, 1990). In consumer markets, ‘green’ products constituted 13.4 per cent of all new product introductions in 1991, up from 0.5 per cent in 1985 (Ottman, 1992). There are even some arguments that properly designed environmental regulations can spur corporate innovations and create new markets (Hart, 1995; Porter and Van der Linde, 1995). As a result, some ﬁrms are gaining competi- tive advantages by proactively addressing environmental issues. for environmentally friendly products Therefore, we would expect that the more that natural environmental concerns # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998 INCORPORATING NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 245 are integrated into the strategic planning process, the better the ﬁnancial perfor- mance of the ﬁrm. In other words, ﬁrms that prove more adept than their compe- titors at developing this ﬁrm capability that allows them to manage the tradeo between environmental beneﬁts and costs should experience relatively better performance, all other factors being equal (Wally and Whitehead, 1994). Hart (1995) has noted that the capability of pollution prevention is tacit and, hence, hard for competitors to copy. The basic argument for the expectation of superior performance is that, by lacking this important capability concerning natural envir- onmental issues, signiﬁcant costs are incurred or major opportunities are missed (Stead and Stead, 1992, 1995). Consequently, we would expect a positive relation- ship between the capability of integrating environmental issues into the strategic planning process and ﬁnancial performance. Hypothesis 1: There will be a positive relationship between the level of integra- tion of environmental issues into the strategic planning process and the ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance. outcomes. Apart Environmental from the ﬁnancial beneﬁts of developing this capability of integrating environmental issues into the strategic planning process, some management scholars argue that the ﬁrm has a societal duty also to attend to the environmental performance of the ﬁrm (Starik and Rands, 1995; Stead and Stead, 1992, 1995). We deﬁne environmental performance as a ﬁrm’s e ec- tiveness in meeting and exceeding society’s expectations with respect to concerns for the natural environment. This desired end would extend beyond mere compliance with existing regulations to a proactive stance concerning future environmental considerations. Gilbert and Freeman (1988) argued that strategic decision makers have an ethical responsibility to care for many stakeholders, including ‘mother’ earth, as they form their strategies. Shrivastava (1995) also discusses the stark result of taking a ‘denatured’ approach to organizational outcomes. As a result, the envir- onmental performance of the ﬁrm is another critical dimension of organizational e ectiveness which needs to be considered from a larger, societal perspective (Andrews, 1987; Hart and Ahuja, 1994). Consistent with this societal obligation is the recent development in the strategic management literature that encourages multiple measures of organiza- tional performance. For example, Judge and Krishnan (1994) found that di erent corporate strategies were associated with di erent types of ﬁnancial and non- ﬁnancial organizational performance levels. Similarly, Judge (1994) found that di erent organizational contexts and managerial skills produced di erent ﬁnancial and social performance outcomes. Notably, the need to satisfy multiple stake- holders has been advanced as a key reason to use multiple measures of organiza- tional e ectiveness (Chakravarthy, 1986; Judge and Fowler, 1994; Venkatraman and Ramanujam, 1986). Therefore, strategic planning can and should have an impact beyond the ﬁnancial performance of the ﬁrm (Ramanujam et al., 1986). Based on this logic, it stands to reason that the more that environmental issues are incorporated into the strategic planning process, the better and more compre- hensive is the information existing for top managers to care for the environment (Stead and Stead, 1995). Developing this capability of incorporating environmental # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998 246 WILLIAM Q. JUDGE AND THOMAS J. DOUGLAS issues in the planning process allows environmental champions to assert themselves (Winn, 1995). Fineman and Clarke (1996) demonstrated the importance of such champions in contributing to a ﬁrm’s environmental actions. Furthermore, the development of this capability signals to the rest of the organization what is valued and important (Anso  and Brandenburg, 1967; Quinn, 1980; Reid, 1989). Conse- quently, this signalling device can focus employee time and attention on the envir- onmental performance of the ﬁrm. In sum, we would expect that the greater the integration of environmental issues into the strategic planning process, the better the environmental performance of the ﬁrm. Hypothesis 2: There will be a positive relationship between the level of integra- tion of environmental issues into the strategic planning process and the ﬁrm’s environmental performance. Antecedents of Level of Integration of Environmental Issues The resource-based perspective argues that unique combinations of ﬁrm resources raise barriers to imitation and hence create competitive advantages (Rumelt, 1984). Resource investment decisions are clearly strategic in nature. With respect to this study, one key determinant of the ﬁrm’s ability to develop this capability within the planning process is the ‘level of resources provided’ to that process (Ramanujam et al., 1986). In fact, Ramanujam et al. identify ‘resources provided’ as one of the two key dimensions for the e ectiveness of a planning system ‘in the broadest sense’ (1986, p. 366). As a result, the natural resource-based perspective predicts that the level of resources provided to natural environmental issues into the strategic planning process is an essential antecedent variable. Speciﬁcally, when resources are invested to track and address environmental issues, the planning literature suggests that the ﬁrms are more likely to integrate environmental issues into its planning system (Lorange, 1980; Ramanujam et al., 1986; Robinson and Pearce, 1988; Steiner, 1979). In contrast, minimal invest- ments in resources to cover environmental issues should limit the level of integra- tion into the planning process, and thus this capability. In other words, investment in natural environmental issues should create a need to obtain a ‘return’ on that investment by integrating it into the strategic planning process. This suggests the following relationship. Hypothesis 3: There will be a positive relationship between the amount of resources provided to attend to natural environmental issues and the level of integration of environmental issues into the strategic planning process. The resource-based perspective also argues that the unique combination of organi- zational resources deﬁnes the ‘resource bundle’ which ultimately determines the ﬁrm’s performance level (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1991). Viewed as ‘invisible assets’ (Itami, 1987), these capabilities are often the result of ‘an integra- tion of individual functional capabilities’ (Grant, 1991, p. 121) at the corporate level in addition to the level of resources, the resource of conﬁguration also determines the e ectiveness of the capability (Black and Boal, 1994). (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993). Therefore, # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998 INCORPORATING NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 247 the primary conﬁgurational feature of Within the planning literature, the strategic planning process is the ‘degree of functional integration’ which is deﬁned as the degree to which the strategic planning process is integrated with di erent functional requirements from a general management perspective. Ramanujam et al. (1986) found that the degree of functional integration was the second most important determinant of planning process e ectiveness. This variable is essential to our study because environmental in nature (Shrivastava and Hart, 1992; Taylor, 1992). issues are often multi-functional Indeed, others have found that proper functional coverage is necessary for success (Hitt et al., 1982; Lorange, 1980; Snow and Hrebiniak, 1980). The logic of this relationship is that ‘functional silos’ obstruct e ective strategic decision making and action. In contrast, when a ﬁrm is functionally integrated, it is more collabora- tive in information sharing and more cohesive in its organizational behaviour. This suggests the more that environmental issues are integrated into the various functional areas, the more that environmental issues will be integrated into the strategic planning process due to the superior cross-functional communication and information ﬂow that exists. Stated more formally: Hypothesis 4: There will be a positive relationship between the degree of func- tional coverage of natural environmental issues and the level of integration of environmental issues into the strategic planning process. An overall model of the relationships described above is o ered in ﬁgure 1. Speciﬁcally, this model graphically depicts the theoretical paths between the Figure 1.

DOUGLAS antecedents of the development of the capability of integrating environmental issues into the strategic planning process (functional coverage and resources provided) as well as the e ects of this capability on the ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial and envir- onmental performance. By empirically examining this model, we expect to reﬁne and extend our understanding of the strategic planning process as well as environ- mental management. METHODOLOGY Data Collection A questionnaire was sent to 725 environmental executives from US-based ﬁrms selected at random from the 1992 World Environmental Directory’s listing of corporate environmental o(cid:129)cers. The sampling frame represented a population of ﬁrms of various size, with the smallest having only 20 employees to the largest with 430,000. The median size of organizations studied was 6,000 employees. These ﬁrms represent companies that have shown interest in environmental management at least from the standpoint of appointing an environmental o(cid:129)cer. Henriques and Sadorsky (1995) have demonstrated a very strong positive relationship between the establishment of a position such as an environmental o(cid:129)cer and the formulation of an environmental plan of action. Since the purpose of this study is to evaluate the integration of environmental issues into the strategic planning process, this set of companies and industries seems appropriate. The respondents reported that their companies were active in over 300 primary industries ranging from chemicals to paper products, with multiple entries possible. The industry most common to our respondents was the chemical industry, but it accounted for only 14 per cent of the responses. As might be expected, the indus- tries in our study contain the ones that have been most a ected by environmental regulations. There were 217 responses, resulting in a response rate of approximately 30 per cent. The sample was reduced to 196 usable responses by dropping the 20 surveys that were completed by individuals who worked in other than the corporate or divisional o(cid:129)ces of the ﬁrm. This was done to ensure that the respondents were associated with a level within the company that would be expected to engage in strategic planning. To test for non-response bias, a sample (n = 49) was randomly selected from the non-respondents and was used to provide comparative statistics to the sampled ﬁrms for which the same data could be obtained. The mean results of the non- respondents (19,778 employees; $7.1 billion in assets; 4.0 per cent ROS; 2.7 per cent ROA) compares favourably to the mean sample results (19,902 employees; $7.3 billion in assets; 4.4 per cent ROS; 2.4 per cent ROA). As a result, there does not appear to be any response bias based on multiple measures of size or proﬁt- ability. To encourage participation and provide some beneﬁt to the respondents, an executive summary of the survey responses was o ered to all the participants. The majority of the participants requested this summary and it was delivered several months after the completion of the survey. # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998 INCORPORATING NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 249 Variables and Measures Functional coverage. Similar to Ramanujam et al. (1986, p. 350) we deﬁned func- tional coverage as ‘the extent of environmental coverage given to di erent func- tional areas with a view to integrating di erent functional requirements’. We operationalized this construct using a four-point Likert scale across seven func- tional areas of the ﬁrm. The scale is listed in the appendix. These seven func- tional areas were chosen in order to represent the key elements of the value chain (Porter, 1985) that had the potential to be most involved in an organiza- tion’s activities with respect to environmental issues. The items measuring this latent construct of functional coverage were combined using a structural equation measurement model. This technique was used for all multi-item constructs. The composite reliability index for the scale in this study was 0.72, which is accepta- ble for this study. The composite reliability index is used to assess the internal consistency of in a structural equation measurement model (Medsker et al., 1994). It is analogous to coe(cid:129)cient alpha. the indicators Resources provided. This construct represented the level of commitment of organi- zational resources to issues related to the environment and its speciﬁc measure- ment is listed in the appendix. This variable captures the notion that adequate resources must be committed to the planning of an activity for it to be successful (Ramanujam et al., 1986; Steiner, 1979). Since resource allocation is a strategic decision (Chandler, 1962; Quinn, 1980; Steiner, 1979), the commitment of funds is reﬂective of the extent to which the ﬁrm is providing ﬁnancial, physical and human resources to an issue such as the environment. issues integration. We deﬁned this construct as the organization’s Environmental into the strategic capability to incorporate issues related to the environment planning process. This concept goes beyond mere compliance with environmental regulations and includes activities that also measure the proactiveness of the orga- nization with respect to this issue. We operationalized this construct with a ﬁve- point Likert scale across four items. The scale is listed in the appendix. These items were derived from the emerging environmental management literature (Greeno and Robinson, 1992; Hunt and Auster, 1990; Newman and Breeden, 1992). The composite reliability index for this scale in the study was 0.90. Financial performance. Financial performance is a construct emphasizing the proﬁt- ability and growth of the ﬁrm. To measure this construct, we used a set of well- established perceptual measures of ﬁnancial performance from the literature, asking each respondent to rate their organization’s performance in four categories relative to other ﬁrms in their industry. Since industry e ects on performance have been shown to be signiﬁcant (Rumelt, 1991; Schmalensee, 1985), and our sample contained multiple industries, for industry di erences in the level of performance using this relative measure. This approach is seen as a necessary proxy for the evaluation of competitive advantage in the resource-based research (Montgomery and Wernerfelt, 1988; Powell, 1995). The measures in our study were taken from Miller and Friesen (1984), but highly similar variations of these items can be found in the planning and resource-based it was necessary to control # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998 250 WILLIAM Q. JUDGE AND THOMAS J. DOUGLAS literature (e.g. Boyd, 1991; Powell, 1995; Ramanujam et al., 1986). The actual scale used is given in the appendix. The composite reliability index for the scale in this study was 0.85. The use of perceived performance data is well established in the literature (Covin et al., 1994; Dess, 1987; Lawrence and Lorsch, 1967; Miller and Cardinal, 1994; Powell, 1992a). Given the heterogeneous sample used in our analysis and the potential for signiﬁcantly di erent accounting and investment adjustments during the time period in this study, the use of perceptual instead of archival data is preferred (Powell, 1995). Indeed, we concur with Jacobsen (1987) when he concluded that ‘(a) ‘‘true’’ measure of economic return for a grouping of assets, such as a ﬁrm, is quite elusive’ (p. 471). Furthermore, Miller and Cardinal (1994) provide a potential reason for a preferred reliance on perceptual performance data, stating: ‘It may be that informant data, which individuals typically give under conditions of promised anonymity for their ﬁrms, basically reﬂect true performance, but archival data to a substantial degree reﬂect public relations, tax, and other extraneous considerations that create noise in the data’ (p. 1661). None the less, we were curious what the relationship was between perceived and archival ﬁnancial performance data. To address this issue of the relationship between perceptual and archival ﬁnancial performance data, Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Sales (ROS) data were obtained for a subset of the public companies in the sample from Compact Disclosure for the years 1992–1994. Very quickly we came to see the problems with using archival performance measures on a number of fronts. First, only one-quarter of our sample contained publicly available ﬁnancial data. Clearly, this omission of three-quarters of our respondents without publicly available data would limit the generalizability of our study. Second, it was not possible to determine the precise industry that the respon- dent used to evaluate their relative performance when completing the survey. Did they respond based on the primary four-digit SIC industry associated with their corporation, with a secondary industry based on the corporate division that they represented, or a subset of the industry leaders with whom they were competing? Realizing that our ability to match the various response options was limited, we opted to adjust each ﬁrm’s ROA and ROS value by subtracting the mean ROA and ROS value associated with their primary four-digit SIC. Third, it was noted that major accounting adjustments were made in the 1992– 1994 time period. For example, during this period major corporations were required to adopt Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, ‘Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Beneﬁts Other Than Pension’, which resulted in large one time adjustments to net income. As a result, the respondents are in a more informed position to factor these complexities into their assessments. In spite of these potential problems, the correlations associated with our percep- tual measure of ﬁnancial performance and ROA (r = .26, p 5 .05) and ROS (r = .26, p 5 .05) respectively, were signiﬁcant, although somewhat lower than desired. In sum, level of correlation between perceptual measures and archival measures of ﬁnancial performance are similar to other studies and it remains unclear which is more accurate (Miller and Cardinal, 1994; Powell, 1995). However, since our data set using perceptual measures of perfor- mance is far more complete than the one that would only use archival data, its use is preferred. this positive and signiﬁcant # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998 INCORPORATING NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 251 Environmental performance. Environmental performance was conceptualized as organization-wide commitment to environmental excellence relative to the rest of the industry in a variety of areas. Similar to the environmental integration measure, we derived these items from the emerging environmental management literature (Hart and Ahuja, 1994; Shrivastava and Hart, 1992; Stead and Stead, 1995), and they are consistent with the arguments of Lober in terms of using multiple criteria to ‘measure the greenness of a company’ (1996, p. 197). The scale is listed in the appendix. Similar to the ﬁnancial performance measures, all of these measures were obtained relative to other ﬁrms in their relevant industry. The composite reliability index of the scale for this study was 0.90. Firm size. Previous studies have shown that ﬁrm size a ects the sophistication of the strategic planning process as well as organizational e ectiveness (Boyd, 1991; Robinson and Pearce, 1983). Since one of the key purposes of strategic planning is to integrate and control the various parts of the ﬁrm, this beneﬁt is seen as more valuable to large ﬁrms than small ones (Miller and Cardinal, 1994). Therefore, the natural logarithm of the number of employees (Powell, 1992b) in the study ﬁrms was included in the model in order to account for this potentially confounding factor. This measure was obtained from archival sources. Data Analysis Having followed Boyd’s (1991) recommendations concerning the multi-dimension- ality of both the planning and performance constructs, we also followed his analy- tical approach recommendation by using a structural equation model. Structural equation models are able to incorporate estimates of measurement error into the study with the result of reducing possible bias in the parameter estimates via the use of multiple indicators. Therefore, LISREL 7.2 was used to perform the necessary structural equation estimations in our study. LISREL is an analysis procedure that combines path analysis with factor and multiple regression analyses (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1989). RESULTS Table I provides the standardized factor loadings for the measurement model. All of the loadings are greater than .4 except the accounting/ﬁnance (.375) and legal indicator variables associated with Functional Coverage, and the market (.388) share change (.356) indicator variable associated with Financial Performance. Since the composite reliability indices estimated for these sets of variables were high, we elected to retain all of the indicators. Table II presents the means, standard deviations, and correlations of the measurement variables. All of the correlations between the independent variables are low or moderate suggesting that multicollinearity is not a problem. In addition, frequency tables were produced for each of the items in the survey. This was done to ensure that the scales were being fully utilized by the respondents, ensuring that the scales were adequately representing the concepts in the study. No problems were noted in our analysis of the descriptive data. The results of the full structural model are presented in ﬁgure 2. The correla- # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998 252 WILLIAM Q.

Since we used the standardized solution for this stage of the model, the latent variable means and standard deviations are 0 and 1 respectively. In general, there was a good ﬁt within the overall model. In this case, the ﬁt of the model was tested using the Noncentralized Normed Fit Index (NCNFI), which was suggested by Bentler (1990) as the test that was least a ected by potential bias in the chi- square values (w2 = 334.81, 184 df, p = .000). Values of NCNFI can realistically range from 0 to 1, with values closest to 1 representing the best ﬁt (Marsh et al., 1988). The value of NCNFI calculated in this study was .87, which seems to represent a su(cid:129)ciently good ﬁt of the data. An additional measure of ﬁt, the Relative Normed Fit Index (RNFI), has been suggested to assess the ﬁt of the latent model separately from that of the measure- ment model (Medsker et al., 1994; Mulaik et al., 1989). The value of RNFI calcu- lated for this study is .91, which represents relatively good ﬁt for the portion of the model that tests the hypotheses. Also, to identify speciﬁcation of measurement errors, we used the root–mean– squared residual (RMSR), a measure of average residual error. The closer this value is to 0, the less the error, with a rule of thumb that a value less than or # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998 Table II.

Research Findings As suggested from the LISREL model, level of integration of environmental issues into the strategic planning process was positively related to ﬁnancial and environ- mental performance. Speciﬁcally, level of integration and ﬁnancial performance had a standardized coe(cid:129)cient of .265 and was signiﬁcant at the .01 level. This ﬁnding supports hypothesis 1. In addition, level of integration and environmental performance had a standardized coe(cid:129)cient of .588 and was also signiﬁcant at the .01 level. Consequently, our data provide evidence to support hypothesis 2 as well. integration, we found that resources Regarding the antecedents of level of # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998 INCORPORATING NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 255 provided was positively associated with level of integration as hypothesized (t = 6.08, p 5 .01). Furthermore, functional integration was also positively related to level of integration (t = 3.17, p 5 .01). In sum, our data also provide support for hypotheses 3 and 4. DISCUSSION All four of our hypotheses were supported by the data in the study. As a result, our study o ers relatively strong support for the natural resource-based perspective advanced by Hart (1995) who argued that ﬁrms will be increasingly constrained and dependent upon the natural environment. Hart (1995) predicted that the development of a pollution-prevention capability would result in lower relative costs and emissions. The data in our study seem to support this expectation. Based on our study, it appears that ﬁrms that provide su(cid:129)cient resources and successfully co-ordinate their strategy across relevant functions are better able to integrate environmental issues into the strategic planning process. This ﬁnding supports the notion that speciﬁc strategic issues can be programmed into the strategic planning process so that e ective and co-ordinated action can take place (Anso  and Brandenburg, 1967; Lorange, 1980; Mintzberg, 1981, 1994). The ﬁndings also support the work of Ramanujam et al. (1986) with respect to substan- tiating the planning dimensions of functional coverage and resource commitment within the context of dealing with the strategic implications of natural environ- mental issues. Our ﬁndings raise some interesting questions about the long-term sustain- ability of those competitive advantages. For example, Powell (1992b) found that the strategic planning process only yielded competitive advantage in industries where planning had not been universally adopted. Similarly, Nehrt (1996) found that ﬁrst movers in the adoption of new pollution-reducing technologies were granted sustainable competitive advantage. Thus, there may be some ﬁrst-mover advantages to integrating the natural environment into the strategic planning process. However, it isn’t clear what the long-term advantages of this integration are. We simply do not know how tacit or embedded the integration of environmental issues into the strategic planning process is. Theory predicts that the more embedded that integration is, the greater and more sustainable the competitive advantage. Only a longitudinal study can help us answer this question of sustainability. With respect to performance, our study supports both the planning and resource-based literatures. First, we found a relationship between planning sophis- tication and performance as described by Boyd (1991). Speciﬁcally, we found positive relationships between level of integration of environmental issues into the strategic planning process and both ﬁnancial and environmental performance. Second, the study discovered that a tacit, hard-to-imitate capability that mitigated an important external threat was related to competitive advantage as expected by the resource-based theory of the ﬁrm (Barney, 1991; Conner, 1991). While the causal linkages between these constructs are unknown and these ﬁndings are tentative, it is encouraging that our results ﬁt with the theoretical predictions. Nevertheless, there are certain limitations to this study which must be consid- # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998 256 WILLIAM Q. JUDGE AND THOMAS J. DOUGLAS ered. First, all of our data were self-reported by the participating ﬁrms. While we took great pains to establish the reliability and validity of our data and we did survey the senior-most individual responsible for environmental issues within the top management team, we simply do not know if these measures can be general- ized to the entire organization. In addition, while we found no evidence of response bias in terms of the company characteristics for the respondents versus the non-respondents, this does not guarantee that there would not be a di erence in the non-respondents’ answers to the survey questions. Future research is needed with similar measures addressed by multiple respondents in di erent industries to replicate our ﬁndings. It would also be desirable to use multiple items to measure the concept of resources provided in order to capture its complexity. Second, like so much of the data used in organizational science, our data are cross-sectional. As a result, we theoretically assume the causal relationships, but do not test them directly. Consequently, it is possible that higher levels of ﬁnancial and/or environmental performance lead to more slack, which permits greater integration of environmental issues into the strategic planning process. Notably, recent research by Henriques and Sadorsky (1995) has revealed that prior organiza- tional performance was not predictive of subsequent environmental planning. Their research, coupled with our research ﬁndings, suggest that environmental planning is more of an antecedent of organizational performance than a derivative outcome. Clearly, longitudinal research is needed to settle this matter. Third, the generalizability of the study is limited by the sampling frame used. While the organizations sampled do represent a wide range of organizational sizes and industries, it is limited to ﬁrms that have appointed environmental o(cid:129)cers and, therefore, to the industries that are environmentally sensitive. Future research should examine ﬁrms in similar industries that have not appointed environmental o(cid:129)cers to discern if this sampling criterion limits the generalizability of our results. Despite these limitations, our ﬁndings are quite robust and the results are very provocative. It appears that ﬁrms that better develop the capability to incorporate concerns for the environment into their strategic planning process possess competi- tive advantages in the marketplace and are better stewards of the environment. Therefore, a classic ‘win–win’ relationship appears to exist and the strategic planning process may be the vehicle for achieving this desirable goal (Elkington, 1994; Stead and Stead, 1995). In contrast, the persuasive ‘lose–win’ argument advanced by Wally and Whitehead (1994) may be premature. Clearly, additional research is needed to further explore these relationships. Although our data show that the beneﬁts of corporate environmental practices appear to outweigh the costs, the exact relationship is by no means clear. For example, some observers have argued that the beneﬁts of proactive corporate activism regarding the natural environment may simply be the result of non- recurring cost-reducing windfalls a orded to the corporation by addressing ‘low- hanging fruit’. This perspective is especially provocative to economists as it suggests that ﬁrms are not operating on their private e(cid:129)ciency frontiers.[1] Others, such as Hart (1995), argue that the beneﬁts are systemic and long term. Thus, it would be extremely helpful to know ‘where returns to environmental performance end’, as Russo and Fouts (1997, p. 552) recently concluded. Relatedly, it would also be helpful to know when those returns end. Clearly, these are important issues for not only private sector managers, but also public sector regulators seeking to # Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1998 INCORPORATING NATURAL ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 257 preserve market competition as well as a sustainable natural environment. Overall, these ﬁndings reﬁne and extend the natural resource-based perspective as well as o er useful insights into the strategic planning research. Hart (1995) advanced a conceptual argument for the resource-based perspective to include the natural environment. He argued that those ﬁrms which better incorporated the natural environment into the ﬁrm’s capabilities would experience superior performance. This argument challenges the conventional view that environmental concerns cost the ﬁrm more than it beneﬁts (Wally and Whitehead, 1994). Our study provides modest empirical support for the natural resource-based perspective advanced by Hart. While these results are intriguing, additional research is clearly needed. Also, this study provides evidence, as suggested by a number of researchers (e.g. Amit and Schoemaker, 1993; Conner, 1991; Peteraf, 1993; Wernerfelt, 1995), that the resource-based perspective is useful in further evaluating earlier strategic management research streams. In this case, we framed the planning literature within the natural resource-based perspective and new insights were generated. Furthermore, by identifying two antecedents of integration into the strategic planning process, we have provided opportunities for managers to implement and ﬁeld test our ﬁndings. We hope that future research in the form of longitudinal case studies and additional surveys will reﬁne and extend our understanding of the development of the organizational capability of integrating environmental issues into the strategic planning process.
