STRATEGIC HRM IN CHINA: CONFIGURATIONS AND COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE I R E N E   H .   C H O W,   J I A - C H I   H U A N G ,   A N D   S H A N S H I   L I U The strategic HR literature suggests that a firm will perform better through internal appropriate fit among HRM practices (the configuration fit) and through external appropriate fit between a firm’s HRM practices and busi- ness strategy. The present study adopts a configuration approach to iden- tify unique patterns of HR practices and business strategy that are posited to be maximally effective. The proposed relationships were empirically tested by surveying with a sample of 241 business firms in Guangzhou, South China, to find out the extent that four HR configurations could be successfully adopted in the Chinese context. The results revealed that HR configurations are significantly related to effect in predicting overall out- come performance and turnover, but not significantly related to effect on sales growth and profit growth rates. Research findings showed not only competitive strategies are significantly related to effect on HR configura- tions. The results also showed significant interaction effects between HR configurations and business strategy in their effect on profit and sales growth. These results further extended support for a contingency perspec- tive in strategic HRM to the Chinese context, with significant practical im- plications for managing HRM in China. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. IntroductionO ver  the  last  two  decades,  there  has been  considerable  interest  in  using the configuration approach to study the  role  human  resource  manage- ment practices play in contributing to  an  organization’s  sustained  competitive advantage.  Organizational  configuration refers  to  “any  multidimensional  constella- tion  of  conceptually  distinct  characteristics that  commonly  occur  together”  (Meyer, Tsui, & Hinings, 1993, p. 1175). Configura- tion  approaches  focus  on  the  realized  pat- tern  of  multiple  variables,  how  these  vari- ables  interact  over  time,  and  how  the  pat- tern  relates  to  various  organizational outcomes (Delery & Doty, 1996; Ketchen et al.,  1997).  The  configuration  literature  is grounded  in  structural  contingency  theory (Meyer et al., 1993). HRM strategies must be combined with specific business competitive strategies  if  they  are  to  enhance  organiza- tional performance.  Sustainable  HRM  systems  are  those  that are  internally  coherent  and  consistent  with Correspondence to: Irene Chow, Professor, Department of Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Room 316, K.K.

The  underlying  logic  is  the  assumption that congruence or fit would result in organi- zational effectiveness (Delery, 1998). The con- tingency  of  a  strategic  approach emphasizes that HR practices need to  be  contingent  upon  the  firm’s business strategy to be effective. To more  effectively  gain  competitive advantage, it is important to inte- grate  HRM  with  business  strategy (Gunnigle  &  Moore,  1994).  This can best be understood by identify- ing  distinct,  internally  consistent sets of HR practices and their rela- tionships  to  organization’s  busi- ness strategy and performance out- comes. The present study adopts a configuration approach to identify unique  patterns  of  HR  practices and  business  strategy  that  are posited to be maximally effective.  The majority of previous stud- ies on this topic were based in the Western  context.  Current  studies in China focus largely on foreign- invested enterprises (FIEs) or joint ventures (Bjorkman & Fan, 2002; Ding & Akhtar, 2001). To date in China,  very  little  systematic, large-scale  surveying  has  been done on managing the human re- source.  Yet  because  one-fifth  of the  world’s  population  lives  in China,  understanding  how  to manage its labor force not only is useful  to  researchers  and  practi- tioners,  but  also  could  have  an  important impact  on  China’s  reform  programs.  Given the  different  institutional  environment  of the socialist market and the rapid growth of China’s economy, it would be interesting to find  out  how  effective  HR  management might  affect  organizational  performance  in the world’s largest transitional economy. De- spite the abundant supply of labor in China, HR professionals found that fewer than 10% of Chinese job applicants have the skills re- quired for jobs in foreign companies (Farrell &  Grant,  2005).  Such  findings  are  particu- management might affect organizational performance in the world’s largest transitional economy.  larly alarming since HR practices have been identified as key drivers of employee engage- ment.  In  the  context  of  the  Chinese  econ- omy, what are the key elements of HR prac- tices  to  better performance?  that  may  contribute  The present study fills the gap by exam- ining the extent of adoption of HRM config- urations in South China, particularly while it transitions  from  a  centrally  planned  econ- omy  to  a  market  economy.  If  organizations want  to  gain  a  competitive  advantage  by continually  developing  personnel  expertise, the  adoption  of  HR  systems  will  become more prevalent in China. China’s emergence in the global economy provides a rich con- text  for  this  study.  As  more  multinational firms  enter  the  China  market,  results  from the present study can offer some insights for researchers and practitioners alike. China introduced market reforms in the early 1980s. Admission into the World Trade Organization, together with the presence of FIEs, has changed the competitive landscape. Under  pressure  to  compete  globally,  China accelerated  its  transition  to  a  more  market- oriented  economy.  HR  practices  have  been moving away from a highly centralized allo- cation process to a more market-driven and performance-based  system.  The  HRM  prac- tices are influenced by environmental, insti- tutional, and organizational conditions. The transitional  Chinese  economy  is  not  a  free market. Most enterprises are still constrained by  government  regulations  and  interven- tion. The conventional “Western model” of HRM  may  not  fully  capture  the  HR  chal- lenges facing firms in China. Therefore, HR practices  must  be  modified  to  fit  China’s unique cultural and institutional context.  Building on the current research, this ar- ticle attempts to explore more systematically the relationships between HR practices, busi- ness strategies, and firm performance using a configuration approach in the Chinese con- text. In addition, we examine the interaction effects of HRM and business strategy on both financial and behavioral aspects of firm per- formance. The findings complement existing literature on the configuration perspective in HRM  research.  Empirical  results  offer  some Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm Strategic HRM in China: Configurations and Competitive Advantage 689 evidence  of  the  magnitude  of  the  relation- ship  among  HR  practices  and  the  effects  of the  interaction  between  business  strategy and firm performance. The findings offer im- portant  insights  for  multinational  business executives who are looking to formulate ef- fective HRM strategies and align their firm’s business strategy to attain high-performance results in China. The following section begins with a brief review of existing research on HR configura- tion and business strategy. Based on a review of  the  literature,  hypotheses  are  developed and tested with empirical data collected for this study. The article concludes with a dis- cussion  of  managerial  implications  and  fu- ture research direction. Theory and Hypotheses The  contingency  theory  posits  that  HRM should  match  the  demand  of  the  internal and  external  conditions  (Delery  &  Doty, 1996; Schuler & Jackson, 1987). External fit links  HR  systems  to  business  strategy, whereas internal fit focuses on HRM practice configurations  complementarities across  HRM  activities  positively  impact  or- ganization  [Wright  &  Snell,  1991]).  There- fore, integrating HR configuration with busi- ness  strategy  is  conducive  to  enhancing organizational effectiveness.  (i.e.,  HR Configurations and Performance Current literature on HR practices is config- ured  on  the  basis  of  two  main  approaches: resource-based  and  control-based  (Bam- berger  &  Mesoulan,  2000).  In  the  resource- based  view,  the  value  and  uniqueness  of human capital is geared toward the internal development  of  employee  competencies,  as opposed  to  the  market-based  acquisition  of such  competencies  (Wernerfelt,  1984).  The internal  development  HR  system  is  charac- terized  by  extensive  training,  promotion from  within,  developmental  performance appraisal,  skill-based  pay,  and  job  security, whereas the market-based HR system is char- acterized by little formal training, little secu- rity,  and  market-based  compensation.  The Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm control-based approach focuses on monitor- ing employee behaviors and employee com- pliance  with  process-based  standards  (Snell, 1992). It is further divided into two alterna- tives:  process-oriented  control  or  outcome- oriented control. Process-oriented control is characterized as having fixed and explicit  job  design,  formalized evaluation through carefully pre- scribed job requirements, and an efficiency-based  reward.  In  con- trast, outcome-oriented control is characterized by having extensive long-term  rewards  and  employee participation  and  involvement (Dyer & Reeves, 1995).  Integrating  these  two  ap- proaches, Lepak and Snell (2002) proposed  four  configurations (i.e., commitment-based, produc- tivity-based,  compliance-based, and  collaborative-based).  Draw- ing  on  Lepak  and  Snell  (1999), the  distinguishing  characteristics of each type of configuration are briefly described as follows. Commitment-based  HR  sys- tems  nurture  employee  involve- ment  and  maximize  the  firm’s return  on  human  capital  invest- ments.  Firms  invest  substantially to  develop  unique  skills  through extensive training initiatives. Jobs are  loosely  defined  to  capitalize on  employee  potential.  Employ- ees  are  encouraged  to  learn  and master  firm-specific  competen- cies. Pay is linked to performance. These  practices  are  designed  to elicit commitment from employ- ees.  The  collective  culture  main- tains  close  connections  to  each other  and  encourages  mutual commitment  toward  each  other. Empirical  results  from  collective societies  such  as  Singapore  and  Taiwan,  as well  as  from  other  Asian  countries  such  as Korea,  support  high-commitment/-involve- ment work systems or practices, with a posi- tive  effect  on  organizational  performance (Bae  &  Lawler,  2000;  Huang,  2000;  Khatri, The collective culture maintains close connections to each other and encourages mutual commitment toward each other. Empirical results from collective societies such as Singapore and Taiwan, as well as from other Asian countries such as Korea, support high- commitment/ involvement work systems or practices, with a positive effect on organizational performance. 690 HUMANRESOURCEMANAGEMENT, Winter 2008 2000). Takeuchi et al. (2003) found support for  configuring  HRM  strategically  in  China. Hence, we expect a commitment configura- tion of HR practice will outperform other HR configurations in China. Collaboration-based consistent with the collective Chinese cultural value.  HR focuses on group-based and egalitarian practices and is Market-based  HR  systems  emphasize staffing and deployment of skills for imme- diate contribution. They rely heavily on the external labor market for securing the right people for jobs (Koch & McGrath, 1996). Or- ganizations are willing to pay market wages to attract human capital with the necessary skills and are less likely to invest heavily in training and development. These skills  are  easily  acquired  in  the market.  The  transitional  econ- omy  is  full  of  rapid  changes,  as well as uncertainty and volatility. China is far from being a typical free-market  economy.  Its  transi- tion  continues  to  be  planned  by the state, which has been actively involved  in  shaping  economic and business affairs. Market-based HR  configuration  is  not  effective because the labor mechanism has not  been  efficiently  developed and qualified talent is not readily available.  Chinese  workers  get used  to  long-term,  secured  em- ployment,  rather  than  a  market- type, contractual relationship. Ge and Ding (2005) found that market orientation has an insignificant effect on firm performance. Compliance-based  HR  activities  focus  on securing  compliance  with  terms  and  condi- tions.  Firms  are  more  likely  to  concentrate on  enforcing  rules  and  regulations,  along with  attaining  preestablished  standards. Training,  performance,  and  compensation are likely to be job-based (Milkovich & New- man,  2005).  Formalized  rules  and  proce- dures,  along  with  centralized  power,  seem the  norm  in  Chinese  firms.  In  the  Chinese context  of  high  power  distance  and  an  au- thoritative corporate culture, supervisors are reluctant  to  share  power  with  subordinates and unwilling to delegate power during deci- sion-making processes. They tend to restrict and  control  subordinates’  behavior  and  use harsh  rules  and  regulations  to  ensure  com- pliance.  As  a  result,  Chinese  employees  are reluctant  to  accept  responsibility  and  un- likely  to  take  the  initiative  to  get  things done.  Thus,  compliance-based  HR  is  nega- tively related to firm performance. However, under the high-power-distance cultural envi- ronment, employees tend to accept the con- centration of power in their supervisors and get used to being controlled and monitored. For these reasons, compliance-based HR has no negative effect on turnover. Collaborative-based HR systems encourage and  reward  cooperation,  collaboration,  and information sharing. Organizations are more likely  to  focus  on  process  facilitation  and team  building.  Communication,  team  proj- ects,  and  job  rotations  are  established  to  fa- cilitate information sharing and the transfer of  knowledge.  Group-based  rewards  and  ap- praisal are used to develop and integrate in- terdependence  trust  and  collaboration (Quinn, Anderson, & Finkelstein, 1996). Col- laboration-based  HR  focuses  on  group-based and  egalitarian  practices  and  is  consistent with  the  collective  Chinese  cultural  value. The  need  to  develop  cooperation,  informa- tion  sharing,  and  trust  only  pays  off  in  the long run. The collective culture emphasizing harmony, along with less aggressive attitudes toward  others,  tends  to  favor  less  competi- tion. Thus, we expect collaborative-based HR to be moderately related to firm performance.  The  current  literature  shows  that  HRM practices,  in  the  form  of  high-involvement work  practices,  are  associated  with  positive performance  (Levering  & Moskowitz,  1993)  and  higher  financial  suc- cess  (Lawler,  Mohrman,  &  Ledford,  1995). Accumulated  research  shows  that  specific configuration  or  architecture  of  HRM  prac- tices  allows  a  firm  to  yield  better  perform- ance (Sheppeck & Militello, 2000). Based on the  above  discussion,  we  set  up  hypotheses for  different  HR  configurations  that  lead  to significant differences in firm performance.  outcomes  H1a:  Commitment  configuration  is  positively associated with firm performance. H1b:  Market-based  and  collaborative-based HR  show  no  significant  relation  to  firm performance.

Integrating HR Configuration and Business Strategy Competitive strategies have been tested in China’s business firms, including joint ven- tures  and  private  enterprises  (Brouthers  & Xu,  2002;  Ding  &  Akhtar,  2001).  Ge  and Ding’s  (2005)  study  indicates  that  quality enhancement  strategy  is  dominant  among Chinese firms, followed by cost leadership and innovation strategies. Business strategy has been used as a contingent factor on HR configurations and firm performance (Bird &  Beechler,  1995;  Martell,  Gupta,  &  Car- roll, 1996). In their empirical study, Schuler and Jackson (1987) and Sanz-Valle, Sabater- Sanchez,  and  Aragon-Sanchez  (1999) adopted various types of strategies and des- ignated  different  types  of  HR  activities  in organizations.  innovation  Innovative  strategies  focus  on  offering something new and different. HR practices include  selecting  highly  skilled  and  cre- ative individuals, granting more discretion to  employees  while  exercising  minimal control,  and  a  long-term  focus  on  and greater  commitment  to  development  of human capital. Organizations adopting an innovative strategy need to acquire enough highly skilled new employees from external sources  to  create  new  knowledge  for  tech- nological  (Schuler,  1989). Therefore, organizations focusing on inno- vation are most likely to adopt a market HR system.  Sanz-Valle  et  al.  (1999)  discovered that  organizations  using  innovative  strat- egy most frequently utilize temporary con- tracting.  Furthermore,  Delery  and  Doty (1996) found partial support that matching innovative strategy with the market system resulted in positive organizational perform- ance.  In  addition,  when  innovation  strat- egy  is  used,  it  also  needs  to  be  supple- mented  with  long-term  orientation  and frequent  and  intense  interaction  among employees  (Schuler,  1989).  Innovation strategy is consistent with HR practices that focus  on  human  capital  development. Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm Companies with an innovative strategy in- vest more money on training for many rea- sons. They recognize that they need to de- velop not only the knowledge and skills of their  personnel,  but  also  their  employees’ attitudes if they want to encourage creativ- ity,  flexibility,  and  the  propensity  to  take risk  and  cooperation  that  this  strategy  re- quires  if  it  is  to  be  implemented  success- fully.  High  uncertainty  avoidance  and  less tolerance for risk taking slow down innova- tion.  Further,  rules  and  regulations  reduce individual  initiative.  Thus,  innovation strategy  is  positively  associated  with  mar- ket,  commitment,  and  collaboration  sys- tems  and  negatively  associated  with  com- pliance systems. The impact of innovation strategy  will  be  stronger  for  commitment and collaboration-HR configurations in the Chinese context.  Quality-enhancing  strategy  attempts  to procure  and  deliver  the  highest quality  of  goods  and  services possible.  This  strategy  is  domi- nant  in  Chinese  firms  (Ding  & Akhtar,  2001).  The  concern  for quality  is  expected  to  be  re- flected  in  an  organization’s  ap- proach  to  HR—for  example,  by having  active  employee  partici- pation  in  continuous  improve- ment  processes  (i.e.,  voluntary quality  circle;  Barad,  1995).  A major driving force for this may be  solely  product  quality  certifi- cation.  The  appropriate  HRM philosophy  for  quality-enhanc- ing strategy is accumulation, which empha- sizes high levels of involvement and skilled execution.

After  all,  the  technical  skills that  are  lacking  can  be  gained  through  in- house  training  programs.  The  organiza- tion’s commitment to continuous improve- ment  and  human  capital  development,  in turn, facilitates the practice of lifetime em- ployment  systems.  Sanz-Valle  et  al.

Therefore,  we  ex- pected  quality-enhancing  strategy  to  be positively  associated  with  a  commitment system, and negatively associated with mar- ket systems. jobs, close monitoring, and minimal levels of training and development. The HR practices for cost-reduction strategy maximize efficiency by using narrowly designed The  cost-reduction  strategy  strives  to produce goods and services less expensively than  do  a  firm’s  competitors.  Cost-reduc- tion  strategy  was  found  to  be  unrelated  to the  strategic  role  of  HR  functions  (Ding  & Akhtar,  2001).  The  HR  practices for cost-reduction strategy maxi- mize  efficiency  by  using  nar- rowly designed jobs, close moni- toring,  and  minimal  levels  of training and development (Sanz- Valle et al., 1999; Schuler, 1989). Cost-minimization firms are less eager  to  invest  in  their  human capital. Emphasis is placed on ef- ficiently  managing  their  work- force  using  practices  such  as  lit- tle  employee  involvement  and reducing their discretionary deci- sion  making.  Communication  is mostly  top-down.  Performance appraisals  focus  on  error  reduc- tion,  and  training  tends  to  be used as a remedial activity aimed at  correcting  skill  deficiencies. Rewards  are  based  on  fixed guidelines,  with  little  flexibility.  HR  prac- tices are simply administrative and reactive. Preference for centralized, hierarchical, and formalized  structure  appears  to  favor  cost- reduction  strategy  in  Chinese  organiza- tions. Thus, we predict cost-reduction strat- egy  will  be  positively  associated  with compliance-based HR.  The  hypotheses  set  up  to  examine  the impact the three competitive strategies have on HR configurations are: H2a: Cost-reduction strategy is positively associ- ated with compliance. H2b:  Quality-enhancing  strategy  is  positively associated with commitment and negatively associated with market. H2c: Innovation strategy is positively associated with  commitment,  market,  and  collabora- tion, with a lower magnitude in market.  Interaction Effects of HR Configuration and Business Strategy on Performance Based  on  the  literature,  an  organization’s strategy  moderates  the  effect  of  HR  prac- tices  on  firm  performance  (Hitt,  Bierman, Shimizu, & Kochhar, 2001). Previous stud- ies  suggested  that  a  bundle  or  set  of  HRM practices  with  appropriate  business  strate- gies  were  related  to  reduced  employee turnover (Arthur, 1994) and higher produc- tivity (MacDuffie, 1995) and greater finan- cial  performance  (Huselid,  1995).  Delery and  Doty  (1996),  as  well  as  Youndt,  Snell, Dean, and Lepak (1996) found that the in- teraction  of  business  strategy  and  HRM practices was an important factor in organ- ization  effectiveness.  Bjorkman  and  Fan’s (2002)  study  revealed  that  HR  system  and strategy  integration  had  a  positive  impact on  the  performance  of  Chinese  firms. Based  on  the  view  of  external  fit  of  HRM systems,  aligning  HR  configuration  with business  strategy  will  enhance  firm  per- formance. Therefore, we assert, as discussed in the previous section, that HR configura- tions  paired  with  appropriate  business strategies will have a positive effect on or- ganization  performance.  To  the  contrary, the  interaction  of  HR  configurations  with inappropriate  strategies  will  have  a  nega- tive impact. There is a total of 12 possible interactions  altogether.  Due  to  space  limi- tations, three of the most critical hypothe- ses are set as follows: H3a:  The  interaction  of  cost-reduction  strategy with  compliance  configuration  will  further enhance organizational performance. H3b: The interaction of quality-enhancing strat- egy and commitment configuration will fur- ther  enhance  organizational  performance, and  the  interaction  with  market  configura- tion will reduce organizational performance.

Methods Sample and Procedures In this study, the triangulation method (in- terviews,  survey,  and  documentation)  was used  to  ensure  accuracy  of  the  data.  Inter- views  were  conducted  with  HR  experts  and managers  from  48  firms  in  the  Pearl  River Delta area of China to identify a broad range of HR practices in the Chinese context. Based on the opinion of HR professionals and ex- perts  from  the  interviews,  together  with  an extensive review from the current literature, a list of HR practices was generated and thor- oughly  discussed  by  a  team  of  HR  re- searchers. For the present study, a total of 54 HR practices were included, covering the do- mains of staffing, training and development, performance appraisal, reward and compen- sation,  information  sharing  and  participa- tion in decision making, and job security. Re- spondents  were  asked  to  mark  the  number that best indicated the degree to which each statement  described  HRM  practices  em- ployed by their organization on a five-point scale (1 = not at all to 5 = very great extent). The  questionnaire  was  written  in  Chinese. These  items  were  pretested  with  practicing managers to verify the usefulness.  Questionnaires were e-mailed to the com- pany’s  HR  department,  and  follow-up  tele- phone calls were made. A total of 300 ques- tionnaires  were  distributed,  and  241 responses  were  received.  The  response  rate was  about  80%.  Respondents  included  mid- dle  managers  (65.4%),  top  management (13.5%), and frontline managers (21.1%). Re- sults  from  one-way  analysis  of  variance (ANOVA)  revealed  no  significant  differences in most of the HR, strategy, and performance measures  except  for  compliance  configura- tion  and  innovation  strategy.  The  results demonstrated that responses from the diverse groups  were  relatively  homogeneous.  The sample  consisted  of  241  firms  from  Guang- dong,  China.  The  average  length  that  re- sponding  firms  have  been  in  operation  was Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm 12.3 years, although the length of operation ranged from 1 to 145 years. In terms of own- ership, 32.9% were Chinese firms (including state-owned  and  collectively  owned),  49.6% were  Hong  Kong  and  Taiwan  firms  doing business  in  China,  and  the  remainder  were foreign-invested  and  joint  ventures.  Indus- tries  represented  included  manufacturing (43.3%),  technology  and  electronic  (38.2%), and a variety of other service industries, like financial/insurance  and  wholesaling/retail- ing.  The  average  number  of  employees  per firm  was  2,395  but  ranged  from 13 to 91,200. Using a t-test, there were no significant differences in HR  configurations  and  business strategies  between  firms  with fewer  than  100  employees  and larger  firms  with  more  than  100 employees.  The  ratio  of  manage- rial  to  operating  staff  was  9.5%. On  average,  the  HR  department had  9.2  persons  and  an  average annual turnover rate of 11.86%.  The survey included a broad range of HR practices, such as staffing, training and development, performance Measures HR Configurations appraisal, compensation, job design, international promotion, security, information sharing, and participation.  The  survey  included  a  broad range  of  HR  practices,  such  as staffing,  training  and  develop- ment,  performance  appraisal, compensation,  job  design,  inter- national  promotion,  security,  in- formation sharing, and participa- tion.  Items  were  identified  to  form  four configurations.  The  results  of  the  factor structure  based  on  a  theory-driven  configu- ration of HR practices can be found in Table I. The resulting HR configuration is very sim- ilar to Lepak and Snell’s commitment, mar- ket, collaboration, and compliance. In 2002, Lepak  and  Snell  proposed  a  productivity configuration  instead  of  market  configura- tion. Given that China is the world’s factory, productivity  configuration  seems  to  be  cru- cial.  However,  because  the  overall  guiding principle for economic reform is market ori- entation,  it  will  be  appropriate  to  use  mar- ket-based  configuration.

But  if  em- ployees are required to follow strict rules and procedures,  in  some  sense  it  will  likely  re- strict  employee  development,  participation, and  communication.  Thus,  the  reverse- coded  items  can  be  interpreted  as  compli- ance.  Following  the  recommendation  by MacDuffie  (1995)  and  others  (Koch  &  Mc- Grath, 1996; Youndt et al, 1996), each con- figuration was operationalized as an additive index of HR practices (Lepak & Snell, 2002). Four  HR  indices  were  calculated  by  taking the mean value of the items in each configu- ration. The alpha reliability of the measure- ment scales ranged from 0.76 to 0.86. Business Strategies The  types  of  strategies  included  cost  reduc- tion, innovation, and quality enhancement. Following  Schuler  and  Jackson  (1987)  and Huang  (2001),  we  adopted  ten  items  in  the present  study.  Previous  studies  have  vali- dated the use of business strategies in a tran- sitional economy (Brouthers & Xu, 2002; Ge &  Ding,  2005).  Respondents  were  asked  to rate each item as it relates to their company’s strategies on a five-point scale ranging from 1  (strongly  disagree)  to  5  (strongly  agree). These  items  were  factor  analyzed  using  a principal  factor  with  varimax  rotation method.  The  factor  structure  of  business strategy is given in Table II. All three factors accounted  for  59.35%  of  the  total  variance explained.  The  alpha  coefficients  for  cost, quality,  and  innovation  were  .68,  .78,  and .71, respectively. Performance Measures The  present  study  uses  multiple  firm  per- formance measures (i.e., employee turnover, financial  profit,  and  sales  growth).

Managers are likely to pro- vide  the  best  estimate  of  firm  performance. The dependent variables in the present study include four performance indicators: overall performance,  turnover  rate,  sales  growth rate, and profit growth rate. Sales growth and profit growth reflect the conventional meas- ure  of  profitability  and  market  share.  Sales growth  rate  and  profit  growth  rate  were measured by the percentage change in sales and  profit  over  the  prior  two years.  Overall  performance  is  a composite  measure  of  productiv- ity,  the  quality  of  products  and services,  research  and  develop- ment  capability,  and  market shares.  These  items  were  meas- ured  on  a  five-point  Likert  scale ranging  from  1  (very  low)  to  5 (very  high).  Factor  analysis  re- sulted  in  one  single  factor  ac- counted  for  54.68%  of  the  vari- ance explained.  State-owned firms tend to be more embedded in institutional constraints and therefore tend to be less flexible in adopting innovative Control Variables HR practices.  Because  firms  with  superior  re- sources  would  be  more  likely  to be  able  to  formulate  and  imple- ment unique and innovative strategies, firm size  and  ownership  types  are  controlled  for when  predicting  organizational  perform- ance. Firm size was measured by the number of full-time employees. We used natural log- arithmic  transformation  to  normalize  the distributions  and  made  the  measure  more consistent  with  existing  literature.  A  firm’s ownership structure also can influence HRM and performance. State-owned firms tend to be  more  embedded  in  institutional  con- straints and therefore tend to be less flexible in  adopting  innovative  HR  practices.  In terms of ownership structure, we used firms in Hong Kong and Taiwan firms as a base for comparison.  Three  dummy  variables  were created  to  represent  state-owned,  collective, and  foreign-invested/joint  ventures.  Results from χ2 =36.57, df = 3, p < .01, indicate a sig- nificant difference in ownership distribution in  comparison  with  Guangdong  province. Hong  Kong  and  Taiwan  firms  are  slightly overrepresented  in  the  sample.  Hong  Kong and Taiwan firms play a leading role in trans- forming  enterprise  management  in  South China. The industry is another variable to be controlled. The service industry was used as a  basis  for  comparison.  Two  dummy  vari- ables were created to represent the manufac- turing  and  technology  industry  (microcom- puters,  telecommunication  and  other electronic facilities). Since ownership and in- dustry are control variables, statistical proce- dure rules out serious bias of the results. Regression analysis was used to assess the relative impact of all the variables and the ex- tent  to  which  the  four  HR  configurations  af- fect  performance  through  the  interaction  of three business strategies. A potential problem of common method variance can result from collecting all variables from the same respon- dent, in the same survey. Following Podsakoff, MacKenzie,  and  Lee  (2003),  we  checked  for presence of common method bias by conduct- ing  Harman’s  one-factor  test  in  our  data.  A principal components factor analysis with an unrotated  solution  yielded  ten  factors  with eigenvalues  greater  than  1,  accounting  for 63.87% of the total variance. The largest vari- ance  explained  by  factor  1  is  34.60%,  which suggests that no single factor accounted for a majority  of  the  covariance  in  the  variables. The result shows that common method vari- ance is unlikely to be a serious problem.  Results The  descriptive  statistics  and  correlations among variables are given in Table III. It is ob- served that significant positive correlation ex- ists among the three business strategies. The four  HR  configurations  are  also  significantly correlated  with  each  other.  The  overall  out- come is positively correlated with innovation, commitment, market, and collaboration, but negatively correlated with compliance. These correlation results confirmed the findings re- ported in previous research (Bird & Beechler, 1995;  Huang,  2001;  Takeuchi,  Wakebayashi, & Chen, 2003).

Profit growth rate shows no signifi- cant  correlation  with  any  of  the  variables. State-owned  firms  show  lower  performance and staff turnover rate as reflected by signifi- cant  negative  correlation  with  overall  out- come and turnover. As predicted, both overall outcome and turnover had a significant effect on  all  four  HR  configurations.  In  contrast, sales  and  profit  showed  no  significant  effect on all four HR configurations. For  business  strategy,  cost  reduction  has no significant effect on all four performance measures.  Quality  enhancement  strategy shows  a  significant  negative  effect  on  sales, profit, and turnover rate. Innovation strategy is positively correlated with overall outcome but negatively correlated with sales growth. Table IV displaces the results of regression analysis testing the effects of HR configuration on performance. Firm size, ownership, and in- dustry  were  entered  as  control.  State-owned firms  have  a  significant  negative  impact  on overall  performance  and  the  rate  of  staff turnover.  Obviously,  state-owned  enterprises (SOEs) are less efficient. Workers in SOEs enjoy high  job  security  and  tend  to  have  lower turnover. Technology firms are more efficient. The  check  for  Variance  Inflation  Factor  (VIF) shows  no  problem  of  multicollinearity.  HR configurations have a significant effect in pre- dicting  overall  outcome  and  turnover,  as shown in the significant ∆R2 and F values, but no significant effect on sales and profit growth rates.  Perhaps  financial  measures  may  be  af- fected by many other factors in a transitional economy.  In  predicting  the  overall  outcome, compliance has a marginally significant nega- tive  effect  (β  =  –.18,  p <  .10),  while  commit- ment has a significant positive effect (β = .21, T A B L E   I V Results of Hierarchical Regression Analyses Testing Effects of HR Configurations  on Performance Overall Outcome Sales Growth Proﬁt Growth Turnover Rate (cid:36)R2   .11** Variables (cid:66) Control Firm size (log) State-owned   Collective   Foreign and JV    Manufacturing Technology .00  –.27**  –.04    .03   .12   .19* (cid:66)  –.03  –.09   .11  –.03  –.08  –.15 (cid:36)R2   .04 (cid:66)  –.01  –.08   .05  –.08   .03   .00 (cid:36)R2   .02 (cid:36)R2   .06+ (cid:66)   .13+  –.13+   .04   .05   .10  –.06 HRM conﬁguration   .24**   .01   .06  .06*   Commitment   Market   Compliance   Collaboration   .21*   .09  –.18+   .13 R2 F + p < .10, * p < .05, ** p < .01.  –.09   .01  –.06   .09  –.19   .17  –.26+  –.18  –.11  –.02   .19+   .03   .35**  10.70**   .05   .66   .08   .93   .12  2.52** Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm Strategic HRM in China: Configurations and Competitive Advantage 699 p < .05). Such results are consistent with cur- rent literature stating that a commitment HR system  invests  in  human  capital  in  a  move that, in turn, improves firm performance. A compliance HR system has a significant negative effect on profit growth and a signifi- cant positive effect on the turnover rate. The compliance-based HR system does not lead to better performance even in a traditional high- power-distance and hierarchical Chinese soci- ety. A market-based HR system shows no sig- nificant  effect  on  all  performance  measures. The results are consistent with our predictions in Hypotheses 1a–c. Market-oriented and col- laboration-based HR produced no significant effect,  particularly  for  SOEs.  Inherited  from the historical burden of the planned socialist economy, SOEs are less market-oriented.  The  impact  of  the  three  business  strate- gies  on  HR  configurations  can  be  found  in Table V. When the control variables were first entered  into  the  regression,  collectively owned firms showed a significant negative ef- fect  on  commitment  but  a  significant  posi- tive  impact  on  compliance.  Collectively owned firms with fewer resources tend to rely on  control  rather  than  investing  in  high- commitment  HR  practices.  In  testing  the main effect, the three business strategies have a significant effect on the four HR configura- tions, as indicated by the significant ∆R2 and F values. Again, a VIF test for multicollinear- ity shows no problem. As for different busi- ness strategies, we observed a highly signifi- cant  effect  on  four  HR  configurations.  Cost reduction had a significant negative effect on compliance (β = –.24, p < .05) but a significant positive effect on collaboration (β = .30, p < .01). Contrary to our expectation, Hypothesis 2a is not supported. Quality-enhancing strat- egy  significantly  affected  commitment  only (β = .23, p < .05). Though quality-enhancing strategy is negatively associated with market configuration  but  not  significant  (β  =  –.09). Hypothesis 2b is partially supported.

Hypothesis 2c is confirmed. Compliance HR practice is not conducive to innovation strategy.  Results of regression analyses testing the interaction effect are depicted in Table VI. As recommended by Aiken and West (1996), the mean-centered  variables  were  used  for  the main and interaction terms in the regression analysis.  We  conducted  separate  regression analyses on all four dependent variables and tested  all  the  possible  interaction  terms  in our analysis. We observed significant interac- tion  effects  on  overall  outcome,  and  sales and  profit  growth  rates,  but  no  significant interaction  effect  on  turnover  rate.  There- fore, the results of the turnover rate are not included in Table VI.  For  the  main  effect,  HR  configurations show  no  significant  impact  on  the  three performance measures, except the marginal significant  effect  collaborative  HR  systems have on overall outcome. Both quality-en- hancing and innovation strategy are nega- tively  related  to  sales  growth  and  profit growth.  Cost-reduction  strategy  does  not have  any  significance  on  three  perform- ance measures.

Hypothesis  3a, therefore, is not supported. Even though not hypothesizing  in  our  interaction  terms,  the interaction  of  cost  X  commitment  showed significant  negative  effect  on  both  overall outcome (β = –.52, p < .10) and profit growth (β = –1.97, p < .01). There was no significant effect  for  the  interaction  of  cost  and  other HR configurations. The interaction effects of quality X commitment had a marginally sig- nificant positive effect on overall outcome (β =  .35,  p <  .10),  sales  (β  =  .70,  p <  .05),  and profit  growth  (β  =  .88,  p <  .05).  Quality  X market were negatively associated with over- all  outcome  (β  =  –.53,  p <  .05)  and  profit growth (β = –1.09, p < .05). These results sup- port  Hypothesis  3b.  Innovation  X  commit- ment has a significant positive effect on both sales (β = 1.12, p < .05) and profit growth (β = 1.47, p < .05). Contrary to our prediction, innovation has no significant interaction ef- fect with other HR configurations. These re- sults only provide partial support to Hypoth- esis  3c.  It  should  be  noted  that  HR configurations have no significant effect on sales  growth  and  profit  growth,  but  the  in- teraction of HR configurations and business strategy  shows  a  significant  effect  on  profit and sales growth, as indicated by highly sig- nificant F values.  Figures 1 to 4 display the pattern of sig- nificant interaction terms (due to space lim- itation, not all significant interaction charts are  shown  here).  When  a  commitment  HR configuration  was  matched  with  low-cost strategy, it had a positive impact on overall outcome,  as  shown  in  Figure  1.  High-cost strategy  is  not  likely  to  benefit  with  overall outcome  as  indicated  by  the  steep  negative slope  with  overall  outcome.  In  contrast,  a commitment  HR  configuration  matching with  a  high-quality  strategy  will  lead  to  a slight increase in profit growth, while using a  low-quality  strategy  leads  to  substantial negative profit growth for high-commitment HR, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 indicates that  high-quality  strategy  is  detrimental  to profit  growth  for  organizations  pursuing high market-based HR. Graphically, Figure 4 shows  that  for  organizations  with  the  com- mitment HR configuration, pursuing a high- innovation strategy does not make much dif- ference,  while  adopting  low-innovation strategy  will  result  in  dramatically  lower sales growth.  Discussion and Conclusions The present study seeks to identify the pat- tern  of  HRM  configurations  that  would  im- prove  the  performance  of  China’s  business firms.  Results  from  the  present  study  par- tially  support  the  configuration  hypothesis as a way to predict firm performance. Based on a theoretically driven measure, we assess the relative efficiency of various HR practice configurations.  Commitment  HR  showed  a positive  significant  effect  on  overall  out- come. Compliance showed a negative signif- icant  effect  on  overall  outcome,  a  marginal FIGURE 1. The Interaction Between Cost Strategy and Commitment HR Configuration on Overall Outcome FIGURE 2.

The Interaction Between Quality Strategy and Market HR Configuration on Profit Growth FIGURE 4. The Interaction Between Innovation Strategy and Commitment HR Configuration on Sales Growth positive  effect  on  turnover,  and  a  marginal negative  effect  on  profit  growth.  For  these reasons,  it  appears  obvious  that  organiza- tions  should  move  away  from  controlling employees and seek instead to gain commit- ment from their workers. Compliance in the high-power-distance  culture  is  not  well  re- ceived, at least not at the current stage of the diffusion process. Economic reforms have ac- tually  undermined  participative  manage- ment. For this reason, we believe further re- search in this area is needed.  The  findings  in  this  study  of  Chinese business firms indicate that a commitment HR configuration, compared with other HR configurations,  has  a  significantly  positive effect.  Results  from  the  present  study  are consistent  with  those  from  the  Western countries  (Arthur,  1994;  Delaney  & Huselid,  1996),  Asian  countries  (Bae  & Lawler, 2000; Guthrie, 2001), and even the Chinese  culture  societies  (Huang,  2000; Khatri, 2000). The results also confirm that a  commitment  HR  system  is  an  effective way to create a competitive advantage and enhance  organizational  performance  in emerging economies such as China (Bjork- man  &  Fan,  2002).  This  finding  offers  re- search-guided  practical  implications  for Chinese  firms  as  it  relates  to  upgrading their  HRM  system.  In  terms  of  business strategy, low cost is the dominant strategy used  in  Chinese  firms.  Results  from  the present study confirm findings from previ- ous studies, which showed that low cost is not a very good strategy for Chinese firms (Brouthers & Xu, 2002). A narrow emphasis on  cost  control  may  prevent  firms  from spending  on  new  product  development, technological  improvement,  and  quality control, which in turn may affect firm per- formance.  While  organizations  often  seek cost  advantages,  they  should  also  empha- size  quality.  Innovation  is  a  risky  strategy for organizations that are not emphasizing commitment HR practices. While  there  is  little  support  showing that HR configurations are significantly as- sociated with the growth of sales and prof- its, HR configurations combined with busi- ness  strategy  create  significant  interaction effects  on  sales  and  profit  growth.  The  in- teraction  of  particular  HR  configurations with  business  strategy  has  synergistic  ef- fects on performance. Results show signifi- cant  gains  if  HR  configuration  is  aligned with business strategy. Thus, if you want to yield  maximum  results,  it  is  important  to align HR configuration to a firm’s business strategy. In  the  present  study,  the  performance measures  include  overall  outcome  (a  com- posite measure), turnover (behavioral conse- quence),  financial  outcome  (profit  growth rate),  and  market  outcome  (sales  growth rate).  HR  configurations  are  most  likely  to have  a  significant  impact  on  HR  outcomes, followed  by  organizational,  financial,  and market  outcomes  (Dyer  &  Reeves,  1995). This is because HR strategies are primarily de- signed  to  impact  HR  outcomes.  Turnover  is affected in part by labor market conditions. Financial  and  market  outcomes  are  influ- enced  by  other  factors,  such  as  economic condition (Rogers & Wright, 1998). The im- pact on financial performance is minimal in Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm Strategic HRM in China: Configurations and Competitive Advantage 703 the  present  study.  Apparently,  the  current HR  practices  seem  to  have  less  effect  on  a firm’s  financial  performance,  at  least  in  the present  study  in  Guangdong,  China.  One reason  may  be  because  financial  perform- ance  is  influenced  by  other  economic  fac- tors, such as macroeconomic conditions and the  government’s  intervening  policy.  An- other  possible  explanation  is  that  because HR is regarded as an asset and source of sus- tainable  competitive  advantage,  the  out- comes generated by HRM may not necessar- ily be assessed using short-term performance measures (Pfeffer, 1994). Limitations and Future Research Directions Caution is needed when interpreting results in the configuration of HR practices. Organi- zations  use  a  wide  range  of  HRM  practices, and the lack of consensus in the configura- tion  of  HR  practices  has  led  to  inconsisten- cies in research linking HR practices to firm performance.  Attention  should  be  paid  to the adequacy of variables selected to identify configurations.  Another  possible  explana- tion  for  the  inconsistencies  lies  in  the  way these  HR  configurations  were  implemented in  the  chosen  sample.  It  is  very  likely  that senior  management  recognizes  the  impor- tance of human resource policies and ignores the  implementation  of  these  HR  practices. Future research is needed to fill this gap by assessing  the  level  of  implementation  of HRM in organizations. There  is  a  lack  of  statistical  evidence  of HR  configuration  in  relation  to  financial performance.  One  possible  explanation  for this  may  be  related  to  the  use  of  self-re- ported, subjective measurements. Profit rate is commonly accepted as a reliable proxy for assessing  financial  performance  (Kimbara, 1991).  Chinese  respondents  are  often  very sensitive  about  publicizing  financial  per- formance  figures.  Therefore,  rating  of  the profit  rate  and  a  subjective  evaluation  of corporate performance were employed as in- dicators of corporate financial performance. Subjective  measures  of  firm  performance were  widely  used  in  the  literature  (Bae  & Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm …the results from the present study offer some support that integrating HR configuration with business strategy Lawler,  2000;  Delaney  &  Huselid,  1996; Harel & Tzafrir, 1999). In the absence of ob- jective  data,  self-reported  measures  are  an acceptable  substitute  and  are  equally  reli- able. Prior research by Dollinger and Golden (1992) showed that organizational perform- ance  rated  by  self-reported  measures  was positively correlated with objective perform- ance indicators. Another limitation is the cross-sectional nature of the study. Causality is difficult to establish. The advantage of having a broad range  of  organizations  is  that  it maximizes variation in the inde- pendent  variables  and  increases the  generalizability  of  the  find- ings. Given the dynamic HR con- figurations and the sustainability of  advantage changes  over  time,  it  requires  a longitudinal analysis.  competitive  To conclude, the results from the present study offer some sup- port that integrating HR configu- ration  with  business  strategy enhances organizational perform- ance,  particularly  for  high-com- mitment-based HR. The adoption of  HR  practices  characterized  by internal  fit  and  external  fit  will promote performance. It provides a foundation to study the impor- tant  HR  strategies  and  organiza- tional  outcomes  in  a  Chinese context.  China’s  status  as  one  of the most attractive business mar- kets  for  foreign  investors  and  the  second largest foreign direct investment recipient in the  world  means  that  its  emergence  in  the global  economy  offers  great  opportunities. For multinational corporations operating in China,  one  of  the  biggest  challenges  is  the management of human resources. The find- ings from this present study offer important insights  for  executives  in  formulating  effec- tive HRM strategies. Managers should take a more  proactive  role  in  effectively  imple- menting  innovative  HR  practices  that  will help them to achieve higher levels of finan- cial  performance  and  ultimately  affect  the bottom line. enhances organizational performance, particularly for high-commitment- based HR.  704 HUMANRESOURCEMANAGEMENT, Winter 2008 IRENE H.
