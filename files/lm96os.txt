Strategy, Environment and Performance in Two Technological Contexts: Contingency Theory in  Korea Jangwoo Lee, Danny Miller Jangwoo Lee School of Economics and Business, Kyungpook National University, Taegu, Korea Danny Miller Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales, Montreal, Canada, and Columbia University, New York, USA Abstract This paper examines the range of application of strategic contingency theory. Its  thesis is  that as technologies and economies become more open to market forces,  the  tenets  of contingency theory become increasingly  relevant.  The Korean economy seemed an ideal venue for testing this  notion as  it  is  very heterogeneous  in  the  effectiveness  of  its  technological  regulation.  Many Korean companies employing traditional technologies are able to benefit from government intervention,  whereas  most of  those  using  emergent technolo- gies &mdash;  even in the same industry &mdash;  are forced to compete internationally and are  very  much more subject  to  competitive  market forces.  We found  that Korean companies using emergent technologies were more likely to do well if  they heeded contingency prescriptions  in making strategy:  specifically,  if they employed innovative and marketing differentiation strategies in uncertain environments and cost leadership strategies  in stable  contexts.  On the other hand, companies that used traditional technologies were less apt to benefit from matching strategy to environment. In short, strategic contingency literature was found to apply more to businesses employing emergent technologies than to those  using  traditional  technologies.  Notions from institutional  and contin- gency theory and from the literature  on cross-cultural management are used to interpret these findings.

In part, this is because its  range of application has not been very well defined (Kim and Lim 1988). Clearly, there are environments in  which tradition and govern- ment intervention make performance more a function of adherence to cultural  or industry  norms rather  than to  any ability  to  tailor  strategy to customer demands or competitive challenges (Orru et  al.  1991).  In other settings, however, adaptation of strategy to environment becomes far  more important  as  there  is  much more exposure  to  competitive market  forces.  Here,  we believe,  strategic  contingency  theory  offers Downloaded from  oss.sagepub.com  at SAGE Publications on December 7, 2012    730 useful advice (Hickson and McMillan 1981; Donaldson 1987; Zeffane 1989). The Korean industrial environment provides an ideal venue for testing these  notions.  Over the  years,  Korea has experienced enonnous eco- nomic growth, in part because of its government’s industrial policy and in  part  because of the  remarkable initiative  of many of its  capitalists. During the  1980s, however, there was a movement towards a less regu- lated economy, especially  in  sectors where the  newer fires employed emergent technologies (Kwak 1981; Cho 1983; Whang 1985: Kim and Hong 1992 ).  In  these more competitive sectors, company and industry performance seem to have become more attributable to astute strategic decision making than to institutional support from government subsid- ies,  regulation or protection (Cho 1983; Whang 1985). Still,  Korea continues to blend the old with the new: tradition and gov- ernment have been effective in regulating and to some degree protecting established technologies,  but companies that employ newer emergent technologies in different niches of the very same industries end up being far  more exposed  to  competitive  market  forces  (Whang  1985;  Lee 1987). Our thesis is  that the strategy-environment relationships advoc- ated by the  strategic contingency theorists  will  be far more important to  performance  in  firms  using  emergent  technologies  than  in  firms employing established technologies. Because several Korean industries employ a mix of the old and new technologies, these represent an ideal sample for our study.  ’  ’ Strategy and Contingency Many researchers have discussed how the fit  or match between strategy and environment can  influence  organizational perfonnance (see,  e.g., Miles and Snow 1978; Porter 1980: Snow and Hrebiniak  1980: Gupta and Govindarajan  1984:  Kim and Lim 1988;  Miller  1988,  1991;  Lee 1989).  Some believe  that  the  same generic  strategy  can  be  equally useful in  a variety of environments. Porter ( 1980,  1985 ),  for example, has argued that cost leadership and differentiation may be implemented quite successfully across a broad gamut of markets and industries. Miles and Snow ( 1978) and Snow and Hrebiniak ( 1980) believe that the same is  true for their defender, prospector and analyser strategies. However, the universal relevance of generic strategies has been called into question by studies  investigating  their  situational  prevalence and appropriateness  (see  Hambrick  1983;  Gupta and Govindarajan  1984; Miller and Friesen 1986; White 1986; Kim and Lim 1988: Miller 1988; Venkatraman and Prescott  1990). These studies have found that  strat- egies have varying utility  in different settings. Miller ( 1988,  1991 ), for example, suggested that  cost leadership would be more advantageous in  stable  rather than in  unstable environments, whereas strategies  that differentiate  offerings  via  effective  marketing  or  innovation  would thrive in  uncertain - i.e.  dynamic and unpredictable - settings.  Fur- Downloaded from  oss.sagepub.com  at SAGE Publications on December 7, 2012    731 thermore,  Miller (1988,  1991) found that the  match between strategy and environment was related to performance, especially in challenging settings. The notion of match is  relevant both to firms that tailor their strategies  to match their environments (Porter  1985; Miller  1988), and to those that choose their market niches to capitalize on their strategic competences (Child  1972; Weick 1979). We expect that  the contradictory observations concerning the  import- ance of match to performance may be attributed at least in part to differ- ences in  the  technological  context.  Some organizations  use emergent technologies that invite competition and expose them to the harsh realit- ies  of the  market.  For them, achieving  an appropriate match between strategy and environment is essential to success. By contrast, other com- panies employ technologies that are so well established, subsidized and protected that adaptation to the market may be less important: for them performance  does  not  depend  as  much on matching  strategy  to  the market environment.  Indeed,  this  distinction  may bear upon the  situ- ational relevance of strategic contingency theory (Hickson and McMil- lan  1981; Donaldson 1987; Miller  1988: Zeffane  1989) versus institu- tional  and  particularistic  views  of  organizations  (Granick  1972; Heydebrand  1973;  Meyer and  Rowan  1977;  Gallie  1978;  Hofstede 1991; Orru et al.  1991). As  we  noted  above,  because  the  Korean  business  environment evidences a striking  contrast between the effectiveness of the  institu- tional protection accorded firms employing traditional versus emergent technologies  (Lee  1995),  it  represents  an  ideal  setting  for  this research. Hypotheses  ’  &dquo; Strategy and Environment  .  _  _  . ,  Types of Strategy There are  many ways of characterizing strategy,  but the  classification scheme that  has received the  most attention  is  that  of Michael Porter (1980,  1985).  Porter’s  differentiation  strategy  has  firms developing  a competitive advantage and gaining customer loyalty through innovative designs or via the uniquely attractive image conferred upon their prod- ucts  by superior marketing.  In  contrast,  finns  pursuing  Porter’s  cost leadership strategy are constantly improving their ability to manufacture at  costs lower than the competition, thereby earning ample profit  mar- gins  at  prices  rivals  would find  punishing.  Porter’s  focus  strategy  is really  a variant of differentiation  or cost leadership applied to  a  nar- rowly  targeted  group  of  customers  for  whom  a  firm  tailors  its products. Dess  and  Davis  ( 1984),  Miller  (1986,  1988),  White (1986)  Murray (1988) and others have criticized Porter’s scheme as being too simple Downloaded from  oss.sagepub.com  at SAGE Publications on December 7, 2012    732 because it  conceals the wide variety of differentiation strategies that are of varying utility under different conditions. Porter ( 1980) also suggests, without much argument or evidence, that differentiation and cost leader- ship  are  mutually  exclusive,  and he  invokes  a  focus  strategy  that  is really just a minor variant of cost leadership or differentiation. In  order  to  address  these  problems,  Miller  ( 1986,  1988)  modified Porter’s  framework.  He posited  two  types  of differentiation  - that based on marketing and similar to Miles and Snow’s (1978) analysers, and that founded on innovation and akin to Miles and Snow’s (1978) prospectors.  Miller  ( 1988 )  measured these  strategies  not  as  absolute types, but as dimensions upon which a firm can score high or low. This paper will use this elaboration of Porter’s strategies - cost leadership, innovative differentiation and marketing differentiation.  Several recent studies  have  already  shown  that  these  strategic  dimensions  have emerged within, and have great relevance to, the Korean business con- text  (Y.  Kim 1986; Kim and Lim 1988; Lee 1989). Relating Strategy to Environment Miller ( 1988, 1991) has demonstrated that the more uncertain the envir- onment, that  is,  the  more dynamic and unpredictable  it  is,  the  more useful it  is  to employ differentiation strategies based on mass marketing or product-market innovation.  Frequent changes in  customers’  tastes and competitors’ offerings demand that firms stay up to date by innovat- ing  a good deal and/or by marketing aggressively  to continually con- vince customers of the advantages of new or existing products. In other words,  uncertainty  demands  a  differentiation  strategy  that  keeps offerings  relevant  and attractive  in  a changing setting.  Related  argu- ments have been made by the likes of Miles and Snow ( 1978),  Snow and Hrebiniak ( 1980),  Hambrick (1983), White (1986) and Venkatra- man and Prescott (1990). In contrast to differentiation, cost leadership would be more appropriate to stable and predictable settings in which economies of manufacturing could be most readily realized. Uncertain and changing settings would require  too many alterations  in products and methods to  allow for the efficiency  required  to  attain  cost  leadership  (Hambrick  1983,  Miller 1988). Conversely, the costs of differentiation would be unlikely to be recouped in  a stable setting where product lines  need not change very much. In  summary, the  arguments and findings  of prior research,  all  in  the American  context,  suggest  that  fit  is  achieved  when marketing  and innovative differentiation vary directly and positively with the level of environmental uncertainty,  and when cost  leadership varies  inversely with the  level of uncertainty. ~  ’- _  Fit and Performance  Strategic contingency theorists maintain that an appropriate fit  between environment and strategy will  result  in  superior performance, broadly defined. Performance, depending on company goals, might be reflected ... Downloaded from  oss.sagepub.com  at SAGE Publications on December 7, 2012    733 by profitability  and growth relative  to competitors, and/or by satisfied customers  and employees.  The rationale  is  simply  that  where  firms deliver goods that  customers value  more highly  than  the  comparable offerings  of rivals,  then  greater  financial  and  personal  rewards  will accrue to the organization and its  employees (Drazin and Van de Ven 1985:  Venkatraman  1989;  Miller  1991).  Conversely,  where perform- ance is  poor, firms will  be induced to realign their strategies  with the environment (Hickson and McMillan 1981; Donaldson  1987; Zeffane 1989). The  arguments  from  strategic  contingency  theory  suggest  the  first hypothesis:  ~  z HI:  The match henveen ,strategy  and environment as defined above is expected to be positively associated with organizational peljormance. The Moderating Influence of Industry Technologies Hypothesis  1  is  a rather gross one. In addition, as  we suggested at the outset,  it  is  insufficiently  contingent,  at  least  in  the  Korean business context,  to  take into account important differences in  the  institutional, competitive and cultural environment caused by firms using emergent versus  established  production technologies.  By technology,  we mean the  processes  used  by  organizations  to  convert  inputs  into  outputs (Khandwalla 1977). These involve knowledge of product design as well as  techniques  of  materials  processing,  manufacturing  and  assembly. Since  the  1960s,  most Korean firms  have  been using  traditional  or mature technologies. These are established, well understood, less valu- able to advanced countries and easy to transfer. However, beginning in the  1980s,  some fimis,  motivated by their  growing R&D  capacities, started  to adopt emergent or developing technologies, these being far more valuable to potential rivals in advanced countries (Bae 1987; Choi 1989). Although the challenges faced by firms employing emergent technolo- gies may well demand an acceptable match between strategy and envir- onment to ensure good performance., firms employing traditional  tech- nologies have been able to benefit from the government’s discretionary interventions. For the latter, the functionalist strategic contingency para- digm may not be very relevant (Cho 1983: Whang 1985). Many firms are so sheltered as to be able to prosper even without effecting a close match between environment and strategy.  This notion is  entirely  con- sistent with the institutional view of organizations (Meyer and Rowan 1977; DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Zucker 1987: Orru et al.  1991) and with the particularistic idea that some cultures vary so much as to nul- lify  the relevance  of contingency paradigms (Granick  1972; Heydeb- rand 1973: Gallie  1978; Hofstede 1991). There are several reasons why differences in the technological setting,  in particular, can influence the applicability of strategic contingency theory. Downloaded from  oss.sagepub.com  at SAGE Publications on December 7, 2012    734 Domestic Competition Technologies in  flux demand a lot  of managerial vigilance (Clark and Fujimoto 1991). When methods are still evolving, firms need to remain alert  to  their competitors’  advances. They must be careful  not to  fall behind. This makes it  more likely  that competitors will  react  to  each other along a number of fronts and will try hard to align their strategies to the challenges of the environment. Such increased competition puts pressure  on all  fimis  to  adapt  in  order  to  succeed.  Of course,  these forces of competition will be reduced where established technologies render  managers  more complacent (Milliken  and Lant  1991).  Under such munificent conditions, success may be achieved with a less perfect matching of strategy and environment. Technology Transfer Korean firms employing traditional technologies are often able to obtain these processes quite easily from abroad - from organizations that no longer derive  much competitive advantage from such established  and commonly used methods. This gives the borrowing companies some- thing of a free  ride  as they avoid the costs of having to develop new processes. More importantly, in competing locally, using foreign tech- nologies, firms do very little  to tailor their approaches to their markets, and this is also true for their competitors. Technology transfer standard- izes  industry methods, and to  some degree, products.  Firms and their rivals may be driven by norms and standards legitimized by prestigious foreign companies and endorsed by the  Korean government, but they are  less  influenced by the special  needs of clients  (Meyer and Rowan 1977;  DiMaggi  and  Powell  1983;  Zucker  1987).  This  reduces  the dimensions along which firms compete (DiMaggio and Powell  1983). Hence, there is  less  latitude  or pressure to adapt to  customers if tech- nology is  well established. However, companies in  developed countries  are  reluctant  to  transfer emergent  technologies  from  which  they  still  obtain  major strategic advantages.  Korean  firms  wishing  to  use  these  new  methods  must develop them for themselves, and so must their competitors. This makes for a good deal of competitive pressure and variety that forces firms to adapt their methods and outputs to  market needs (Clark and Fujimoto 1991). Here, any failure to adapt strategy to the demands of the environ- ment can have serious consequences for performance. Effectiveness of Government Policy Korean firms employing traditional technologies have received a good deal of government support over the  years (Shin  1984;  L.  Kim 1986; Bae  1987;  Lee  1989;  Steers et  al.  1989;  Orru et  al.  1991).  They are given incentives to borrow methods and processes from foreign compet- itors, receive much in the way of government funds and loan guarantees, and often benefit  from tariffs  and favourable import-substitution pol- icies that bring them quasi-monopolistic status. This allows these firms Downloaded from  oss.sagepub.com  at SAGE Publications on December 7, 2012    735 to  build up slack  resources  and  to  do well  for  long periods  of time without having to do much adjusting to the environment. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that the impact of strategy on performance is  weak in  such  quasi-regulated  settings  (Fruhan  1972:  Lenz  1980;  Lee 1989). Where technologies are changing very quickly, however, the  govern- ment cannot be as effective in protecting the local market since techno- logies  are  in  a state  of flux.  Here the play of free markets dominates, and the  resulting  local  and international  competition  invokes  a  good deal of pressure for adaptation (Lee  1989: Steers et al.  1989). Indeed, when many firms are striving avidly to  serve a market, it  is  especially necessary to  tailor  strategies  and offerings  to  the  needs of clients.  A good match between strategy  and environment will  be  needed under competitive  conditions  to  ensure  good  performance  (Khandwalla 1977 ). The above arguments give rise  to the following hypothesis: . H2:  The relationship  hetzveen strategy-environment match and per- f01’1)lailC’P will be stronger in industries with emergent technologies than lil  industries with tr-aditional technologies. It  should  be  noted  that  the  notions  of uncertainty  and technological context  are quite  different.  Many firms that operate  within traditional technological contexts confront a good deal of uncertainty from great fluctuations  in  supplies,  costs,  prices  and product  lines.  Conversely, some organizations  using  emergent technologies  operate  in  environ- ments with greater stability in product lines and cost structures. This is especially true among the Korean machinery manufacturers who license foreign technologies. In general, emergent technologies will be subject to more free market forces and thus to more technological competitive pressure than will traditional technologies, but this is  not to suggest that such emergent technologies invoke other forms of uncertainty. Method  .  °... ’ ’  <.  ; ~  ’  , _  Sample  The population of this  study consisted of 870 Korean manufacturing firms from five major industrial sectors of the economy: textiles, chem- icals, machinery, fabricated metal and electronics. These industries were selected for three reasons. First, they were shown to play a key role in the rapid growth of the Korean economy (L.  Kim 1986). Second, they reflected,  about  evenly,  both  traditional  and emergent  technologies. Third, they  each encompassed a large  number of firms.  Government enterprises were avoided in  the sample. Given that  our intention  was to study Korean management practices, Downloaded from  oss.sagepub.com  at SAGE Publications on December 7, 2012    736 no foreign companies were sampled. Also, because our arguments apply mostly  to  non-trivial  organizations,  only  firms  of 200 employees  or more were targeted. Finally, since we were interested in business-level rather  than  corporate-level  strategy,  companies  were  selected  where over 70 percent of sales came from a single business and where no unit engaged in  business  other  than  that  related  to  the  dominant business (Rumelt  1974). The questionnaire was sent out to all 870 firms in the five chosen indus- tries  listed  in  the  Annual Report of Korean Firms published by  the Korea Productivity Center (1990).  Questionnaires  were completed by the general manager or director general of the companies: these are the Korean top executives who would normally be the most familiar with the strategies and markets of their firms. Responses were received from 193 firms (22.2 percent), but, of these, 23 companies provided incomplete responses or responses from insuf- ficiently  senior executives,  and  19 firms  were excessively diversified. These companies  were excluded  from  the  sample.  The final  sample consisted  of  151  fimis:  37  textile  firms,  33  chemical  producers,  16 machinery manufacturers,  13 fabricated metals producers and 52 elec- trical  and electronics firms. We determined that  17 of the  151 respondents were members of power- ful  industrial  groups  known as  chaehols.  Such organizations  used to have advantages due to government protection and greater availability of capital.  Recent studies,  however, have shown that,  since  the  mid- 1980s, chaebol firms have not fared any better than their counterparts in  the  same industries  (Cho  1990;  Kim 1992;  Kim and Hong 1992). Nonetheless, to guard against any biases we ran all  our analyses with and  without  the  chaehol  companies.  The  analyses  shown  in  the Appendix exclude  the  chaebol companies  and they  replicate,  almost perfectly, those of Table 3. In order to ensure that responding firms were not systematically differ- ent from non-respondents, we made special efforts to obtain data from 24 non-responding fimis.  We did not  find  any statistically  significant difference between these  two groups of respondents along any of our five  variables:  the t-values were -0.45,  1.34, 0.30, 0.62,  1.29, respect- ively, for uncertainty, cost leadership, marketing differentiation, innov- ative differentiation and performance. We also  obtained industry-wide  data  on company size  and return  on assets and compared these to the information on the firms in our sample. Again, there were few systematic differences between the samples (cf. Table 1 C). These data are tentative, however, as industry averages vary according to the Korean databases used. Firms were classified into two groups according to the maturity of their technology, using a five-category scale. The emergent technology group consisted of firms  whose executives  agreed that:  (1)  three  years  had not yet passed since their dominant technology was first developed and commercialized; or (2) their technology is  used in developed countries Downloaded from  oss.sagepub.com  at SAGE Publications on December 7, 2012    737 but has not yet been diffused into developing countries. The traditional technology group consisted of firms whose executives stated  that:  (3) the technology has already begun to diffuse into developing countries; (4)  the technology is  being widely used in developing countries;  and (5) the technology has diffused into even the least developed countries (see Bae 1987). ;  _  ,  .;.... , _ :  .-= -,: Measures  .  ~  ,’.. &dquo;  -  ,  - ,  ,  , All measurement scales were based upon previous studies and translated into  Korean.  They are  presented  in  the  Appendix. To determine  the objectivity  of the  responses,  we calculated  inter-r-ater  reliabilities  for all  our variables using a random subsample of 20 firms from which we obtained another respondent. This party was also  an upper-level  man- ager.  There was no consultation  between the  two respondents of any one firm  as  the  pollings  were done at different  times.  The inter--r-uter correlations for the 20 pairs of respondents were as follows: for uncer- tainty  0.813  (p = 0.000),  cost  leadership  0.482  (p = 0.01 ),  marketing differentiation 0.789 ( p = 0.000),  innovative differentiation 0.552 ( p = 0.006) and performance 0.671  (p = 0.001 ). ’  ’ -’,  ’  Environmental Uncertainty  The literature  on organizations  stresses  the importance of uncertainty as a critical variable to which firms must adapt their strategies in order to  perform  well  (Bums and  Stalker  1961:  Duncan  1972;  Miles  and Snow 1978; Miller 1986, 1988). Uncertainty was assessed as the mean of four anchored seven-point Likert scale  items adapted from Khand- walla (1977) and Miller (1988) - these  included the  rate  of product obsolescence, the frequency of changes in technology and in the prices of supplies, and the length of the product life-cycle. The Cronbach alpha reliability  for the uncertainty variable (Table  1)  was 0.56. ;~ .  ,  ,¡:.. ~  .’:  .. ,  I ,  ’ &dquo;  Strategy  Recent  research  (Miller  1988,  1991)  has  provided  conceptual  and empirical support for Miller’s (1986) elaborated and refined version of Porter’s  (1980,  1985) generic  strategies.  (The dimension of focus  or scope was irrelevant to this study as all  firms  were focused.) > To measure Miller’s  (1986)  strategy  dimensions, this  study  used the scales of Y. Kim (1986) and J.  Lee (1989). These scales were adapted from Dess and Davis (1984) and Miller and Friesen (1986) to  make them suitable for Korean manufacturers. Marketing differentiation was gauged by three items assessing the relative strengths ( 1’1S-a-l’1S leading competitors)  of  a  company’s brand image,  advertising  intensity  and marketing  channels.  Innovative  differentiation  was  reflected  by  two investment and success in new product develop- items measuring R&D  Downloaded from  oss.sagepub.com  at SAGE Publications on December 7, 2012    738 ment (vis-a-vis leading competitors). Cost leadership was measured by two items gauging (uis-a-vis leading competitors) cost reduction efforts and price-cutting ability.  All these items were gauged using anchored seven-point Likert scales. The relevant subsets of items were averaged to yield the variables of marketing differentiation, innovative differenti- ation and cost leadership. The Cronbach alpha reliabilities reported in Table  1  were all  acceptable.  Note that  the  three  strategy  dimensions are  not mutually exclusive. The same firm can score high (or low) on all  of them. Performance  ’  ’  .  ~  . _ Performance was measured using the approach suggested by Gupta and Govindarajan (1984). Because of the variety of industries and compan- ies  included  in  our sample,  and  because  the  goals  and performance criteria of these companies differ,  we were required to  use a relative, multidimensional and subjective assessment of performance rather than a narrow financial indicator. A two-stage rating system was employed. First, the importance of seven performance factors was rated by the top executives  of each firm  along five-point  scales:  these  included sales, income and market share growth, return on fixed assets, success in new product development, employee morale and employee welfare.  These seven performance  factors  were deemed to  be especially  relevant  to Korean firms (Steers et al.  1989). We calculated a percentage weighting for each importance scale by dividing the item score by the total of all importance scores for a given company. Second, executives were asked to score, again on five-point scales, how well their firms did along each of these  seven performance factors.  Performance  was summarized as the sum of the products of importance weighting and achievement levels (the  type  of weighted average  endorsed by Gupta and Govindarajan 1984;  Ramanujam et  al.  1986;  and Govindarajan  1988).  The correla- tions among the performance subscales are presented in the Appendix (Cronbach alpha = 0.88). This  subjective  multidimensional  measure  is  preferable  to  return  on assets (ROA) figures,  in  part  because ROA is  distorted by accounting procedures  intended to  assuage  bankers  and shareholders during bad years, and to reduce taxes during good years (P.  Lee 1987; Park 1987; J.  Lee 1989; J.  Lee et al.  1993). Also, there is  a good deal of variation among Korean companies and among industries in depreciation policies and in the asset and inventory evaluation methods used (Lee 1992; Lee and Ban 1992). Given the unreliability of ROA we decided not to use it  in  our analyses. ROA also fails  to reflect other important aspects of performance, such as growth, market performance and employee wel- fare. It is hardly surprising, then, that return on assets as reported in the Korean Productivity Center data correlated  with our own mutifaceted performance index at  only 0.25  (p = 0.003).  ROA differed somewhat in  our sampled firms  across  our five  industries:  fabricated metal and Downloaded from  oss.sagepub.com  at SAGE Publications on December 7, 2012    739 machinery producers scored somewhat higher than average, and elec- trical and electronics firms somewhat below average. These differences, however, were not statistically significant. =  ,~;.3:., .~~ ..  ’ &dquo;.: Match Indexes  ’ ’  ’  ’ The notion of fit  or ’match’ can be made quite concrete. Where normat- ive  arguments  suggest  a positive  relationship  between environmental uncertainty and a dimension of strategy, ’misfit’ can be operationalized as  the  Euclidean  distance  between  the  standardized  scores  of  the strategy  dimensions and uncertainty  (Drazin  and Van de  Ven  1985; Venkatraman  1989).  The normative literature  argues that high  uncer- tainty requires much innovation, whereas low uncertainty demands little innovation.  Departures  from  this  prescription  would  then  occur,  for example, when a firm has low uncertainty and high innovation, or high uncertainty  but  low  innovation.  Moreover,  for  a  given  level  of uncertainty, too much innovation would contribute as much to the mis- match score  as  too  little.  Such  ’mismatches’  can be  reflected  by the arithmetic differences between the scores of the uncertainty and innova- tion variables.  For cost leadership, where an inverse relationship with uncertainty  is  advocated by the  literature,  the polarity  of the  strategy scale  can be  reversed  before differencing  to  ensure consistency  with the  other components of the  index.  Our mismatch index is  based on such  differences  between  uncertainty  and  each  of  the  strategy measures. Our index resembles that of Miller (1991: 43).  It  measures mismatch or  lack  of fit  according  to  departures (squared differences)  from the norms posited for uncertainty-strategy match by the contingency literat- ure that we discussed above. The index was computed for each firm as follows:  . ,  ~  :1:  &dquo;  &dquo; .. ,  where .~  and y are scores standardized across the sample for the one (i ) environmental uncertainty variable and the three U) strategic variables, respectively, and A is  the set of three pairs of environmental and strat- egy variables specified by the match relationships of Hypothesis 1  (i.e. uncertainty with cost leadership, uncertainty with marketing differenti- ation  and  uncertainty  with  innovative  differentiation).  All  variables were standardized across the entire sample to have mean 0 and standard deviation  1  so  as  to  weight  each  equally  in  the  index  (Pennings 1987). Each component of mismatch is simply the squared difference between the standardized scores of a pair of environmental and strategy variables specified by the match relationships of Hypothesis 1  - recall that these posited  a  positive  relationship  between both differentiation  strategies and uncertainty,  and  a negative  relationship  between cost  leadership and uncertainty. The negative relationship required that the seven-point Downloaded from  oss.sagepub.com  at SAGE Publications on December 7, 2012    740 Table  1 A  Descriptive Statistics strategy  scales be inverted before standardization  so that  1  became 7, 2 became 6, etc.  All three mismatch components were summed to give the total mismatch index for each firm, which was then made negative (i.e.  reverse-scored) to yield the match index. Differences were squared because large differences are typically more indicative of an important misalignment than  small  ones (Pennings  1987;  Miller  1991).  In  fact, small differences often represent sampling noise rather than systematic variation. Our mismatch index  has  several  advantages.  First,  it  aggregates  the individual components of match between strategy and environment to yield a convenient summary measure. Drazin and Van de Ven (1985) and  Venkatraman  (1989)  claim  that  such  measures  are  superior  to indexes  assessing  only  one  component  of  mismatch.  Second,  the indexes do not rely on an average (e.g. regression) baseline from which to  calculate mismatch, but rather define  it  according to  the  normative literature  invoked by Hypothesis  1.  Finally,  we have not taken match to  be an alignment with the profile  of the highest performers.  Such a measure might yield a baseline having little  to do with the hypotheses of strategic contingency theory and would imply a tautological relation- ship that would make it  impossible to test Hypotheses 1  and 2 (Miller 1991).

Match is slightly higher for the emergent subsample than the traditional one (p <  0.06),  but  this  is  not  borne  out  by  the  individual  industry comparisons of Table  1 B.  Recall from Hypothesis 2 that  firms using traditional technologies were not expected to be under as much pressure to match environment and strategy. Table  1B  confirms  that  firms  employing  emergent  technologies  do not  face  more  uncertainty,  at  least  in  product  life-cycles  and  cost structures,  than  those  using  traditional  technologies  (although  the former are  subject  to  greater  market  forces  and  more competition). Indeed, the one significant difference in our uncertainty measure occurs in the electronics industry, where firms employing traditional technolo- gies face mor-e uncertainty  than their  counterparts  who use emerging technologies.  At  the  intra-industry  level,  firms  employing  emergent versus  traditional  technologies  do  not  usually  differ  significantly along  any  of  the  environmental,  strategy,  match  or  performance variables. Hypothesis 1  ’ Table 2  indicates that  the  match between strategy  and environment is indeed associated with superior performance. The Pearson correlation between  performance  and  match  was  0.21  (p <  0.05)  for  the  total sample, confirming Hypothesis  1.  However, anticipating Hypothesis 2, this relationship was 0.46 (p <  0.01) for the emergent technology sub- sample and only 0.16 (p <  0.10) for the subsample of traditional tech- nology firms. Table 2 also indicates that all strategies were positively correlated with performance at  beyond the  0.05  level.  However, these  results  are  of little  importance  since  most of the  relationships  disappear  when we Downloaded from  oss.sagepub.com  at SAGE Publications on December 7, 2012    743 Table ? 2 Correlation Matrix 1  1 Table 3  Multiple Regression Analyses for Performance * and ** indicate findings  at  beyond the  0.05 and 0.01  levels,  respectively,  under a two-tailed test.  .  _  ~ _  ~  _ control for environmental uncertainty, technology, the other strategies, and strategy-environment match (Table 3). It is interesting that all strategies were positively correlated, confimiing the findings of Miller (1988) and others that  our strategy dimensions are by no means mutually exclusive. Product innovations, for example, may prompt managers to place more emphasis on marketing to convince potential customers of the benefits of the  new offerings. Table 2 also reveals that the correlation between strategies and environ- mental uncertainty are low, suggesting that the environmental imperat- ive  is  by no means universally compelling. .  . ;  .

Hypothesis 2  According to Hypothesis 2,  the relationship between strategy-environ- ment match and performance would be higher among firms using emer- gent technologies than  among firms  using  traditional  technologies.  In order  to  test  this  hypothesis,  we regressed  performance  on  match,  a technology dummy variable (emergent = 0, traditional = 1 ),  and a prod- uct  interaction  of the  latter  variables.  Environmental uncertainty  and each  of  the  three  strategy  dimensions  were  included  as  control variables. Table 3  shows that  the relationships between match and performance are stronger for the emergent than for the traditional technological set- tings.  The significant  result  for  the  interaction  term confirms that  the findings are stronger for the emergent technology setting, and this result is  confirmed by the individual regression analyses for each of the sub- samples.  Indeed,  the  findings  confirm  that  match is  not  a  significant predictor of performance in  the  traditional  technology sample. Hypo- thesis  2 is  supported. In contrast with the bivariate results of Table 2, Table 3 indicates that, as  a rule,  strategy does not predict performance when we control  for match,  technology  and  the  other  strategy  dimensions.  This  may be because the strategy variables correlate positively with one another and this  reduces  their  individual  effects  in  the  multiple  regression analyses. Even in Table 3, however, innovative differentiation is  associated with success in traditional technology contexts, which, as we have seen, are sometimes more uncertain  than emergent technology contexts  (Table 1 B >.  One reason for this relationship has been provided by Lee ( 1989), capabilities are espe- who has shown that Korean firms that have R&D  cially likely to obtain competitive advantages by making small innova- tions  that fine-tune their mature technologies. In  comparing  Tables  2  and  3  we also  find  that  match  becomes  a somewhat more important predictor of performance in  the latter table. Table 3  factors  out the  spurious effects  of the  strategies  and controls for technology. However, even in Table 3,  there is  no significant rela- tionship between match and performance for the traditional technology subsample. ,  Conclusion  ,  .  j  ,  ,  .. , The applicability  of strategic  contingency theory  appears  to  be  very much a  function  of the  technological  setting  and  its  relationship  to market forces and industrial policy (Granick 1972; Hickson et al.  1974; Donaldson 1987). In the Korean context, many firms using established, traditional technologies benefit from a number of cultural  and institu- tional  factors that  come into play to decrease competition and protect Downloaded from  oss.sagepub.com  at SAGE Publications on December 7, 2012    745 firms from the need to adapt.  Firms are able  to succeed because they obtain help from the  government in  the  form of subsidies,  tariffs  and even technological assistance.  This protection  allows organizations to do well  even if  they  have  not  followed  the  recommendations of the strategic  contingency  theorists  in  matching  strategy  to  environment. Indeed, a tirm’s success in achieving a ’good’ strategy-customer match may confer far less competitive advantage than its  success in obtaining government  help  by  embracing  legitimated  technological  norms.  In these  instances,  the  resource dependence (Pfeffer  and Salancik  1978) or even the institutional (DiMaggio and Powell 1983; Orru et al.  1991) > paradigms may be of greater relevance than functionalist contingency theories.  The  procurement  of  resources  and  government  support becomes  crucial  to  organizational  viability.  These  assets  can  be obtained more readily via cooptation, politicking, lobbying, legitimacy building and conformity rituals  than by 1ailoring  strategy  to  environ- ment in  the  manner envisioned by functionalists. Although  some institutionalists  argue  for  strategic  isomorphism,  our results  do not  show that  strategies  are  the  same among firms  in  an industry where traditional technologies are used. There seems to be as much strategic  variety  in  our emergent as  in  our traditional  samples. Indeed, isomorphism may be absent in traditional settings where man- agers,  so long  as they  adhere  to  government guidelines  and industry technology norms, may choose from a wide range of strategies. Thus, institutional effects may be limited to the adoption of select rituals  or policies rather than embracing a wide set of strategic or structural attrib- utes (Donaldson  1975: 79-128). It appears that contingency notions apply more robustly to Korean com- panies  that  employ  emergent  technologies.  Here,  market  forces  are allowed to operate: competition is  fierce, methods and product lines are in  a state  of flux  and government protectionist intervention  is  usually ineffective. Firms are only able to succeed if they adapt their strategies to the needs of the marketplace. In short,  the contingency paradigm is predictive mostly when firms face the competitive environments typic- ally associated with emerging technologies. One of the limitations of this research is that it  did not directly measure the  level  of government protectionism.  We believe  that  future  studies testing contingency theory in developing economies would indeed bene- fit  from the  inclusion of such a potential moderating variable. It  would be  useful  also  to  do more research  on other organizational variables that might determine the differential application of the various organizational  paradigms.  Such  studies  can  serve  as  a  basis  for  a middle-range approach that  leads  to  more cumulative findings (Miller and Friesen  1984). It might also be helpful to conduct research in other cultural settings  to establish whether Hickson et  al.’s  (1974)  ’culture- free’  thesis  holds:  that  is,  to  determine if  the relationships  we found among our organizational and contingency variables hold in other coun- tries  (Granick 1972; Heydebrand 1973; Hofstede 1991).
