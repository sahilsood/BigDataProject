Proposition and Test of a Causal Model** This research aims at clarifying the links which may exist between human resource management practices and economic performance of firms. To this end, a theoretical model of an exploratory nature is proposed, based on the hypothesis of the existence of cascading relationships between three categories of performance: social, organizational and economic. The model is applied to a sample of almost 300 French small and mid-sized firms. The principal hypotheses put forth within the context of this study are to a large degree validated. This allows the formulation of interesting recommendations for managers and opens new ways for scholars pursuing this line of research.

According to the survey carried out by Fritz (1992), HRM is today  mentioned  in  50%  of  research  papers  concerned  with  the  factors  of  success. Moreover, HRM’s contributions to the explanation of gaps in performance is far from marginal.  For  instance,  through  the  analysis  of  144  firms  representative  of  German industry, Fritz (ibid) noted that, contrary to his hypothesis, HRM choices better explain the  variability  of  performances  than  do  marketing  decisions.  Clearly,  the  increasing ability of HRM to explain gaps in performances is tied to the fact that less and less research contributions ignore this variable. One of the sources of this evolution can be traced  to  analyses  of  the  German  and  Japanese  „economic  miracles”.  Indeed,  these studies demonstrated that the performances of German and Japanese firms are partly due  to  their  particular  models  of  industrial  relations  and  of  HRM  (Hayes/Abernathy 1980; Pascale/Athos 1981; Prais 1981; Limprecht/Hayes 1983; Weiss 1984; Maurice/ Sorge  1989).  Consequently,  HRM  is  considered  today  as  a  potential  source  of competitive  advantage  (Fombrun,  Devanna/Tichy  1984;  Baird/Meshoulam  1988; Barney 1991; Wright, McMahan/McWilliams 1994) and this fact explain the increasing interest in HRM. However, the empirical results concerning the link between HRM practices and performances  are  often  of  contradictory  nature.  For  instance,  Miller/Monge  (1986) Wagner/Gooding (1987) and Cotton et al. (1988) have traced several dozen studies with conflicting conclusions as to the effects that employee participation and job satisfaction have on performance. A hypothesis emerged to explain the conflicting conclusions. This hypothesis leads to distinguish two particular systems of HRM. The first system, known as „control ” (Arthur 1994) or „technical” (Huselid et al. 1997) consists of considering workers as a source of costs, which are to be minimized (Rosen/Quarrey 1987; Kravetz 1988;  Hansen/Wernerfelt  1989;  Grinyer  et  al.  1990).  The  second  system,  known  as „commitment”  (Arthur,  ibid)  or  „strategic”  (Huselid  et  al.,  ibid),  is  based  on  the perception of people as a „resource” or „value” to develop and to motivate, in order to achieve  the  goals  of  the  organization.  These  two  contrasting  approaches  have  been described  recently  by  a  variety  of  authors  (see  for  example  Storey  1992; Mahoney/Watson  1993;  Guest  1995;  Tsui  et  al.  1995;  Garnjost/Wächter  1996).  But several  empirical  studies  have  not  confirm  the  superiority  of  the  strategic  system  of HRM  to  obtain  satisfacting  performances  (Mayer/Schoorman  1992;  Day  1996). Contradictory conclusions are equally obtained in Europe. For instance, in Germany, one of the principal tools of the „strategic” perspective of HRM, the co-management, appears  to  be  an  ambivalent  instrument.  Indeed,  according  to  Gaugler  (1986),  co- management has a positive influence on the performance of thriving firms but tends to amplify difficulties of firms going through a crisis. Likewise, contrasting conclusions are formulated in Germany on the impact employee profit sharing has on performance (Wächter/Koch  1993).  As  for  the  French  case,  research  by  Reyes  Garcia  (1985), Savall/Zardet (1987) and Liouville/Bayad (1993) confirm the hypothesis of the positive Liouville, Bayad: Human Resource Management and Performances (ZfP 3/98)                                               339 impact  of  strategic  HRM  on  performance,  whereas  the  results  of  Allouche/Krausz (1984), d’Arcimoles (1992) and Schmidt (1993) do not lead to similar conclusions. Thus, with the aim of clarifying this question, the first part of the study presents a theoretical model. The second part discloses the research methodology and the third part exposes the empirical results obtained which are then commented. 1.  Framework for a model The  non-convergence  of  conclusions  as  to  the  impact  of  HRM  systems  on performances  is  partly  due  to  the  fact  that  the  indicators  considered  are  not  always identical.  Moreover,  when  different  authors  use  the  same  indicator  the  measurement mode of the indicator varies from one study to another (Leana et al. 1990). In an attempt to resolve the problem of indicators, a testable model distinguishing several levels of performance is proposed. The elaborated model depicts three levels of performance. The model is based on the hypothesis of the existence of links between these three levels (see Figure 1). The presumed links are the following: organizational performances are dependent on social performances  which  are  in  turn  determined  by  HRM  practices.  The  underlying hypothesis is that the aforementioned are driven by employee motivation, this last factor having a significant impact on the level of services delivered by the personnel and thus on economic performances, by way of organizational performances. In short, this model is coherent  with  works  concluding  that  the  motivation  and  implication  of  employees contribute to the efficiency of the firm (Côté/Sega 1980; Gelinier 1984; Kieser/Kubicek 1992).

By way of the cascade effect, economic performances should also be improved contributing thus to a greater competitiveness for the firm by way of investment policy (de Woot 1988; Zahra/Covin 1993). In Summary, this model contrasts with the traditional view of the link between HRM and economic performances. The present model adheres to the socio-economic view and suggests that there is not a direct interdependence between HRM and economic performances. Finally, this model must be tested to see if it corresponds to the reality, with the results leading to the formulation of recommendations for management. 2.  Methodology 2.1 Selection and construction of variables So as to identify different HRM systems twelve items are pooled derived from a variety of sources, including Hornsby/Kurato (1990), Osterman (1994), Pfeffer (1994), Arthur  (1994),  Huselid  et  al.  (1997).  This  12  items  allow  to  make  the  distinction between  the  practices  that  reflect  the  technical  and  the  strategic  perspectives  of  the HRM. Six items described the strategic approach and six items the technical approach. The strategic HRM variables are: employee education and training -  empowerment -  communication -  employee participation -  promoting personnel and managing careers -  improving working conditions. -  The technical HRM variables are: compensation (wages) -  personnel planning -  recruitment -  assessing employee attitudes and performance appraisal -  -  minimizing absenteeism -  developing the flexibility of the personnel. With  the  aim  of  analyzing  the  influence  of  HRM  on  performances,  the performances  are  traced  at  each  level  through  the  aid  of  several  variables,  with consideration of possible biases, thus avoiding the risk associated with reliance on one single variable (Kaplan/Norton 1992). In evaluating social performances, which in the model play the role of motivation and implication indicators, three variables are selected: employee turnover, absenteeism and job satisfaction, with a distinction being made for this last variable between the managers and the rest of the employees. The choice of personnel turnover is justified by the  fact  that  a  negative  and  significant  correlation  is  generally  observed  between intrinsic satisfaction and this variable (Lucas et al. 1987). The inclusion of absenteeism is explained by the fact that it is another classic indicator of job satisfaction (Weber et Liouville, Bayad: Human Resource Management and Performances (ZfP 3/98)                                               341 al. 1993). These two variables, extracts of social data are complimented by a variable of satisfaction of the employees. Organizational performances are measured through productivity, quality and new product development (innovation-product). Productivity as a cost indicator is a classic variable  of  organizational  performance  (Prais  1981).  Moreover,  at  a  time  when competition from countries with low wages is on the increase, growth in productivity becomes  a  condition  of  survival  of  firms.  According  to  the  model’s  hypotheses  if logically one considers productivity as a determinant of economic performances then clearly this variable is influenced by social performances. In this way, an increase in yield is not only hindered by absenteeism (Prais 1981; Weiss 1984), but also by a high turnover which has an effect on personnel qualification and experience as well as on productivity. The choice of quality of production, as evaluated through the capacity of products and services to satisfy clients, and through costs associated with inefficient production (hidden costs as described by Savall and Zardet, ibid.), is justified by the fact that it is another classic factor of organizational performance (Budde et al. 1982). Just as a lack of implication could have negative effects on quality, a general concensus exists today as  to  the  decisive  role  played  by  product  quality  in  acquiring  competitive  advantage favorable to a rise in profitability and market share (Jacobson and Aaker 1987; Kaplan and Norton ibid.; Tarondeau 1993; Wildemann 1993). With  consideration  to  today's  shortened  product  life  cycle  (Gemünden  1992; Tarondeau,  ibid.;  Wildemann,  ibid.),  a  firm  that  does  not  develop  its  capacity  for innovation runs the risk of marketing only products in the phase of decline and thus generating a total revenue tending toward zero. Consequently it seems coherent to select the  variable  „new  products  on  the  market“  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  the organization  and  more  generally  the  capacity  of  the  organization  to  guarantee  its survival.  The  influence  of  product-innovation  on  economic  performance  is  less apprehensible  to  the  extent  that  the  profits  generated  from  resources  allocated  to innovation  are  dependent  in  part  on  entry  barriers  set  up  by  the  innovator  (Schewe 1992).  Despite  this  observation,  it  is  possible  to  adhere  to  the  hypothesis  of  the existence  of  a  positive  link  between  the  volume  of  innovations  and  economic performance (for an inventory on this subject see Gierl and Kotzbauer 1992). As  for  the  indicators  of  economic  performances,  the  three  variables  most  often used  in  the  business  world  (Buckley  et  al.  1988)  are  selected:  profitability,  rate  of growth of sales, clients and market share. 2.2 Presentation of sample The sample analyzed is composed of small and mid-sized industrial firms situated in Eastern France having accepted to participate in the study. Initially 650 small and mid-sized firms (between 6 and 500 employees) representative of regional industries of small and mid-sized firms (randomly selected and categorized according to size) were contacted.  Approximately  300  firms  replied  and  for  the  purpose  of  creating  a homogenous sample, 271 of these were retained. Interviews were conducted with the 342                                               Liouville, Bayad: Human Resource Management and Performances (ZfP 3/98) general managers of these firms. These general managers where asked on their HRM practices and on the performances of their firm. The majority of these small and mid-sized industrial firms are of a modest size as 81% of the firms of the sample had between 6 and 99 employees, the others having between 100 and 500 employees. As for the principle activity, 42 % of the companies were classified in the sector of consumer non food goods, 29 % in the intermediary goods sector and 21% in machinery and equipment while the remaining firms belonged to the agriculture and food sector. Finally 75% of the firms were independent and considered themselves as family firms whereas the rest were subsidiaries of French or foreign groups. These characteristics contribute to the portrayal of a relative homogeneity between firms of the sample (same geographic environment, proximity in size and belonging to the same secondary sector) which is conducive to confirming the stability of the results. The  focus  on  SME’s  is  due  to  the  fact  that  within  large  firms  different  groups implement human resource activities in many factories. This implies that heteregeneous HRM practices may be applied in different parts of these firms (Snell and Dean 1992). Consequently, the data collected in such firms may not reflect this complex reality. In contrast, the risk that such biases appear in collecting HRM data of SME’s (which have often a single factory) is lower. 2.3 Modalities of Performance Measurement According  to  the  proposed  theoretical  model,  4  categories  of  variables  were selected (see Annex 1). On the basis of the replies obtained, a score is calculated for each  of  the  categories,  the  objective  being  to  design  a  synthetic  indicator  of  HRM practices as well as a synthetic indicator for each category of performances (see Annex 1). In fact a firm's score, for each one of these indicators, corresponds to the sum (not normalized)  of  the  values  affected  to  each  modality  of  response  (see  Table  1).  This procedure is justified by the desire to avoid results derived from a single variable and most  notably  to  give  a  certain  homogeneity  and  comparability  to  the  performances indicators. In order to verify the consistency of the synthetic indicators, tests were conducted using Cronbach's alpha method. This method is used to evaluate the coherence existing between  the  components  of  each  synthetic  indicator  (notions  of  compatibility  and representativeness  of  the  indicator  components).  Table  1  indicates  that  the  values recorded by the alpha coefficient of Cronbach are greater than 0.7 and likewise lead to the  conclusion  that  the  synthetic  indicators  developed  within  the  frame  of  this  study quite  closely  resemble  the  variables  selected.  Indeed  the  threshold  generally  used  to judge the robustness of results is set at 0.6. Liouville, Bayad: Human Resource Management and Performances (ZfP 3/98)                                               343 Table 1.

Principal results 3.1 The Typology of HRM Strategies The  typology  of  HRM  practices  of  firm  general  managers  (HRM  systems)  is obtained  by  using  in  the  software  SAS-STAT  the  ascending  classification  hierarchy (ACH) according to Ward's method. Using optimal dividing (pseudo F value and cubic criteria),  the  ACH  lead  to  a  typology  composed  of  five  classes,  illustrated  in  the following figure. Figure 2 Profiles of the Typology of HRM practices (HRM practices of general managers (CEO) : percentage of responses „quite“ or „very important“ in each class) 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 CL1 CL3 CL4 CL5 CL2 Appraisal Absenteeism Flexibilty Recruitment Training Empowerment Com munication Participation Promotion-Careers Working conditions Compensation Personnel planning 344                                               Liouville, Bayad: Human Resource Management and Performances (ZfP 3/98) the  general  managers  are  sensitive  This  typology  reveals  the  variety  of  combinations  of  HRM  practices  of  general managers which does not emerge through a flat treatment of the data. The typology contrasts with the extremes of class 1 (including 13 firms or 5% of the total analyzed) to those of class 5 (integrating 30 firms or 11% of the sample). More precisely, class 1 is that  which  has  general  managers  who  establish  a  HRM  system  based  on  the  twelve practices (for each practice the answer mode is „quite important“ or „very important“). In contrast, class 5 groups together firms of which the general managers assign little importance  to  HRM  practices  (a  single  item  among  the  twelve  proposed  items accounted  for  50%  of  the  replies  for  the  „quite  important“  or  „very  important“ modalities). Among the intermediary classes (classes 2, 3 and 4), the HRM practices are not homogeneous  either.  For  example,  in  class  2  (representing  95  firms  or  35%  of  the to  questions  about  „training“, sample)  „compensation“,  „motivation“  but  less  interested  in  „personnel  planning“  or  „career management“.  The  general  managers  essentially  interested  in  the  development  of employee „empowerment“ are those in class 3. Finally, class 4 corresponds to those general managers  principally  interested  in  issues  concerning  working  conditions  and training. This would seem to indicate that the general managers perceive productivity development  from  a  technical  point  of  view  but  make  little  effort  to  promote  the motivation of employees. 3.2 Relations between HRM strategies and performances The  first  stage  consisted  of  researching  the  existence  of  a  linear  correlation between the indicators (see Pearson's test, Table 2). The results indicate that the HRM practices (dealt with through the synthetic variable method) are in particular connected with  the  synthetic  criteria  of  social  performances  and  with  economic  performance (significant to 1%). An association appears as well with organizational performances but  to  a  much  lesser  degree  as  the  correlation  coefficient  is  significant  to  10%. Furthermore,  Table  2  illustrates  the  close  links  between  the  synthetic  criteria  of economic  performances  and  all  the  other  criteria  (less  than  1%  significance).  Of particular interest is that the lowest-rated correlation is that which is recorded between the indicator of economic performances and organizational performances.

To this end, an analysis  of  variance  to  a  factor  (ANOVA)  was  carried  out  in  a  second  stage.  The hypothesis on which this analysis is based considers that the proposed HRM typology plays the role of the independent variable in explaining performances. The results of Table 3 indicate a significant influence of HRM on performances. These  results  confirm  more  particularly  that  HRM  exert  a  strong  influence  on  the synthetic  indicator  of  economic  performances  (significant  to  1%)  and  on  social performances (significant to 5%). In the aim of clarifying the results, Duncan's comparison test are conducted (see Table 3). The recorded results confirm that firms in cluster 1 ( high sensitivity to all components of „personnel mix“) had economic results superior to those in other classes. Furthermore, the firms in clusters 2 and 3 of which the general managers demonstrated a  certain  interest  in  the  „strategic  approach“  to  HRM  obtained  better  economic performances  than  did  the  firms  in  clusters  4  and  5  which  were  more  inclined  to implement a technical approach to the management of employees.

The objective of such a procedure is to verify the existence of links between the different levels of performances within each of the identified HRM systems. The results clearly indicate that firms in clusters 1 and 2 (strong strategic HRM orientation)  have  the  characteristic  of  being  the  ones  where  the  correlation  are  the clearest. In firms of clusters 3 and 4, the correlations are less obvious and clear links do not exist between the synthetic indicator of social performances and that of economic performances. In these clusters, the economic performances is essentially conditioned 346                                               Liouville, Bayad: Human Resource Management and Performances (ZfP 3/98) by  the  organizational  performances.  The  analysis  of  cluster  5  firms  reveals  more ambiguous results. It should be noted that within this cluster (such in clusters 3 and 4) there is an absence of link between the synthetic indicator of social performances and that of organizational performances. But inversely, in cluster 5 a weak link emerges between the synthetic indicators of economic and social performances. In fact although this  hypothesis  remains  to  be  verified,  it  seems  that  within  this  class  the  economic results determine in part the social policy.

The model can be considered relatively validated which attributes a certain consistency to the lessons which can be derived from it. These lessons are of two types. Firstly, considering that it has been shown that economic efficiency is dependent on organizational performances, the question at hand is how to bring about satisfactory organizational performance. Table 4 indicates that there exists only one scenario to explain the implication of personnel in contributing to carry out this objective. On the one hand, a strong HRM system  (one  concerned  with  both  strategic  and  technical  HRM)  allows,  with  a  high probability, the bringing about of high organizational performances, which in turn is a guarantee of economic performance. In this way, firms in classes 1 and 2 demonstrating such a concept of HRM benefited from a meshing effect. The chosen HRM options Liouville, Bayad: Human Resource Management and Performances (ZfP 3/98)                                               347 brought  about  innovations  to  competitive  costs,  what  is  a  good  way  to  achieve sustainable leadership in an industry (Porter 1985). On the other hand, in classes 4 and 5, where CEO did not implement a strong HRM system, this is a source of social dysfunction, detrimental to economic success. The second lesson to be retained from this study is derived from the analysis of class 3 where the adopted social strategy corresponds to an impoverished version of participative  management  (with  the  exclusion  of  dynamic  dimensions  such  as  career management). In this case, organizational efficiency is also disconnected from HRM choices. It would be thus advisable for CEO of the firms of this class to focus on their HRM choices in order to raise organizational performances. These choices are founded primarily  on  personal  convictions  out  of  phase  with  the  aspirations  of  people. Consequently,  this  lack  of  coherence  can  be  explained  by  obtained  results  vastly contrasting to those desired. This implies in particular that CEO should be encouraged to  verify  if  their  cognitive  schemas  are  in  phase  with  the  reality  perceived  by  the employees. Finally, this study suggests that the effectiveness of the HRM is the highest when the staff implements a mixed system, including technical and strategic HRM activities of high-quality. This conclusion means that, in opposition to the theoretical hypothesis of Arthur (1994), the firms have to develop both technical and strategic HRM activities to achieve higher performances. This evidence may be explain by the fact that in our sample (French SME’s), the firms generally compete in environments characterized by lower levels of institutionalization for technical HRM activities. Thus, as suggested by Huselid et al. (1997), improvements in this field may be a means to gain competitive advantage. Furthermore, this first assertion leads us to consider that in such contexts (with low technical HRM) the firms may have to achieve at least moderate practices of technical HRM to have the foundation needed to implement strategic HRM activities. This result can explain the contradictory nature of conclusions based on the distinction between technical and strategic practices of HRM. Moreover, despite the fact that our analyses need more in depth investigation in order  this  article  empirically operationalizes and tests central tenets of HRM theory. The article suggests how the HRM  systems  influences  the  economic  performances  of  the  firm,  and  the  „waterfall performance approach”  could  be  a  useful  pathway  for  scholars  pursuing  this  line  of research. In addition, one should note that the results obtained encourage the continuation of this work. A first extension should be to develop and test other hypotheses in order to better understand how the HRM activities lead the firms to success. In this way the test of the set of hypotheses with longitudinal or panel data represents a challenge for future work.  Another  important  extension  of  this  work  would  be  to  consider  not  only  the perceptions of managers but to introduce data reflecting the „effective” perceptions of employees, which means that they should be asked directly. to  make  strong  recommendations  to  managers,  348                                               Liouville, Bayad: Human Resource Management and Performances (ZfP 3/98) References Abernathy  W.
