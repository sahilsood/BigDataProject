B. Lippincott Company  The Performance of Intensive Care Units:  Does Good Management Make a Difference?  STEPHEN  M.  SHORTELL,  PHD,*  JACK E.  ZIMMERMAN, MD,  FCCM,t  DENISE M.  ROUSSEAU,  PHD,*  ROBIN R.  GILLIES, PHD,*  DOUGLAS P.  WAGNER,  PHD,t  ELIZABETH A.  DRAPER,  RN,  MS,t  WILLIAM A.  KNAUS, MD,t  AND JOANNE DUFFY, DNSc,  CCRN?  A significant  portion  of health  care resources  are spent  in intensive  care units  with,  historically,  up to two-fold  variation  in  risk-adjusted  mortality.  Techno-  logical,  demographic,  and social  forces are likely  to lead to an increased  volume  of  intensive  care in  the  future.  Thus,  it  is  important  to  identify  ways  of  more  efficiently  managing  intensive  care units  and reducing  the  variation  in patient  outcomes.  Based on data collected  from 17,440 patients  across 42 ICUs, the pres-  ent study  examines  the factors associated  with  risk-adjusted  mortality,  risk-ad-  justed  average  length  of  stay,  nurse  turnover,  evaluated  technical  quality  of  care, and evaluated  ability  to meet  family  member  needs.  Using  the  Apache  III  methodology  for  risk-adjustment,  findings  reveal  that:  1) technological  avail-  ability  is  significantly  associated  with  lower  risk-adjusted  mortality  (beta  =  -.42);  2)  diagnostic  diversity  is  significantly  associated  with  greater  risk-ad-  justed  mortality  (beta = .46); and 3) caregiver  interaction  comprising  the culture,  leadership,  coordination,  communication,  and conflict  management  abilities  of  the  unit  is significantly  associated  with  lower  risk-adjusted  length  of stay  (beta  = .34), lower  nurse  turnover  (beta  =  -.36),  higher  evaluated  technical  quality  of  care  (beta  =  .81), and  greater  evaluated  ability  to  meet  family  member  needs  (beta  =  .74). Furthermore,  units  with  greater technological  availability  are sig-  nificantly  more  likely  to be  associated  with  hospitals  that  are more  profitable,  involved  in  teaching  activities,  and  have  unit  leaders  actively  participating  in  hospital-wide  quality  improvement  activities.  The  findings  hold  a number  of  important  managerial  and  policy  implications  regarding  technological  adop-  tion,  specialization,  and  the  quality  of  interaction  among  ICU team  members.  They  suggest  intervention  "leverage  points"  for care givers,  managers,  and  ex-  ternal  policy  makers  in  efforts  to continuously  improve  the  outcomes  of inten-  sive  care. Key  words:  continuous  improvement;  health  outcomes;  unit  perfor-  mance.  (Med Care 1994;32:508-525)  As  health  care  reform  in  the  United  States  increased  attention  will  continues  to  evolve,  be  paid  to  reorganizing  the  way  patient  care  is provided.  This  will  involve  a fundamental  restructuring  of  how  health  care  profes-  sionals  relate  (e.g.,  greater  use  of  interdisci-  plinary  health  care  teams)  and  of  how  pro-  508  fessional  work  is  accomplished  (e.g.,  greater  use  of  electronic  databases  and  treatment  protocols).  Managerial  and  organizational  scientists  colleagues  must  join  forces  with  the  biological,  biomedi-  cal,  and  clinical  scientists  for  more  cost-ef-  fective  patient  care  to  be  realized.  their  economic  and  Vol. 32,  No.  5  PERFORMANCE OF  INTENSIVE CARE UNITS  Over the past two decades, there has been  a growing knowledge base identifying mana-  gerial and  organizational  practices that ap-  pear to be associated with better patient out-  comes.l4  Many of  these,  strong leadership,  timely  communication,  and  good  interde-  partmental  coordination  for  example,  are  similar to effective  practices that have  been  found  to be associated with superior perfor-  mance  in  organizations  outside  of  health  care.5-7 Although  the  health  care  specific  studies have  been  helpful,  many  have  been  limited by small sample sizes, an inability to  rigorously  adjust  patient  outcomes  for  dif-  ferences in severity of illness,  an inability to  control for differences in technology,  and a  narrow focus  on  a single  outcome  measure  as  opposed  to  a  broad  array of  indicators  that might better capture the overall perfor-  mance of a given patient care unit or organi-  zation.  The  present  study  attempts  to  ad-  dress these  challenges  by  examining  a rela-  tively large number (n =  42) of patient care  units  (intensive  care units)  throughout  the  United States; employing  recent advances in  severity of illness risk adjustment (APACHE  III); incorporating measures of technological  differences; and examining a broad portfolio  of performance measures including risk-ad-  justed  mortality,  risk-adjusted  length-of-  stay,  nursing  turnover,  evaluated  technical  quality of care, and evaluated ability to meet  * From the Center for Health Services and Policy Re-  search, and the J.L.

The purpose is to ex-  amine the extent to which differences in per-  formance might be  associated with  selected  managerial  and  organizational  practices  over  which  health  care professionals  have  control, thus providing a basis for taking cor-  rective  action  and  achieving  superior  out-  comes.  The  Treatment  Setting  and  Its  Importance  Although  more  health  care services  will  be  delivered  in  nonhospital  settings,  an in-  creasing proportion of  services  that remain  within  the  hospital  will  involve  intensive  care.  It is  conceivable  that  hospitals  in  the  future  largely  will  be  intensive  care units.  How  to  manage  the  resources  associated  with  such  care  will  be  of  growing  impor-  tance  along  with  learning  how  to  produce  better patient outcomes.8 These issues are of  particular significance given  that the cost of  a patient day in an ICU is three to five times  that  of  a day  of  care on  a medical-surgical  floor,9 and  overall  ICU expenditures  repre-  sent approximately  1% of the nation's gross  national  product.10'" In  addition,  the  effi-  cacy  of  intensive  care has  been  called  into  question  for both  patients who  are too well  or too ill to benefit from such treatment.12-15  Further, recent studies have demonstrated a  two  fold  variation  in  risk-adjusted  mortal-  ity.'6-'7 Finally, an ICU is a particularly perti-  nent  setting  for study  because  it is a proto-  type  of  the  highly  interdependent  team-or-  iented  care  that  will  characterize much  of  health care delivery in the future. Being able  to  identify  and  learn about  processes  asso-  ciated with better performance in these units  may  hold  important  lessons  for  other  set-  tings as well.  The  Model  It  is  important  to  consider  performance  from multiple  perspectives  that involve  key  groups  including  providers,  patients,  and  their  families.  Relevant  variables  for  ICUs  509  SHORTELL ET AL.  MEDICAL CARE  include  clinical outcomes  of  care, efficiency  of  utilization,  technical  quality of  care pro-  vided,  the  ability  to  meet  family  member  needs,  and  staff  satisfaction.  An  optimal  performing unit would  be one that provides  superior patient  outcomes  at less  cost (than  competitors  or  peer  group  averages)  with  high levels of patient, family, and staff satis-  faction. Although  the greatest weight  might  be  placed  on  objective  measures  of  patient  outcomes  and cost of treatment or efficiency  of utilization, patient, family, and staff satis-  faction also are important. Patient and fam-  ily  member satisfaction  not  only  influences  the decision to seek care from the same pro-  viders  in  the  future but  also  influences  the  course  of  treatment  and  rehabilitation  for  the  present  condition.  Staff  satisfaction  is  important regarding retention, productivity,  and  continuity  of  care. High  staff  turnover  not only results in additional costs of recruit-  ment  and  training but,  also,  can be  disrup-  tive  of  patient  care and,  thereby,  compro-  mise  quality  and  continuity.  As  a  result  of  these considerations, the study model incor-  porates  all  five  dimensions  of  ICU perfor-  mance.  This  approach  also  recognizes  that  performance  measures  are  rarely  highly  correlated with  each  other  such  that  mea-  suring a single dimension  is likely to lead to  wrong or at least incomplete  conclusions  re-  garding unit performance.3  The  model  shown  in  Figure  1  suggests  that unit performance will be influenced  by  available technology,  the nature of the work  to be done  (i.e., task diversity), staffing, and  how well caregivers (physicians, nurses, and  related health  professionals)  work  together  (i.e.,  caregiver interaction).  This  model,  its  major  constructs  and  their  measurement  were prespecified before data collection and  analysis.18 The role of each of these is high-  lighted  below.  Technological Availability  Given  that the  most  severely  ill hospital-  ized  patients  are treated in  ICUs, the  avail-  510  ability  of  relevant  state-of-the-art  technol-  ogy  is particularly important. Technological  advances  have,  of  course,  played  a  major  role in the evolution  of intensive  care. These  technologies  range  from  pacemakers  and  ventilators  to  intra-aortic  balloon  pumps.  The  availability  of  such  technologies  in-  crease the ability to monitor patient care and  decrease  response  time  when  emergencies  occur (e.g., cardiac arrest). Although  there is  no  evidence  to  date  to  suggest  that  ICUs  with  more  technology  achieve  better  out-  comes  than  those  with  less,  there  is  some  evidence  from  the  organizational  literature  to  suggest  a  relationship  between  technol-  ogy and superior performance.19'20 Technol-  ogy is likely to be particularly strongly asso-  ciated  with  lower  risk-adjusted  mortality  since it is the rapid and appropriate applica-  tion  of  life-saving  technology  that  epito-  mizes  ICUs. Thus, the first hypothesis  to be  tested is:  HI:  The greater the extent to which  tech-  nology  is available in the unit, the better the  unit's  performance;  particularly  regarding  risk-adjusted mortality.  Task Diversity  Concerning  intensive  care, task diversity  refers to  the  number  of  different conditions  treated within  the unit. A greater variety of  patients  to  be  treated challenges  caregivers  because  their  expertise,  experience,  and  knowledge  must  be  applied  across a wider  range  of  conditions.  It  also  results  in  in-  creased  cost  of  communication,  coordina-  tion, and problem solving.  Existing research  suggests  that the ability to treat a high  vol-  ume  of  patients  with  a  limited  number  of  conditions  tends to be associated with better  outcomes.21-26 This may be due to the ability  of  caregivers  to  focus  their  skills,  knowl-  edge,  and  experience; to learn from experi-  ence; and to develop  various treatment pro-  tocols  and  practice guidelines  that result in  more  efficient  provision  and  monitoring  of  Vol. 32,  No.  5  PERFORMANCE OF  INTENSIVE CARE UNITS  TECHNOLOGICAL  AVAILABILITY  TASK DIVERSITY  (DIAGNOSTIC DIVERSITY)  ICU PERFORMANCE  NURSE STAFFING  *  RISK-ADJUSTED MORTALITY  * RISK-ADJUSTED LENGTH OF STAY  *  EVALUATED TECHNICAL QUALITY OF CARE  * EVALUATED ABILITY TO MEET FAMILY  MEMBER NEEDS  * NURSE TURNOVER  CAREGIVER  INTERACTION  *  CULTURE  *  LEADERSHIP  *  COMMUNICATION  * COORDINATION  *  PROBLEM-SOLVING/  CONFLICT MANAGEMENT  FIG. 1.

Thus,  the  second  hy-  pothesis  to be tested:  H2: The greater the  variety of  conditions  treated in the ICU, the poorer the unit's per-  formance;  particularly  regarding  risk-ad-  justed mortality.  Staffing  The availability of  a sufficient number of  competent  experienced  nurses  can  directly  influence  patient  outcomes  and  the  related  indicators of ICU performance.27'28 For exam-  ple,  units  with  less  than  a  1:2 nurse-to-pa-  tient ratio may be spread too thin to provide  direct care as  well  as  tasks associated  with  planning,  monitoring,  and  coordination  of  such  care.  In  general,  units  with  higher  staffing ratios are expected to achieve better  performance  than  those  with  lower  ratios.  Thus, the third hypothesis  to be tested:  H3: The higher the nurse to patient staff-  ing ratio, the better the unit's performance.  Caregiver Interaction  The  above  variables,  the  availability  of  technology,  the  variety  of  conditions  seen,  and the availability of relevant staff, are pri-  marily  "structural" factors  expected  to  be  associated with ICU performance. Of partic-  ular interest is the role that might be played  by  certain "process" factors involving  care-  giver interaction. We view  caregiver interac-  tion as a composite concept which, based on  existing  organizational  and  health  services  research,  includes  sub-dimensions  involv-  ing unit culture, leadership, communication,  coordination,  and  problem  solving/conflict  management.29-37  These  dimensions  consti-  511  SHORTELL ET AL.  MEDICAL CARE  tute  the  "physiology"  of  the  caregiver sys-  tem. Each is briefly highlighted  below.  Culture.  Culture  refers  to  the  norms,  values,  beliefs,  and  expectations  shared  by  people  working in a given  unit or organiza-  tion.29  For  example,  some  organizations  value  change,  innovation,  and  risk-taking  whereas others place greater emphasis on de-  pendability,  efficiency,  and  sticking  with  what  is  tried and  true. Some  organizations  place  a  high  emphasis  on  team  work  and  continuous  improvement  whereas  others  may  emphasize  competitive  behavior  or,  conversely,  place  a  high  value  on  having  people  get  along  and  "fit  in".  Although  there have  been  few  studies  of the relation-  ship between organizational culture and per-  formance,38 a supportive  culture emphasiz-  ing team work along with the establishment  of  high  standards is  likely  to  be  associated  with  better performance  than  cultures that  emphasize  competitiveness  or  are  overly  concerned  with  how  well  people  fit  in.29  This is likely to be particularly true in inten-  sive  care units  where  there  is  considerable  pressure for high performance in a work en-  vironment that requires considerable coordi-  nation  and  communication  across  a  wide  range of caregivers.  Leadership.  Leadership  refers  to  the  ability of individuals  to influence  others to-  ward the achievement  of relevant organiza-  tional goals  and  objectives.  Although  there  is an extensive  conceptual and empirical lit-  erature on  leadership,  relatively  little work  has been done in health care.39 Nonetheless,  leadership that sets high standards, clarifies  expectations,  encourages  initiative  and  in-  put,  and  provides  necessary  support  re-  sources should be associated with higher per-  formance.  Communication.  There  are  many  aspects  of  communication  that  are  impor-  tant  including  openness  (i.e.,  being  candid  and  honest),  accuracy,  timeliness,  and  un-  derstanding.31 Given the complexity of con-  ditions  being  treated,  the  relatively  short  512  time period the patients are in intensive  care  units,  and  the  number  of  different  people  involved  with  the patient's care, ICUs have  great  need  for  effective  communication  among  providers. The information needs  to  be timely, accurate, and relevant. Thus, it is  expected  that  communication  will  be  posi-  tively  associated  with  better  unit  perfor-  mance.  Coordination.  Coordination  refers  to  the  extent  to which  functions  and activities  both  within  the unit and between  units  are  brought  together  in  a  way  that  promotes  cost-effective  continuous  care.36 Given  the  high  degree  of  interdependence  that  ICUs  have with other units such as the emergency  room, operating room, step-down  units, and  patient floors in addition to laboratory, radi-  ology,  pharmacy,  and  respiratory therapy,  the need for effective coordination is particu-  larly acute.  Thus,  we  expect  that coordina-  tion will be positively  associated with better  unit performance.  Problem  Solving/Conflict  Manage-  ment.  As  patient  care becomes  more  com-  plex and inter-dependent,  it is important for  care givers to find ways  of addressing prob-  lems  and  resolving  conflicts.  In  ICUs  the  usual  disagreements  over  treatment  ap-  proaches and philosophies,  roles and respon-  sibilities, and differential access to resources  are exacerbated  by  ethical  issues  involving  death  and  dying  and  often  disagreements  among  family  members  regarding  wishes  for their child, spouse, parent, or relative. As  a result, ICUs need  effective  problem  solv-  ing  and  conflict  resolution  mechanisms  to  expedite cost-effective  care.35 We expect that  more effective  problem solving  and conflict  management  approaches  will  be  associated  with  better unit performance.  Culture, leadership, communication, coor-  dination, and problem solving/conflict  man-  agement  are viewed  as interrelated compo-  nents  or dimensions  of caregiver interaction.  Although  one  can  examine  their individual  effects,  we  believe  they  are best  considered  Vol. 32, No.  5  PERFORMANCE OF INTENSIVE CARE UNITS  as a composite  construct because  it is diffi-  cult to distinguish  them as one observes  the  work  that  occurs  in  ICUs.  For example,  a  nurse  and  physician  discussing  whether  or  not  a  patient  can  be  discharged  to  a  step-  down  unit involves  all of the above  dimen-  sions,  communication,  coordination,  and  problem solving being obvious,  but, the dis-  cussion also takes place within the context of  a given leadership style and unit culture. We  expect that caregiver interaction will be par-  ticularly  strongly  associated  with  greater  unit efficiency of utilization, evaluated tech-  nical quality of care, and evaluated ability to  meet family member needs. Thus, the fourth  hypothesis  to be tested:  H4:  The  greater the  quality  of  caregiver  interaction among  physicians  and nurses in  the  unit,  the  better the  unit's  performance;  particularly regarding  efficiency  of  utiliza-  tion, evaluated quality of care and evaluated  ability to meet  family member needs.  Methods  Sample  The  population  comprised  1,691  nonfe-  deral U.S. hospitals  with  200  beds or more.  This group represents the vast majority of all  hospitals  with  intensive  care units.  Within  this group, a stratified random sample of 26  hospitals  was  selected  based  on  bed  size,  geographic region, and teaching status, with  the  latter defined  as  offering  one  or  more  accredited  graduate  training programs.  An  additional  14 volunteer  university-affiliated  or  tertiary  care  teaching  hospitals  partici-  pated  bringing  the  total  number  of  study  hospitals to 40. Data were collected from the  medical-surgical ICUs in each hospital using  those units with the highest admission rates.  For  two  volunteer  institutions,  data  were  collected  from  two  medical  surgical  ICUs  bringing the total count to 42 ICUs available  for analysis. Because the 14 volunteer hospi-  tals did not differ significantly on any of the  study  analytic variables from the randomly  selected  hospitals,  the  two  groups  were  pooled  for analysis.  For hospitals  above  200  beds,  compari-  sons of the ICUs involved  in this study with  those  nationwide  indicates  that  88% of  the  study's  hospitals  were  not-for-profit  com-  pared to 77% nationally.  Fifty-three percent  were  affiliated with  a medical  school,  con-  sistent  with  the  national  rate of  53%.  The  average number of beds in participating hos-  pitals  was  358  compared  with  the  national  average of 372. The study ICUs had an aver-  age bed size of  13, smaller than the national  average of 24. Study hospitals have an aver-  age  occupancy  rate of  71.1%  compared  to  the national rate of 70.6%. The participating  ICUs  had  an  average  occupancy  rate  of  77%. Thirty of  the  ICUs were  mixed medi-  cal-surgical (71%), eight  were  surgical only  (19%), and  four  were  medical  only  (10%).  These  data suggest  that the study  sample  is  largely representative of the national popula-  tion  above  200  beds  although  the  specific  ICUs studied  are somewhat  smaller in bed-  size than the national average.  Patient Selection  Data  were  collected  on  17,440  patients  representing an average of 415  patients per  unit (range 299-499).  For 80% of  the units,  data  were  collected  on  consecutive  admis-  sions.  When  patient  volume  precluded  this  from occurring, either every second  or third  patient  was  systematically  selected.  Exclu-  sions  included  patients  admitted  with  sus-  pected  acute  myocardial  infarction,  coro-  nary  artery  bypass  surgery,  burn  injury,  those  younger  than  16  years  of  age,  and  those  remaining  in  the  ICU for less  than  4  hours.  Data  collection  began  in  May  1988  and  was  concluded  in  February 1990.  The  study  period  at  each  ICU  averaged  10  months  with  a range from 3 to  17 months.  Measuring ICU Performance  Risk-Adjusted  Mortality  Rate.  Each  unit's expected  patient mortality was  calcu-  513  SHORTELL ET AL.  MEDICAL  CARE  lated  based  on  adjustments  for a variety of  patient demographic,  physiological,  and re-  lated  characteristics using  the  APACHE  III  methodology.l7'18  The  predictor  variables  included  the  APACHE  III score,  primary  disease  category,  duration  of  hospitaliza-  tion, location prior to ICU admission  (emer-  gency  room,  recovery  room,  hospital,  or  operating room, ICU readmission or transfer  from another ICU or hospital), and whether  surgery was  elective  or emergency  (defined  as operation for an immediate life-threaten-  ing  condition).  The  APACHE  III score  was  computed  during  the  first  ICU  day  using  each  patient's  clinical  record.  The  Acute  Physiologic  Score  (APS)  was  derived  by  providing  weights  to  17  potential  physio-  logic variables, weights  applied to seven  co-  immune  morbid  conditions  that  reduce  function,  and weights  assigned  to increased  chronologic age all applied within  78 mutu-  ally exclusive  diagnostic categories (Appen-  dix A).40 Patient data were  entered into on-  site  microcomputers  using  specially  de-  signed  software.  To  assure  quality,  data  collected  on  the  first 20  patients  were  re-  viewed  at each hospital. An adjustment was  also  made  to  take into  account  triage pres-  sures  on  the  unit  by  computing  the  survi-  vors' hospital length of stay compared to the  average length of stay for all 42 units control-  ling  for disease  and  the  APACHE III score.  An increasing APACHE III score is related to  an  increased  risk of  hospital  mortality  and  accounts  for 90% of  the  area under  the  re-  ceiver operating curve (ROC).40  The above  information  was  used  in  a lo-  gistic regression to compute  each  unit's  ex-  pected mortality rate.17 A standardized mor-  tality ratio (SMR) was then computed  by di-  viding  each  unit's  actual  mortality  by  its  predicted mortality. Thus, an SMR of 1 indi-  cates  that  the  actual  and  predicted  death  rates  match  exactly,  whereas  an  SMR less  than  1 indicates that the actual death rate is  less than predicted and an SMR more than 1  indicates that the actual death rate is above  514  that predicted. The study-wide  mean  actual  mortality  rate  was  16.6%  (range  6.2%-  40%). The SMR range was from 0.67 to 1.26.  The  SMR was  significantly  better  (P  <.05)  for  five  ICUs  and  significantly  worse  (P  <.05)  for  five  other  ICUs.  Data  were  also  collected  on  survival  30  days  post-hospital  discharge for Medicare patients and by tele-  phone  for a 15% random sample of all other  patients. These data resulted in no change in  the  relative  rank  ordering  of  unit  perfor-  mance  and,  thus,  are not  examined  further  here.  Risk-Adjusted  Length  of  Stay.  To  measure  the  efficiency  of  utilization  within  the unit, a prediction equation similar to that  described  above  for  mortality  was  devel-  oped  to  determine  an  expected  length  of  ICU stay.  This included  a  correction factor  using  the  method  of  cubic  splines  to  take  into  account  the  fact  that  sicker  patients  tended  to die  in the  first day,  resulting in  a  low  length  of stay.17 For each unit the ratio  of  the actual length  of  stay to the predicted  length  of  stay  was  then  calculated.  The  mean actual ICU average length  of stay was  4.7  days  (range 3.3-7.3  days).  The  ratio of  actual  to  predicted  length  of  stay  ranged  from .89 to 1.24.  For six ICUs, the ratio was  significantly lower or better (P <.05)  and for  five other units significantly higher or worse  (P _.05).  The availability and use  of a step-  down  or intermediate care unit was  not sig-  nificantly correlated with  either average ac-  tual ICU length  of  stay or the risk-adjusted  ratio  of  actual  to  expected  ICU  length  of  stay.  Evaluated  Technical  Quality  of  Care.  At the same time patient care data were be-  ing  collected,  an  organizational  assessment  questionnaire  was  used  to collect data from  all nurses  on  all shifts,  physicians  and resi-  dents  who  provided  the  majority of  care in  the unit (including attending staff who  were  the heaviest admitters to the unit), and ward  clerks/secretaries.41 A  total  of  1,418  ques-  tionnaires  were  completed  by  nurses  (78%  Vol. 32, No. 5  PERFORMANCE OF INTENSIVE CARE UNITS  Evaluated  Ability  return), 790  by  eligible physicians  (65% re-  turn),  and  111  by  ward  clerks/secretaries  (65% return). A  five  item  Likert scale  (1  =  strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree) of per-  ceived absolute technical quality of care pro-  vided  in  the  unit  (Cronbach's alpha  =  .76)  was  used.  Relevant  items  included  the  ex-  tent  to  which  patient  care  treatment  goals  were  met;  the  extent  to  which  good  out-  comes were achieved taking into account pa-  tient  severity; the  ability to  apply  the  most  recently available technologies; the ability to  function  well  together  as  a  team;  and  the  ability to respond  to emergency  situations.  to  Meet  Family  Members  Needs.  Due  to  limitations  of  time, resources, and the nature of intensive  care,  it  was  not  possible  to  obtain  direct  measures  of  patient  satisfaction.  Neither  was  it possible  to obtain direct measures  of  family member satisfaction. It was  possible,  however,  to obtain providers' evaluation  of  how  well  they  felt  family  member  needs  were met. This was measured by a two item,  five point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree,  5  =  strongly agree; Cronbach's alpha  =  .75)  comprising  items  related  to  the  extent  to  which  the  unit  did  a  good  job  in  meeting  family  member  needs  in  an  absolute  sense  and,  secondly,  whether  relative  to  other  ICUs in the  area, the unit did a good  job of  meeting  family member needs.  Nurse  Turnover.  Nurse  turnover  was  used  as one  measure of  staff satisfaction.  It  was  calculated from data provided  by  each  unit by  dividing  the number of nurses  who  left each ICU in the year of the study by the  number employed  that year.  Measuring Task Diversity  Task diversity or diagnostic  diversity was  measured using the 78 major disease catego-  ries in the APACHE III Prognostic System.40  These  disease  categories  provided  66  pri-  mary  reasons  for  ICU  admission  covering  15,269  (87.5%) of  the  17,440  patients.  The  remaining  2,171  admissions  were  grouped  into  seven  nonoperative  and  five  operative  organ  system  (e.g.,  cardiovascular, respira-  tory, etc.) categories. Attempts to weight  the  measure by  the  percentage  of  patients  seen  in each category did not change  overall unit  ranking.  As  a result,  a simple  count  of  the  number  of  different disease  categories seen  by  each  unit was  used  as the measure.  The  average number of different diagnostic con-  ditions treated was  60 with  a range from 44  to  71. As expected,  greater diversity existed  in  the  mixed  medical-surgical  units  (x  =  62.5)  than  the  units  focusing  on  surgical  conditions  only (x =  56.5) or medical condi-  tions  only  (x =  47.8).  Measuring Technological Availability  Technological  availability  was  measured  by how  many of 39 items recommended  by  the  Joint  Commission  on  Accreditation  of  Healthcare  Organizations,42 a  NIH  Critical  Care Medicine  Consensus  Panel,43 and The  Society  for  Critical  Care  Medicine44 were  available  in  the  unit  (Appendix  B).  These  data  were  provided  by  the  Background/  Structure  Questionnaire  and  validated  by  on-site  visits  to  nine  ICUs.  Units  averaged  80% of the recommended items with a range  from 59% to 97%.  Measuring Nurse Staffing  Data were obtained on the staffing of each  unit  on  each  shift  during  the  study  period  from  the  Background/Structure  question-  naire  completed  by  the  nursing  director of  each  unit.  The overall  average nurse to pa-  tient  ratio was  .66  (slightly  more  than  one  nurse  for every  two  patients)  with  a range  from .31 to  1.31.  Measuring Caregiver Interaction  The  discrete  dimensions  of  caregiver in-  teraction,  culture,  leadership,  communica-  tion,  coordination,  and  problem  solving/  conflict management,  were  measured  using  515  SHORTELL ET AL.  MEDICAL CARE  five item Likert scales (1 = strongly disagree,  5 = strongly agree) that were part of the ear-  lier noted  organizational assessment  instru-  ment  completed  by  unit  members.41 These  scales,  described below,  were  initially  pilot  tested  in  five medical-surgical  ICUs in four  Chicago  area hospitals  involving  responses  from 134 nurses and 53 physicians. Analysis  of the pilot data resulted in developing  sepa-  for  physicians  and  rate  questionnaires  nurses; developing  separate questions to as-  sess within  group (e.g., within  nursing) and  between  group  (e.g.,  between  nurses  and  physicians) interaction; and revision of some  items  (e.g.,  between  unit  coordination)  to  improve reliability.  Culture.  Unit culture was  measured  by  48  items  selected  from  the  Organizational  Culture Inventory  (OCI)30 Of  the  available  measures  of  culture,  the  OCI  is  the  most  widely tested regarding reliability and valid-  ity and has demonstrated stable factor solu-  tions across samples.29 The items yield three  factors: 1) a team satisfaction-oriented scale:  2) a people  security-oriented  scale; and 3) a  task  security-oriented  scale.  As  previously  noted, it was hypothesized  that a team satis-  faction-oriented  culture  that  emphasizes  self-expression,  achievement,  cooperation,  and staff development  is mostly  likely to be  associated  with  better unit performance.  In  contrast, a people  security-oriented  culture  emphasizes  approval,  adherence  to  proce-  dures,  dependence,  and  avoidance  of  con-  flict.  A  task-oriented  culture  emphasizes  perfectionism,  competition,  opposition,  and  authoritarian  control.  The  rotated  factor  loadings  for  the  team  satisfaction-oriented  scale  (principal components  analysis,  vari-  max rotation) ranged from .47 to .78 with an  Eigenvalue  of  13.02.41 Convergent  and dis-  criminant validity was  assessed  by correlat-  ing the team satisfaction factor with nursing  and physician  leadership,  effective  commu-  nication  and  coordination,  open  collabora-  tive  problem  solving  and  conflict  manage-  ment,  and  team cohesion.  All of  these  rela-  516  tionships  were  statically  significant  in  the  predicted  direction.41 Cronbach's  alpha  for  the  team-satisfaction  culture  dimension  used  in the analysis  was  .94.  Leadership.  Both nursing and physician  leadership were separately measured by two  eight  item  scales  involving  the  extent  to  which  unit  leaders  emphasize  standards  of  excellence  to  the  staff,  communicated  clear  goals and expectations, responded  to chang-  ing needs  and situations,  and were in touch  with  unit  members'  perceptions  and  con-  cerns.41 Cronbach's  alpha  for  the  nursing  leadership  scale  was  .87  and  for the physi-  cian leadership scale .88. From a convergent  and discriminate validity  perspective,  nurs-  ing and physician leadership were positively  associated with  a team satisfaction-oriented  culture  and  open-collaborative  problem-  solving  approaches  and  negatively  corre-  lated  with  people  security-  and  task  secu-  rity-oriented  culture  and  problem  solving  methods related to avoidance and forcing is-  sues.41 Given  that many  units  did not have  full-time medical directors, the nursing lead-  ership scale was used. This scale represents a  more comprehensive measure of ICU leader-  ship  by  recognizing  the  pervasiveness  of  nursing care across all hours and shifts.  Communication.  Communication  was  measured along a number of dimensions  in-  cluding  openness,  accuracy, timeliness,  un-  derstanding, and satisfaction.  Because these  dimensions  were  highly  intercorrelated,  timeliness  of  communication  was  selected  because  of  the  importance  assigned  to  re-  ceiving  information  in  a  timely  fashion  to  monitor patient care and to coordinate care  between  and  among  units.  Timeliness  of  communication  was  measured  by  three  items involving  the degree to which  patient  care  information  was  relayed  promptly  to  the  people  who  needed  to  be  informed.41  Cronbach's alpha for the timeless of commu-  nication scale was  .64.  Coordination.  Coordination  between  units was  measured by a four item scale re-  Vol. 32,  No.  5  PERFORMANCE OF  INTENSIVE CARE UNITS  lating  to  the  ICU's ability  to  coordinate  its  work with  other units such as the operating  room,  emergency  room,  step-down  units  and  patient  floors.41  This  measure  was  highly correlated with a separate measure of  coordination within the ICU. Cronbach's al-  pha was  .75 for the between  unit coordina-  tion measure.  Problem  Solving/Conflict  Manage-  ment.  A four-item scale of open-collabora-  tive problem-solving suggested in the organi-  zational literature was used.33-35 These items  involved  the extent to which  physicians  and  nurses  work  actively  to  make  sure  that  all  available  expertise  is  brought  to  bear  on  a  problem with the goal of arriving at the best  possible  solution.41 Cronbach's  alpha  was  .82.  Analysis of variance was conducted to de-  termine  whether  between  unit  differences  were  greater  than  within  unit  differences  and  the  degree  of  internal  agreement  was  assessed  using  intra-class correlation coeffi-  cients.41 This  analysis  indicated  significant  between  unit  differences  (P  <  .001)  and  within  group agreement  (median  eta of  .08  for total sample,  .12 for nurses,  .11 for phy-  sicians) making aggregation to the unit level  appropriate.41 The  summary  measure  re-  flecting caregiver interaction was  computed  by  aggregating  and  averaging  the  sub-di-  mension  scores with each dimension  receiv-  ing  equal weight.  Cronbach's alpha  for the  composite  index  was  .89.  The overall  aver-  age caregiver interaction score was 3.59 with  a range from 3.26  to 4.07.  Results  The  means,  standard  deviations,  ranges,  and zero order correlations for the study vari-  ables  are  shown  in  Table  1.  The  perfor-  mance  measures  are  not  highly  correlated  with each other, confirming the utility of us-  ing a multiple indicator approach. Ordinary  least squares regression was used  to test the  hypotheses,  and the results for each perfor-  mance  measure are shown  in Table 2.  Risk-Adjusted Mortality Rate  As shown  in Table 2, technological  avail-  ability  and  diagnostic  diversity  are  asso-  ciated with risk-adjusted mortality in the ex-  pected  directions.  Specifically,  the  greater  the technological  availability of the unit, the  lower its risk-adjusted mortality rate. At the  same time, the greater the number of differ-  ent  conditions  that  are  treated  in  the  unit  (i.e.,  diagnostic  diversity),  the  higher  the  unit's  risk-adjusted  mortality.  Contrary  to  prediction,  nurse  staffing  was  not  signifi-  cantly associated with  risk-adjusted mortal-  ity  perhaps  due  to  the  relatively  low  vari-  ance  in  staffing  ratios  among  the  study  units.  There  was  no  relationship  between  caregiver interaction and risk-adjusted mor-  tality  suggesting  that  mortality  is  more  in-  fluenced  by  technological  factors  while,  as  will  be  subsequently  discussed,  the  effi-  ciency  of  delivering  care is more influenced  by human  interaction factors.  Given  the  significant  relationship  be-  tween  technology  and  lower  risk-adjusted  mortality,  we  examined  the  factors  that  might be associated with greater availability  of  technology.  We  hypothesized  that  units  with  a full-time  medical director, located in  hospitals  with  greater  resources,  having  teaching activity, with ICU leaders more ac-  tively involved  in quality assurance and im-  provement  activities,  and  those  existing  in  hospitals  facing  a greater degree  of  market  competition  (based  on  the  number of  other  hospitals with which the participating hospi-  tal competes  for either patients,  physicians,  nurses  or other health  professionals)  might  have  more  technology.  The  results,  shown  in  Table  3,  indicate  significant  associations  in  the  expected  direction  for  resources  (as  measured by a 3-year average of hospital net  operating income  as a percentage of operat-  ing revenue in the years immediately preced-  517  SHORTELL ET AL.

Risk-Adjusted of Length Stay  As  predicted,  caregiver interaction is sig-  nificantly  associated  with  lower  risk-ad-  justed length  of stay. This suggests  that fac-  tors involving culture, leadership, communi-  cation,  coordination,  and  the  ability  to  manage  conflict  are,  indeed,  important  for  efficiently managing  ICU care. Technologi-  cal availability, nurse staffing, and diagnos-  tic diversity  have  no  significant  association  with  risk-adjusted length  of stay.  Nurse Turnover  As predicted, caregiver interaction is nega-  tively  associated  with  nurse  turnover. That  is,  the higher  the  quality of  caregiver inter-  action,  the  lower  the  nurse  turnover in  the  unit.  Technological  availability,  the  nurse  staffing  ratio,  and  diagnostic  diversity  are  unrelated to nurse turnover.  Evaluated Technical Quality of Care  As shown  in Table 2, caregiver interaction  is strongly associated with evaluated techni-  cal quality of care provided  in the unit.  Be-  cause both  of  these  are perceived  measures  coming from questionnaire data, the finding  is  subject to  mono-method  variance bias.45  To  correct  for  this,  split  sample  analyses  were  conducted  whereby  half  of  the  sam-  ple's score on caregiver interaction was used  to predict the other half of the sample's score  on  evaluated  technical  quality  of  care. Es-  sentially  the  same  results  were  obtained  (beta = .58; P <.001)  indicating that the rela-  tionship is less likely to be an artifact of data  collection.  Technological  availability,  diag-  nostic diversity,  and the nurse staffing ratio  are not  significantly  associated  with  evalu-  ated technical quality of care.  Evaluated Ability to Meet Family Needs  associated  with  As  predicted,  caregiver  interaction  was  also  positively  staff  members'  evaluated  ability  to  meet  family  member  needs.  In  addition,  technological  availability was inversely associated with the  ability  to  meet  family  member  needs.  Nei-  ther  the  nurse  staffing  ratio nor  diagnostic  diversity  were  significantly  associated  with  the evaluated ability to meet family member  needs.  As  above,  split sample  analysis  was  conducted  for the caregiver interaction vari-  519  SHORTELL ET AL.  MEDICAL CARE  able  yielding  results  similar  to  those  pre-  sented  in Table 2 (beta =  .38; P <.05).  Discussion  and  Implications  The study findings have important mana-  gerial and policy implications. The availabil-  ity  of  more  technology  in  intensive  care  units was significantly associated with lower  risk-adjusted  mortality.  This  provides  pre-  liminary support for the hypothesis  that in-  vestment  in technology  and services is asso-  ciated  with  improved  outcomes.  This  find-  ing  is  contrary  to  some  recent  studies  emphasizing  the lack of evidence  that tech-  nology,  e.g.,  pulmonary  artery  catheters,  improves  patient  outcome.46-48 The  result,  however,  is consistent with a recent study of  mortality among Medicare patients in which  those  patients  with  a greater level  of  access  to  high  technology  equipment  had  lower  risk-adjusted mortality.49 The  result  is  also  supported  by  previously  documented  but  often  forgotten  improvements  in  outcome  from conditions such as drug overdose  with  the application of intensive  care50 51 and the  introduction of specific life support technolo-  gies such as ventilators,52'53 pacemakers,54'55  and  hemodialysis.5658  The  existence  of  greater technology  may also reflect a greater  priority placed on monitoring and treatment  of the critically ill.  The findings pertaining to the positive  as-  sociation  of  technology  with  hospital  oper-  ating  income,  teaching  activity,  and  ICU  leader  involvement  in  quality  assurance/  quality improvement also are interesting. To  the extent that health care reform initiatives  maintain  some  degree  of  market  competi-  tion, it appears that hospitals  that are finan-  cially  better  off  will  be  able  to  secure  the  necessary  technology  to  achieve  better pa-  tient  outcomes  than  those  less  well  off.  These  variables,  financial  resources,  teach-  ing activity, and quality improvement initia-  tives, could also be included  among  a larger  set  of  criteria for making  technology  diffu-  sion  decisions.  The  negative  relationship  between  diag-  nostic  diversity  and  risk-adjusted mortality  is  relevant  because  it  supports  a  growing  body  of literature suggesting  that the appli-  cation of specialized skills to a more concen-  trated volume  of patients is associated  with  better patient  outcomes.21-26 Although  this  finding should  not be interpreted as directly  supporting  the  development  of  specialty  ICUs,  it  does  suggest  that  focusing  on  a  narrower range of conditions might be asso-  ciated  with  better outcomes.  Focusing  on  a  narrower range of conditions permits nurses  and physicians to more easily apply their ex-  pertise and experience, makes it easier to co-  ordinate  activities  and  communicate  rele-  vant  information,  and  deal  with  problems  and conflict situations.  In this regard, Table  1  contains  an  interesting  negative  correla-  tion  (-.34,  P  <.01)  between  diagnostic  di-  versity and  the  nurse/patient  staffing ratio.  To some extent, the diversity encountered in  an ICU is the result of uncontrollable factors  such as the geographic area in which the hos-  pital is  located.  For example,  an  ICU in  an  inner-city hospital may have  a high number  of substance abuse cases. ICUs in communi-  ties  with  a  high  percentage  of  elderly  pa-  tients  may  treat a  much  more  diverse  case  mix  reflecting  the  greater  number  of  ill-  nesses  associated  with  aging.  Creation  of  more specialized  or homogenous  groupings  of  patients,  of  course,  carries  important  staffing,  cost,  and  access  implications  for  caregivers,  hospital  executives,  third-party  payers, and policy makers. The issue  merits  further study using an even larger sample of  ICUs  drawn  from  both  teaching  and  non-  teaching hospitals.  Taken together, the findings pertaining to  the availability of technology  and diagnostic  diversity are important to external organiza-  tions  such  as  the  Joint Commission  on  Ac-  creditation  of  Healthcare  Organizations  (JCAHO), the Professional Review Organiza-  520  Vol. 32, No. 5  PERFORMANCE OF  INTENSIVE CARE UNITS  tions  (PROs), other third-party payers such  as  the  Health  Care Finance Administration  (HCFA), and relevant professional  societies  such  as  the  Society  for Critical Care Medi-  cine  (SCCM).  Organizations,  such  as  the  JCAHO and SCCM for example,  might fur-  ther refine their standards related to the tech-  nological  requirements  of  institutions  to  provide  care relative  to  the  severity  of  pa-  tients  treated in ICUs. Attention  might  also  be  given  to  the  homogeneity  of  patient  groups  relative  to the  skill mix of  the  care-  givers.  HCFA  and  other  payers  might  use  such information for purposes of reimburse-  ment  and for ongoing  monitoring of the re-  lationship  between  such  structural factors  and patient outcomes.  In this regard, greater  attention  should  be  given  to moving  all in-  stitutions toward the high  performer end of  the distribution rather than merely focusing  on  the  poor  performer tail of  the  distribu-  tion.  We also examined whether  or not techno-  logical  availability  was  more  important the  greater the degree of diagnostic diversity in a  unit. This was  tested by the statistical inter-  action  term  technological  availability  X  diagnostic  diversity  but  was  found  to  be  nonsignificant.  Of  particular interest  is  the  fact  that  the  caregiver interaction scale was positively  as-  sociated with four out of the five unit perfor-  mance  measures,  risk-adjusted  length  of  stay,  evaluated  technical  quality  of  care,  evaluated  ability  to  meet  family  member  needs,  and  nurse  turnover. The association  of  caregiver  interaction  with  risk-adjusted  length  of  stay  is  particularly  significant  given the growing demand for ICU care and  the  consequent  triage pressures  generated.  The findings  suggest  that ICUs that have  a  team-oriented culture with supportive nurs-  ing  leadership,  timely  communication,  ef-  fective  coordination,  and with  collaborative  open problem solving approaches are signifi-  cantly more efficient in terms of moving  pa-  tients in and out of the unit. These units also  have  lower nurse turnover that can result in  further  cost  savings  through  reduced  ex-  penses  for recruitment and training.  The  positive  relationship  between  care-  giver  interaction  and  evaluated  technical  quality of care suggests  that physicians  and  that  technical  quality  is  nurses  believe  higher  when  a  team-oriented  culture  and  supportive  leadership  exists  along  with  ef-  fective  communication,  coordination,  and  problem-solving  approaches.  This  is  true  even though there was no significant associa-  tion with risk-adjusted mortality per se. The  positive  association  with  the ability to meet  family  member  needs  recognizes  that  high  quality comprehensive  ICU care also has an  important  service  dimension  involving  the  ability to listen to family members and pro-  vide  compassionate  support.  These  results  are particularly important because  the care-  giver  interaction  variables,  culture,  leader-  ship,  communication,  coordination,  and  problem  solving/conflict  management,  are  under  the  influence  and  control  of  physi-  cians, nurses, and executives associated with  the  unit.59 Thus,  they  represent  levers  for  corrective action and continuous  quality im-  provement.60-62  Finally, it is of interest to note that techno-  logical  availability  is  negatively  associated  with  the  ability  to  meet  family  member  needs.  It appears that units with more tech-  nology  are able to do a better job regarding  risk-adjusted  patient  mortality  but  do  less  well  in focusing  on family member needs.  It  may be that units with more technology  pay  greater attention to the technological aspects  of  medicine  that takes away  from devoting  attention  to  the  interpersonal  aspects  of  meeting  family  member  needs.63  In  any  event,  the  findings  indicate  the  difficulty  that high technology  medical care has in bal-  ancing  the  growing  technological  demands  of patient care with  the need  to be more re-  sponsive  to  patients'  and  family  members'  concerns and anxieties.  We also  explored  two  additional  interac-  521  SHORTELL ET AL.  MEDICAL CARE  tion possibilities: namely  the possibility that  where  technological  availability was  lower,  caregiver interaction might  be  more impor-  tant; and, secondly,  where  diagnostic diver-  sity was greater, caregiver interaction might  be  more  important.  Neither  of  the  interac-  tion terms, however,  were significant.  Taken as a whole,  the results suggest par-  tial support for all study  hypotheses.  A key  result, however,  is that different factors ap-  pear to be  associated  with  different aspects  of performance. Clearly, technological avail-  ability and diagnostic diversity are the stron-  gest correlates of risk-adjusted mortality. In  contrast,  managerial  process  variables  re-  lated to the quality of caregiver interaction is  the  strongest  correlate  of  unit  efficiency,  evaluated technical quality of care, the abil-  ity to meet family member needs,  and nurs-  ing turnover.  ICUs now  have  the  capability to risk ad-  just their outcomes  for purposes  of internal  and external comparison.40 This information  can be used to meet the external accountabil-  ity requirements of regulators and payers of  care  and,  perhaps,  more  importantly,  to  meet the desires for continuous internal qual-  this  study  ity  improvement.60-62,64  Although  was  limited  to  42  intensive  care units  and  was unable to address issues of possible sea-  sonality in the conditions treated, it nonethe-  less represents the largest study of ICUs un-  dertaken to date. Using refined adjustments  for  differences  in  patient  characteristics,  physiology,  and  severity,  taking  into  ac-  count differences in technology,  and using a  multiple indicator approach to performance,  the  study  establishes  important  relation-  ships  between  caregiver management  pro-  cesses and outcomes of care. Further verifica-  tion  and  extension  of  these  findings  will  provide a basis for ICUs to monitor their per-  formance similar to the way  in which  indi-  vidual  patients  are  now  monitored.  When  such monitoring detects less than optimal or  desired performance,  examining  both  tech-  nological  and  organizational/managerial  522  practices associated with the effectiveness  of  caregiver interaction will  provide  clinicians  with  a  starting  point  for  corrective  action  and ongoing  improvement.
