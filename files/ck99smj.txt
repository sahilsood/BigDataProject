Interfirm cooperation and its performance implications are examined in the context of two  widely cited theoretical approaches to organizations. Broadly speaking, the resource-based view  suggests that firms seek to capitalize on and increase their capabilities and endowments,  whereas organizational economics asserts that firms focus on minimizing the costs of organizing.  Although these perspectives agree on managers' likely actions in many areas, their predictions  diverge when interfirm cooperation is considered. We take a step toward reconciling these  differences by positing that firms place resource-based concerns in front of considerations from  organizational economics when deciding whether or not to engage in interfirm cooperation.  We examined this prediction using data from 94 publicly held restaurant chains. The results  support our integrated view, but also suggest that giving primacy to resource concerns detracts  from the performance of some firms. We derive several implications of these findings in an  effort to guide subsequent inquiry. Copyright ? 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  The capacity to bring multiple and often com-  peting perspectives to bear on important organi-  zational phenomena is one of the appealing qual-  ities of strategic management research. Indeed,  some consider strategic management's status as  a pluralistic arena for examining complex prob-  lems to be its distinctive competence (Meyer,  1991). By encouraging scholars to look beyond  singular views, the application and juxtaposition  of multiple theoretical approaches can furnish  rich descriptions of organizational actions, their  antecedents, and their consequences (e.g., Allison,  1971; Gray and Wood, 1991).  The resource-based view (RBV) and organi-  zational economics (OE) are two perspectives  on organizations that have gained considerable  currency in recent years (e.g., Conner and Pra-  halad, 1996; Dyer, 1996; Markides and William-  Key words: resource-based view, organizational eco-  nomics, interfirm cooperation, performance  * Correspondence: David J.

The for-  mer argues, in essence, that top managers choose  actions that best capitalize on a firm's unique  endowments of resources and capabilities. In con-  trast, the latter posits that managers' central con-  cern is organizing activities efficiently. Given  their different emphases, the RBV and OE are  generally treated as independent approaches that  each focus on a distinctive set of research ques-  tions. In some research contexts, however, both  have been applied to explain the same phenom-  enon. When the perspectives diverge, there is  little extant information from which to resolve  the contradictory explanations offered.  The purpose of this paper is to examine an  important strategic decision-whether to manage  new operations as wholly-owned entities or  through interfirm cooperation-where predictions  from the RBV and OE differ and to take a step  toward reconciling these differences. Interfirm  cooperation exists when two or more otherwise  sovereign organizations act in concert to pursue  mutual gain (Borys and Jemison, 1989).

Combs and D. J. Ketchen, Jr.  the RBV, interfirm cooperation permits firms to  share resources and thereby overcome resource-  based constraints to growth (e.g., Hamel, 1991).  According to OE, cooperation is advisable only  if it minimizes the cost of governing (i.e., moni-  toring and controlling) organizational activities  (Hesterly, Liebeskind, and Zenger, 1990). For  many firms, both views suggest the same course  of action. As detailed in this paper, however,  some resource-poor firms confront a dilemma in  that the RBV points them toward cooperation  whereas OE discourages cooperation. The reso-  lution, we argue below, is that firms in need  of certain resources will have to use interfirm  cooperation even when cooperation is not prudent  from an OE perspective. The effects of interfirm  cooperation on organizational performance under  different RBV and OE contingencies are also  examined. Whereas the RBV places resources at  the center of competitive advantage and therefore  performance (Wererfelt, 1984), OE suggests that  strong performance depends on matching strategic  decisions (e.g., whether or not to enact interfirm  cooperation) to exchange conditions (Williamson,  1994). Through investigating the performance  implications of interfirm cooperation under vari-  ous RBV and OE considerations, we work toward  integration of the two perspectives' disparate  insights on the determinants of performance.  resources and capabilities. Considerable research  attention has been devoted to describing how  resources might affect organizational action (e.g.,  Argyres, 1996; Bergh, 1995; Mahoney and Pan-  dian, 1992) and to defining the specific processes  through which resources affect performance (e.g.,  Barney, 1991; Peteraf, 1993; Wernerfelt, 1984).  Resources can influence a variety of the actions  taken by top management. Because firms'  decisions about how to manage new operations  (interfirm cooperation vs. full ownership) is our  focus, we limit our discussion to resources'  influence on growth. First, resources can influence  the direction of growth. Firms can more  efficiently expand into activities that draw upon  existing resources than into activities with no  relation to current resources (Barney, 1988; Chat-  terjee and Wernerfelt, 1991). The notion that  resources guide the direction of growth is  reflected in multinational firms that expand first  into markets that are culturally similar (Barkema,  Bell, and Pennings, 1996), diversified firms that  expand into resource-related businesses (Robins  and Wiersema, 1995), and in manufacturers that  vertically integrate to make inputs where their  capabilities facilitate lower production costs  (Argyres, 1996).  Resources can also influence the rate of growth.  As Penrose (1959) explained, for example, the  time required to hire and develop experienced  and committed managers can act as a brake on  growth. Once new managerial resources have  been developed, however, they accelerate growth  as the firm places its new managers into produc-  tive service. Subsequent to Penrose's work, other  resources such as the development of organi-  zational routines (Nelson and Winter, 1982;  Shane, 1996) and access to capital (Martin and  Justis, 1993) have been shown to have similar  effects on organizational growth rates. Growth-  minded firms thus are often compelled to identify  ways to overcome resource scarcities (Mahoney  and Pandian, 1992). One common solution is to  engage in interfirm cooperation in order to grow  with the aid of a partner's resources (Erramilli  and Rao, 1990; Ingham and Thompson, 1994).  Indeed, because firms can often perform activities  together that neither could perform alone,  resource sharing has become a primary expla-  nation for interfirm cooperation (Borys and Jemi-  son, 1989; Hamel, 1991).  Regarding performance, resource-based differ-  THEORETICAL BACKGROUND  Although the RBV and OE approaches to stra-  tegic management both grew from traditions  within economics (Rumelt, Schendel, and Teece,  1994), they differ considerably in terms of the  factors believed to influence organizational action  and the performance consequences of such  actions.  The resource-based view  Resources can be defined as 'those assets that  are tied semi-permanently to the firm'  (Wererfelt, 1984: 173). Some authors make a  distinction between resources and capabilities  wherein capabilities refer to skills based in human  competencies and resources refer to all other  assets (e.g., Markides and Williamson, 1996).  Following Barney (1991) and Peteraf (1993), we  use the term resources broadly to refer to both  Copyright ? 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  Strat. Mgmt.

In other words,  resource differences among firms drive  product/service differences. Because buyers often  favor the outputs of some resource configurations  over others, performance differences emerge  (Wernerfelt, 1984). The sustainability of these  differences depends on the difficulty competitors  have in accessing similar resources (Barney,  1991; Dierickx and Cool, 1989).  To be a source of sustained above-average  performance, resources must meet three criteria.  They must be: (1) valuable, meaning buyers are  willing to purchase the resources' outputs at  prices significantly above their costs; (2) rare, so  that buyers cannot turn to competitors with the  same or substitute resources; and (3) imperfectly  imitable, meaning it is difficult for competitors  to either imitate or purchase the resources  (Barney, 1991; Peteraf, 1993). Further, the ability  of a resource to meet these criteria depends on  industry characteristics that affect a resource's  value (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993). Brand name  reputation, for example, may be more valuable  in experiential service industries than in industries  where quality can be determined prior to purchase  (Nayyar, 1990). Resources that are rare, difficult  to imitate, and create value in a given industry  are labeled 'strategic resources' (Chi, 1994).  Orgsnizational economics  Whereas resource-based research focuses on the  implications of resources for organizational action  and performance, OE's central concern is iden-  tifying actions that minimize the costs of govern-  ance which, in turn, maximize performance. Over-  all, OE offers a means to explain the way  economic activity is organized (Barney and  Ouchi, 1986). From the view of OE, the various  intra- and interfirm arrangements observed in con-  temporary economies represent alternative ways  of organizing the exchange of goods and services  in the context of self-interested behavior, diverg-  ing goals, and imperfect information (Hesterly et  al., 1990). Such arrangements offer a variety of  incentive systems and authority relationships that  are not available to participants in simple market  transactions (Williamson, 1975). Any given  arrangement can thus be viewed as an attempt to  minimize the cost of economic exchange by  aligning authority relationships and incentives to  the unique conditions surrounding the exchange.  The important conditions that affect an  exchange are perhaps best described by the two  theories most central to the OE paradigm: trans-  action costs and agency theory. The former  focuses on the characteristics of an exchange that  encourage managers to increase firm boundaries  (i.e., full ownership), share with others (i.e., inter-  firm cooperation), or exchange in markets.1  Among the exchange conditions initially identified  by Williamson (1975), asset specificity is perhaps  the most robust empirically (Williamson, 1994).  Specific assets, in contrast to general purpose  assets, are costly to redeploy to alternative uses  (Williamson, 1991). Asset specificity generally  encourages enlargement of a firm's boundaries  because, if the firm invests in specific assets in  the context of a cooperative arrangement, it has  little recourse if a partner attempts to alter the  terms of their agreement post hoc (Anderson and  Coughlan, 1987; Monteverde and Teece, 1982).  If such opportunism arises, the firm faces an  unpleasant choice between continuing to work  with its recalcitrant partner or forgoing the  expected value of its specific assets.  Under certain conditions, however, asset speci-  ficity encourages interfirm cooperation  (Williamson, 1983). When both firms in a coop-  erative agreement must invest in specific assets,  the assets form a reciprocal dependency that  reduces each partner's incentive to engage in  opportunism, thus reducing the costs of interfirm  cooperation (Dyer, 1996; Klein and Murphy,  ' We draw exclusively from Williamson's version of trans-  action cost theory, which has, over time, come to rely heavily  on asset specificity to explain organizational form  (Williamson, 1994). We acknowledge, however, that other  researchers conceive transaction costs more broadly. Accord-  ing to this broader view, anything that affects the short- or  long-run costs of conducting market exchange can be con-  sidered a 'transaction cost' (e.g., Coase, 1988; North, 1990).  Following this logic, constructs developed in the resource-  based literature can perhaps be considered 'transaction costs'  because these constructs affect the choice of organizational  form. However, this broader view of transaction costs has yet  to receive the same theoretical development that has been  given to Williamson's narrower approach (Coase, 1988).  Further, Williamson's version of transaction cost theory is  more accessible to practitioners and other noneconomists and  therefore it is the most commonly used statement of trans-  action cost found in strategic management research (Ghoshal  and Moran, 1996). For these reasons, we rely on Williamson's  'narrow' version of transaction cost theory in this study.  Copyright ? 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  Strat. Mgmt.

Ketchen, Jr.  1988; Teece, 1987). Hence, whereas unilateral  investments in specific assets should lead to full  ownership, mutual investments can encourage  cooperation.  A second OE perspective, positive agency  theory,2 focuses on exchanges wherein one  party, the principal, delegates responsibility to  another, the agent (Eisenhardt, 1989; Jensen  and Meckling, 1976). Unless induced to behave  otherwise, self-interested agents are expected to  pursue their own goals, not those of principals.  As a result, the firm (as principal) must spend  resources monitoring and controlling the  behavior of its agents (e.g., employees, man-  agers, cooperative partners). The costs of such  monitoring varies with the ease with which  information about agents' job performance is  available and can be effectively evaluated  (Eisenhardt, 1989). In situations where the costs  of direct monitoring are high, principals often  substitute incentives that redirect agents' goals  toward principals' rather than attempting to  oversee agents' activities directly (Eisenhardt,  1989). Forcing agents to take an equity position  in the operations under their control is a com-  mon way to realign agents' goals (Phan and  Hill, 1995). Interfirm cooperation offers this  type of incentive because cooperative partners'  rewards are largely dependent upon their own  performance outcomes (e.g., Shane, 1996).  Although interfirm cooperation can be used to  reduce the need for costly direct monitoring by  the firm (Bradach, 1997), it can create a new set  of potential agency problems. Specifically, after  an interfirm cooperative agreement has been  reached, both parties may possess incentives to  'shirk' by reducing their inputs at the expense of  their cooperative partner. As in the case of trans-  action costs, the solution to this problem is that  each party must make binding and credible com-  mitments to the other. In the context of franchis-  ing, for example, franchisees (i.e., agents) make  highly specific investments in their outlets and  franchisors (i.e., principals) invest heavily in  advertising (Williamson, 1983). Consequently,  staying fully engaged in this cooperative venture  offers each partner the highest potential for maxi-  mizing profits.  The exchange conditions described in OE  research are generally not associated directly  with performance (Williamson, 1994). Rather,  these variables (e.g., asset specificity) only  affect performance after organizational arrange-  ments have been selected to monitor and control  the behavior of organizational participants.  Superior performance is expected when, given  the conditions of exchange, organizational  arrangements are selected that minimize the  costs of governing participants. In contrast,  competitors that ignore exchange conditions  when choosing among alternative organizational  arrangements should experience relatively  higher governance costs and therefore lower  performance (Hill and Snell, 1988; Phan and  Hill, 1995). Thus, the relation between OE  exchange conditions and performance is contin-  gent upon the selection of organizational  arrangements that minimize potential opportun-  ism and align the goals of participants with  those of the firm (Hill, Hitt, and Hoskisson,  1992; Mahoney, 1992).  In sum, the RBV and OE are widely cited  perspectives that inform questions of interfirm  cooperation and cooperation's performance conse-  quences. The RBV is focused on the effects of  resource endowments on managerial action and  performance. When facing resource limitations,  managers are attracted to cooperative arrange-  ments designed to overcome such constraints. OE  theories, in contrast, concentrate on the costs of  controlling any organized effort. When the use  of interfirm cooperation is directed toward the  minimization of these costs, good performance  should result.  2 There are two streams of agency literature. The principal-  agent stream is found primarily in the economics literature  and uses mathematical models to demonstrate how optimal  employment contracts can be designed under various sets of  assumptions. This branch is generally not considered compat-  ible with strategic management (Rumelt, Schendel, and Teece,  1994). The positivist branch, however, seeks to identify real-  world governance problems and to understand the mechanisms  firms use to solve them (Eisenhardt, 1989; Mahoney, 1992).  Relating the resource-based view and  organizational economics  Broadly speaking, two patterns can be seen in  the literature that help define how the RBV and  OE are related. First, the RBV and OE can be  portrayed as independent explanations in which  one perspective is used to explain a phenomenon  with little consideration of the other. For example,  much of the research on vertical integration and  Copyright ? 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  Strat. Mgmt.

As noted above, the strategic value of  a resource can be industry-specific (Amit and  Schoemaker, 1993). Thus, the choice of which  resources to investigate must be informed by  knowledge about the industry. Furthermore, the  way a specific form of interfirm cooperation is  implemented varies among industries (e.g.,  Ingham and Thomas, 1994). Such variance affects  the efficacy of a given form to minimize govern-  ance costs in the presence of an OE variable  (Williamson, 1991). Consequently, it is important  to view RBV and OE hypotheses in relation to  the industry under investigation. Service indus-  tries appear to be under-represented in the litera-  ture relative to their importance; thus we exam-  ined restaurant chains. The largest 100 chains  operate over 110,000 outlets in the United States  alone (Ritzer, 1993); when to use interfirm  cooperation, if at all, in managing these vast  empires is a key question for chains' top man-  agers (Shook and Shook, 1993).  Given the variety of resource and exchange  condition variables that have been studied pre-  viously, any single investigation is unlikely to be  exhaustive. Hence, the focus here is on three  resources and three exchange conditions that are  frequently cited as important both (1) within RBV  or OE research, and (2) by research on res-  taurant chains.  The influence of resources on interfirm  cooperation  Interfirm cooperation makes fewer resource  demands than full ownership because individual  firms do not have to supply all resources. If a  firm possesses some but not all needed resources,  a common response is to combine resources with  an external organization using a cooperative  arrangement (Erramilli and Rao, 1990; Teece,  1987). For the resource-constrained firm, the pri-  mary advantage of this tactic is that markets can  be entered more quickly than if full ownership  is used (Oviatt and McDougall, 1994). This is a  critical concern in many contexts, including those  where windows of opportunity are short or there  are significant first mover advantages (Wernerfelt  and Karani, 1987). In this study, two strategic  international entry mode is grounded in OE (e.g.,  Anderson and Coughlan, 1987; Monteverde and  Teece, 1982; see Argyres, 1996 for a recent  exception), whereas the study of the evolution of  competitive advantage is usually grounded in the  RBV (e.g., Barnett, Greve, and Park, 1994; Lev-  inthal and Myatt, 1994). The independent view  may be due to the RBV's emphasis on identifying  which resources require enhancements; OE  focuses on how to manage those resources once  identified (Wernerfelt, 1989). A second view is  that the RBV and OE are complementary, each  offering unique insights that generally point man-  agers in similar directions. The complementary  view is, in part, grounded in the recognition that  specific assets share an important quality with  strategic resources-both are difficult to trade or  imitate (Chi, 1994; Peteraf, 1993). This com-  monality explains why high performance among  firms with certain diversification postures can be  explained as a product of efficient organizational  governance (Hill et al., 1992; Teece, 1982) or  the exploitation of strategic resources in new  markets (Chatterjee and Wernerfelt, 1991; Mar-  kides and Williamson, 1996; Robins and Wier-  sema, 1995). The complementary view is also  reflected in Gray and Wood's (1991) suggestion  that neither resource nor economics-based per-  spectives adequately explain collaboration but  rather that both perspectives are needed.  In addition to the independent and comple-  mentary views, the relationship between the  RBV and OE can be conflictive. For example,  Conner and Prahalad (1996) suggest that, from  the RBV, housing an activity within an organi-  zation's hierarchy may be preferred over market  transactions even when managers confront no  fear of opportunism, which is the driving force  toward ownership under OE. We submit that the  decision whether or not to engage in interfirm  cooperation is one such instance wherein pre-  scriptions from the RBV and OE can conflict.  Specifically, managers confront a dilemma when  resource constraints point managers toward  interfirm cooperation in situations where  cooperation is not an efficient response to  exchange conditions. Further, firms that use  interfirm cooperation according to the predic-  tions of the RBV may perform quite differently  from those whose use of interfirm cooperation  is best explained by OE. Our investigation  offers an initial look at this quandary.  Copyright ? 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  Strat. Mgmt.

Ketchen, Jr.  resources, brand name reputation and top man-  agement experience, and one important nonstra-  tegic resource, slack capital, are examined.  Brand name reputation is critical in the res-  taurant industry because it is a key determinant  of whether or not potential customers patronize  an establishment. Indeed, because restaurants  offer an experiential good (cf. Nayyar, 1990),  customers often make first-time purchases based  on brand name reputation (Luxenberg, 1985;  Shook and Shook, 1993). Restaurant chains build  reputations by establishing multiple outlets within  a region, thereby creating visibility as well as  economies of scale in both advertising and pur-  chasing. Because outlets can be built more  quickly using a network of cooperative partners  (Martin and Justis, 1993; Shane, 1996), interfirm  cooperation offers a viable route for rapidly build-  ing a brand name. Thus, chains with unknown  brand names should engage in more interfirm  cooperation than those with established brand  names.3  capital can be rare (e.g., Martin and Justis, 1993),  which is one important quality of a strategic  resource (Barney, 1991). Further, the rarity of  capital has been shown to affect the choice of  interfirm cooperation. Scarcity of slack capital  increases the use of both joint ventures (Ingham  and Thompson, 1994) and franchising (Martin  and Justis, 1993)-the two central forms of inter-  firm cooperation in the restaurant industry. The  reason the use of interfirm cooperation is higher  among capital scarce firms is because suppliers  of capital (e.g., banks and stockholders) confront  an adverse selection problem when choosing  among alternative investment opportunities.  Because passive investors must act on the basis  of publicly available information, they cannot  know a priori which firms have (1)offered full  disclosure of information, or (2) will continue to  act in investors' best interest over the long term  (Martin and Justis, 1993). Consequently, the price  of capital is determined by investors' expectation  concerning the average firm's risk level, causing  low-risk firms to 'select out' of the market  An experienced and knowledgeable top man-  agement team (TMT) can also be a strategic  (Stiglitz and Weiss, 1981).

Because  can often supply lower-cost capital because  (1) they are not exposed to the same agency costs  the restaurant industry is relatively stable, execu-  that result from a separation of ownership and  tives with knowledge of operational practices and  control (cf.

Thus, we expect  controls that offer a foundation for long-term  success (Justis and Judd, 1989; Shook and Shook,  scarcities of slack capital to be associated with  1993). For firms lacking a well-seasoned TMT,  greater use of interfirm cooperation among res-  cooperation may be attractive because partners  taurants.  can furnish (1) skilled local managers that require  minimal supervision, (2) a pool of expertise for  top managers to draw upon, and (3) increased  market penetration, which can improve the firm's  ability to attract new managerial talent (Bradach,  1997; Shane, 1996).  Overall, from the RBV, the sufficiency of  firms' existing resource endowments is an  important influence on the use of interfirm  cooperation. Accordingly, we predict that, among  restaurant chains, resources and interfirm  cooperation will be inversely related. Specifically:  A third variable, slack capital, is generally not  considered to be a strategic resource (cf. Barney,  1991). In certain circumstances, however, slack  Hypothesis la: Brand name reputation and  interfirm cooperation will be negatively  related.  3 One could construct a similar argument using OE; brand  name is a specific asset that must be protected from potential  opportunism through company ownership (e.g., Michael,  1998). Although we acknowledge that brand name can reason-  ably be examined using either perspective, firms in the res-  taurant industry have several tools to reduce potential oppor-  tunism (e.g., denying partner's expansion requests-Bradach,  1997). These mechanisms do not necessitate company owner-  ship. Thus, we examine brand name in this study from  the RBV.  Hypothesis lb: TMT experience and interfirm  cooperation will be negatively related.  Hypothesis Ic: Slack capital and interfirm  cooperation will be negatively related.

Asset  specificity is a key exchange condition in the  context of interfirm cooperation because such  investments expose one party in a cooperative  agreement to the potential for costly opportunistic  behavior by the other. In the restaurant industry,  cooperative partners could supply low-quality  inputs and, because of the transient nature of  the industry, pass much of the cost of customer  dissatisfaction along to other outlets in the chain  (Brickley and Dark, 1987). Likewise, firm man-  agers could reduce efforts to promote and upgrade  the chain, leaving cooperative partners with lower  revenues (Scott, 1995).  One solution to these problems can be found  in the binding and credible commitments that are  available to reduce the potential for opportunism  (Williamson, 1983). Firm managers make two  important commitments to their cooperative part-  ners that signal ongoing commitment. First, the  presence of company-owned outlets signals coop-  erative partners that the firm is committed to  promoting and upgrading the chain (Minkler,  1992). Second, regardless of the form of the  cooperative arrangement (i.e., franchise, joint  venture), a significant portion of the firm's rev-  enues are contingent upon sales at outlets owned  by cooperative partners (Scott, 1995). The value  of these revenues depends on firm managers'  ongoing investment in chain-wide enhancements  (e.g., advertising, new product development). In  exchange for these commitments, firm managers  expect that their cooperative partners will also  make significant and credible commitments.  Cooperative partners generally build, or help  build, restaurants for a chain. If assets required  to operate these new outlets (e.g., physical plant,  kitchen equipment) cannot be easily transformed  for use in another type of restaurant or another  business (i.e., the assets are highly specific), then  cooperative partners must continue to cooperate  with the firm in order to recover their investment.  Thus, investments in outlet-level specific assets  tie cooperative partners to the chain, making  interfirm cooperation attractive to the chain (Klein  and Murphy, 1988).  Another important exchange condition is the  type of knowledge that must be transferred  between principal and agent. Knowledge can be  categorized as general knowledge that is easy to  transfer to agents or specific knowledge that is  costly to transfer (Jensen and Meckling, 1995).  Specific knowledge can become embedded in the  operational systems of restaurant chains as they  evolve (Darr, Argote, and Epple, 1995). Once  created, specific knowledge can help reduce costs  and improve service, thus becoming a source of  competitive advantage (Collis, 1994). However,  specific knowledge is often tacit (Polanyi, 1962)  or complex (Shane, 1998) and therefore costly  to transfer to agents (Jensen and Meckling, 1995);  it is best learned through experience and practice  rather than through explanation (Kogut and  Zander, 1992). Consequently, specific knowledge  flows more easily within firms than between them  (Darr et al., 1995). Thus, among retail operations  such as restaurants, company ownership is pre-  ferred when extensive training and support are  needed to facilitate transfer of specific knowledge  (Lafontaine, 1992; Scott, 1995).  A third variable, the geographic dispersion of  operations, affects the costs of organizing in many  service industries where operations must be  located in close proximity to consumers (Carman  and Langeard, 1980). According to agency theory,  constraints to the free flow of information  increase the cost of monitoring managers'  behavior (Eisenhardt, 1989; Roth and O'Donnell,  1996). Within restaurant chains, outlet-level man-  agers are generally monitored by district and  regional managers with the aid of the chain's  information system (Bradach, 1997). As geo-  graphic dispersion increases, the firm must hire  additional district and regional managers to visit  and monitor outlet-level managers. One way to  minimize this cost is to delegate this responsi-  bility to cooperative partners who are closer to  the outlets (Brickley and Dark, 1987; Rubin,  1990). Thus, the attractiveness of interfirm  cooperation increases as a chain disperses geo-  graphically.  In sum, we predict that, among restaurant  chains, certain exchange conditions will be posi-  tively related to the use of interfirm cooperation  whereas other conditions discourage its use.

Stated formally:  firms facing other resource/exchange combi-  nations. Interfirm cooperation will be prevalent  among firms with favorable exchange conditions  and firms confronting resource scarcities. Stated  formally, we expect the following:  Hypothesis 2a: Outlet-level asset specificity  and interfirm cooperation will be positively  related.  Hypothesis 2b: Specific knowledge and inter-  firm cooperation will be negatively related.  Hypothesis 2c: Geographic dispersion and  interfirm cooperation will be positively related.  Hypothesis 3: The combination of high  resource levels and unfavorable exchange con-  ditions (low outlet-level asset specificity and  geographic dispersion, and high specific  knowledge) will be negatively related to inter-  firm cooperation. Other combinations (low  resource levels with any exchange conditions  and high resource levels with favorable  exchange conditions) will be positively related  to interfirm cooperation.  The joint influence of resources and exchange  conditions on interfirm cooperation  This hypothesis is depicted visually in Figure 1.  Determinants of firm performance  If both sets of Hypotheses (Hypotheses la-c  and 2a-c) accurately depict decisions regarding  interfirm cooperation, a dilemma is created when  a firm's resources and exchange conditions exert  pressure in different directions. Specifically, what  is a firm to do when resource constraints push  managers toward interfirm cooperation even  though cooperation may not be the efficient  choice from an OE perspective? Our contention  is that resources moderate firms' responses to  exchange conditions. A firm without sufficient  resources to exploit opportunities using full own-  ership has an incentive to use interfirm  cooperation because cooperation permits the firm  to leverage its resources in combination with  other firms for long-term competitive advantage  (Erramilli and Rao, 1990; Mahoney and Pandian,  1992)-regardless of whether or not cooperation  may result in higher governance costs. Such  firms' lack of resources simply will not allow  them to rely heavily on full ownership even if it  is preferred from an OE perspective. In essence,  resources serve as a 'litmus test' for the consider-  ation of exchange-related issues in the interfirm  cooperation decision.  In contrast, when resources do not present a  significant constraint, managers are empowered  to use full ownership or interfirm cooperation,  whichever is the most efficient form of govern-  ance. Thus, firms with exchange conditions that  make cooperation costly (labeled 'unfavorable' in  the hypothesis below) and ample resources will  rely on full ownership more heavily than will  Strategic resources evolve along different and  unique trajectories (Barnett et al., 1994) and these  differences lead to important product differences  and/or differences in production costs (Argyres,  1996; Barney, 1991). When resources enable a  firm to establish either a lower cost structure or  demand a price premium for its products or ser-  vices, then the opportunity for superior profits  exists (Porter, 1980). Furthermore, when the  advantage afforded by these resources is difficult  for competitors to imitate or purchase, superior  profits are sustainable (Barney, 1991; Peteraf,  1993). Thus, from the RBV, the link between  strategic resources and performance is direct.  Indeed, Rumelt (1991) provided evidence that  differences in the configuration of strategic  resources better predict performance differences  than do industry or market characteristics.  The two strategic resources examined here-  brand name reputation and top management  experience-are purportedly important to res-  taurant chain success (Shook and Shook, 1993).  Brand name reputation is among the most critical  factors influencing long-term success in the res-  taurant industry because it adds perceived value  to a chain's service and is difficult for competitors  to imitate (Barney, 1991; Itami, 1987). With  respect to top management experience, executives  with deep roots in the industry and firm often  develop a unique base of knowledge that enables  them to uphold the consistent standards necessary  Copyright ? 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Regarding slack capital, the  third resource examined in this study, there is no  extant logic linking nonstrategic resources with  performance, thus no relevant hypothesis is  offered here. In sum, we predict that, among  restaurant chains, strategic resources and perform-  ance will be positively related. Specifically:  to enjoy greater efficiency in motivating, monitor-  ing, and evaluating operations; such administra-  tive proficiency should be reflected in perform-  ance (Williamson, 1994).

Specifically, (a) the combination of unfavor-  able exchange conditions (i.e., low outlet-level  asset specificity and geographic dispersion,  and high specific knowledge) and low interfirm  cooperation, and (b) the combination offavor-  able exchange conditions (i.e., high outlet-level  asset specificity and geographic dispersion,  and low specific knowledge) and high interfirm  cooperation will be positively related to per-  formance.  This hypothesis is depicted visually in Figure 2.  Hypothesis 4b: Top management team  experience and performance will be positively  related.  Whereas the RBV ties resources directly to per-  formance, the OE literature asserts a contingency  relationship between exchange conditions, inter-  firm cooperation, and performance (Hill and  Snell, 1988; Williamson, 1994). After analyzing  their exchange conditions, managers are expected  to select an organizational form that minimizes  the governance costs associated with conducting  the organization's activities. If managers choose  wisely, governance costs are minimized and prof-  its are maximized (e.g., Dyer, 1996; Hill et al.,  1992). Above, we predicted that the three  exchange conditions examined here affect the use  of interfirm cooperation: outlet-level asset speci-  ficity offers firm managers a credible commitment  thereby reducing the risk of opportunism, specific  knowledge increases the cost of interfirm  cooperation by accentuating communication  difficulties, and geographic dispersion makes  interfirm cooperation attractive by raising the cost  of monitoring fully-owned operations. In essence,  OE argues that firms will perform best by com-  paring their governance costs under full owner-  ship and interfirm cooperation and selecting the  least costly option. Chains that do so are expected  METHOD  Sample and data sources  The hypotheses were tested across restaurant  chains that were publicly held between 1992 and  1995. Firms that did not constitute a chain (at  least four outlets-Hawes and Crittenden, 1984),  were franchisees (e.g., of chains such as McDon-  ald's or Wendy's), or whose food service was a  component of a larger operation (e.g., hotels and  casinos) were excluded.

Data for one  resource (TMT experience), one exchange con-  dition (geographic dispersion), interfirm  cooperation, and two control variables (age and  growth) were obtained from annual reports, proxy  statements, and 10-Ks. Although chains reported  this information in a variety of formats, all infor-  mation was reported. As others have found (e.g.,  Michel and Hambrick, 1992), coding was  straightforward owing to the objective nature of  the data.  There were 226 surveys returned. Forty-four  respondents did not rate any chains because they  did not feel qualified to make the requested judg-  ments, leaving a usable response rate of 45.5  percent-higher than the response rate obtained  in most strategic management research (Snow  and Thomas, 1994). On average, raters were  retrospective accounts of conditions 2 years earlier or we  could adopt, and support, the assumption that the three vari-  ables assessed in the survey are moderately invariant over  relatively short periods of time and ask for assessments of  current conditions. The major concern with the use of retro-  spective data is whether or not informants are capable of  accurately recalling some past event or condition. The use of  retrospective data has a long history in strategic management  research (e.g., Mintzberg, Raisinghani, and Theoret, 1976),  but such data are often misleading and inaccurate (Golden,  1992). In our case, we feared that asking about 1992 would  be a source of confusion in that experts would struggle to  mentally isolate 1992 from the years immediately preceding  and following; feedback received during the pretests confirmed  our fear.  Golden's study and our own pretests results led us to  examine the temporal stability of the focal variables. Specific  knowledge and outlet-level asset specificity tend to be stable  because they are defined by the very nature of a restaurant  chain's daily operations and physical infrastructure respec-  tively and firms rarely change their core infrastructure (cf.  Gersick, 1991)-especially in the restaurant industry  (Luxenberg, 1985; Shook and Shook, 1993). In contrast, it  could be argued that the third variable, brand name reputation,  can change in just a couple of years. This possibility was  investigated by examining how the relationship between the  expert panel measure of brand name reputation and an index  of a related but distinct variable, consumer satisfaction,  changed over the 2-year period. A customer satisfaction meas-  ure based on a random sample of over 2000 households'  satisfaction ratings is published annually in Restaurants and  Institutions. The ratings of between 70 and 80 restaurant  chains (depending on the year) in that survey overlap our  sample by 45 chains. The correlation between our measure  of brand name reputation and the satisfaction index was  significant in both years (0.42 in 1992 and 0.41 in 1994;  both p < 0.01), but not significantly different across the  years (Ar = 0.01; p > 0.10). Thus, there is at least indirect  evidence that brand name reputation was stable across 1992-  94. Overall, we believe the expert panel measures from 1994  to be realistic portrayals of conditions in 1992 and,  importantly, to be superior to measures that could have been  obtained through retrospective accounts.  Expert panel  No archival measures were available for two  exchange conditions (outlet-level asset specificity  and specific knowledge) and one resource meas-  ure (brand name reputation), thus these variables  were assessed through an expert panel survey  of hospitality management educators. In similar  research contexts, expert opinions furnished by  relevant academics have been shown to be an  effective and valid measure of unobservable con-  structs (Chen, Farh, and MacMillan, 1993).  Following a series of pretests, 400 hospitality  management professors were identified through  the Council for Hotel, Restaurant, and Insti-  tutional Educators (CHRIE), the major pro-  fessional association for hospitality educators. In  each of 10 regions of the United States, 40  experts were asked to rate an average of 10  chains headquartered in their region. Respondents  were asked to rate only those chains for which  they felt confident making an expert judgment.  The survey was constructed in 1994 and distrib-  uted following Dillman's (1978) total design  method.4  4 Because our resource and exchange condition measures  needed to depict conditions in 1992, we faced an important  trade-off. Expert panel respondents could be asked to furnish  Copyright ? 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  Strat. Mgmt.

The average  number of ratings for a chain was 9.3, with a  standard deviation of 6.1 and an average interrater  reliability of 0.81. Because late respondents' per-  ceptions match closely with those of nonrespon-  dents (Kanuk and Berenson, 1975), significant  correlations between item scores and survey  response time would indicate the presence of a  nonresponse bias. We examined all such corre-  lations; none were statistically significant.  Control variables  Several past studies use measures of age and size  as proxies for resource availability (e.g., Carney  and Gedajlovic, 1991; Lafontaine, 1992). Their  logic, centered in the life cycle concept, is that  resources tend to grow as firms mature. Because  resources are measured directly in this study, the  potential confounding effects of the life cycle  needed to be controlled. Therefore, the organi-  zation's age and total sales in 1992 were used  as control measures; the latter was not normally  distributed, thus its natural log was used. A firm's  growth rate is another variable that may affect  the choice of organizational form (Shane, 1996).  Growth was measured as the sum of new units  added during 1992 and 1993 divided by the  number of units that existed at the start of 1992.

Top management team (TMT) experience.  Although no consensus has been reached as to  which executives to include when studying TMTs,  one popular approach has been to include only  'inside directors' executives with a seat on the  board of directors (Bantel and Finkelstein, 1995).  This approach has the advantage of providing a  clear demarcation between top tier and second  tier managers. Furthermore, directorships indicate  membership in the dominant coalition and high  organizational power (Bantel and Finkelstein,  1995). Therefore, to measure TMT experience,  we compiled (1)the total number of years of  executive-level food service experience and  (2) the total number of years in the firm for  all inside directors in each restaurant chain as  of 1992.  Slack capital. We used slack measures pre-  viously used by Singh (1986) and Hambrick and  D'Aveni (1988). Each chain's equity-to-debt ratio  in 1992 was used to assess its amount of unused  borrowing capacity, or potential slack. Firms with  high equity-to-debt ratios can potentially borrow  more funds to finance expansion efforts than can  firms with low ratios. Available slack represents  highly liquid, existing capital that is available for  immediate investment. It was measured for 1992  as cash and marketable securities divided by the  number of outlets in the chain.  Exchange conditions  Brand name reputation. Data on brand name  reputation was culled through four items on the  expert panel survey: Comparing this company to  all other food service operations, (1)How well  respected is this company? (anchored by 'Not  respected' and 'Very respected'); (2) How good  of a value is this company perceived to provide  for the price? (Not good/Very good); (3) How  strong is this company's reputation for consistent  quality and service? (Not strong/Very strong);  and (4) How strong is this company's brand name  recognition in its service area? (Not strong/Very  strong). Seven-point Likert scales were used.  Each chain's brand name reputation was calcu-  lated by summing responses to the four questions  and dividing by the number of expert raters.  Thus, values could range from 4 (all raters gave  the chain the lowest possible score, 1, on all four  questions) to a high of 28 (all raters gave the  chain the highest possible score, 7, on all four  Outlet-level asset specificity was assessed through  four survey items: Comparing this company to  all other food service operations, (1)How diffi-  cult would it be to use this company's kitchen  equipment for another food service format?  (Anchored by 'Not difficult' and 'Very difficult');  (2) How difficult would it be to use this com-  pany's dining room decor for another food service  format? (Not difficult/Very difficult); (3) How  difficult would it be to convert an average unit's  building and grounds to another type of business?  (Not difficult/Very difficult); and (4)How cus-  tomized is the kitchen equipment for this com-  pany? (Not customized/Very customized). Seven-  point Likert scales were used.

(Not  difficult/Very difficult); and (4) How difficult  would it be to include all of the unit manager's  job tasks in an operations manual? (Not  difficult/Very difficult). Seven-point Likert scales  were used.  Geographic dispersion. Two measures that  reflect a chain's geographic dispersion and that  have been studied extensively among retail chains  (e.g., Carney and Gedajlovic, 1991; Lafontaine,  1992) were examined here: the number of states  and number of countries with operations in 1992.  Interfirm cooperation  Most interfirm cooperation in the restaurant indus-  try is structured as franchises or joint ventures.5  Although franchises and joint ventures are quite  different forms in many industries, the differences  between them are rather small in the restaurant  industry. A franchise exists when a cooperative  partner supplies equity, management, and pays  the firm a fee in exchange for use of the latter's  trademark and operational standards (Justis and  Judd, 1989). Joint ventures in this industry are  structured similarly except that the firm takes a  substantial (usually 50%) equity position in out-  lets managed by its cooperative partners.  Our measure of interfirm cooperation had to  reflect the pattern of interfirm cooperation that  chains used in response to resource and exchange  conditions present at the beginning of the study  period. Thus, interfirm cooperation was measured  as the percent of growth accomplished through  interfirm cooperation during 1992 and 1993. That  is, we divided the number of new restaurants  5 Five sample firms structured a small minority of their outlets  as management contracts. Under these cooperative arrange-  ments, an outside cooperative partner constructs and owns the  outlet(s), which are then managed by the chain for a fee.  Although management contracts constitute interfirm  cooperation wherein two or more otherwise sovereign organi-  zations act in concert to pursue mutual gain, from the perspec-  tive of chain managers, these outlets engender exchange con-  ditions similar to company ownership. Consequently, we  eliminated these outlets from the calculation of our interfirm  cooperation measure. Doing so had an inconsequential effect  on the results.  built with cooperative partners by the total added  to the chain (cooperative ventures plus wholly-  owned facilities) in those years. This measure-  ment period was selected for three reasons. First,  the interfirm cooperation measure begins in the  same year as the resource and exchange condition  variables because many chains can implement  growth decisions (i.e., build restaurants) in less  than a year (e.g., McDonald's can build a free-  standing unit in 6 weeks). Second, a 2-year period  was selected because it is consistent with strategic  planning and implementation horizons discussed  in many chains' annual reports and 10-Ks. Third,  the 2-year measure is an improvement on studies  that use the proportion of interfirm cooperation  over the firm's entire life span (e.g., Carney and  Gedajlovic, 1991) because that measure con-  founds 5, 10, or even 20-year-old changes in  strategic direction by aggregating interfirm  cooperation over extended periods of time.  Performance variables  Performance is a multidimensional construct; thus  multiple, disparate measures should be examined  (Venkatraman and Ramanujam, 1986). Accord-  ingly, we measured performance from both a  financial and a stock market perspective. In keep-  ing with prior strategic management research  (e.g., Hill et al., 1992), return on assets (ROA)  was used to measure financial performance. This  is a measure of the efficiency of business oper-  ations (Hill et al., 1992). Our market performance  measure, market-to-book value, approximates the  stock market's perception of the value of the  firm's present and future income and growth  potential (Montgomery, Thomas, and Kamath,  1984). Because market-to-book value measures  performance at the corporate level, following the  standards set by Rumelt (1974), only single and  dominant chain firms (those with over 70% of  revenues derived from a single chain) were  included in this part of the analysis.6 This meas-  ure was available for 77 of the 94 chains.  Based on comments by restaurant CEOs in  firm's annual reports, we believed that the choice  6 Although Rumelt's standards were based on a firm's diversi-  fication into different businesses, they are used here to guide  measurement at the chain level because, for a restaurant chain,  ownership of different chains is operationally analogous to  related diversification (Carman and Langeard, 1980).

Therefore, performance  measures were averaged over 1994 and 1995, the  2 years immediately following the last year of our  interfirm cooperation measure. The performance  measures were averaged over 2 years to guard  against any 1-year 'outlier' performance (cf.  Thomas, Clark, and Gioia, 1993).  Data analysis  Confirmatory factor analysis  Construct validity of the three variables measured  through the expert panel (outlet-level asset speci-  ficity, specific knowledge, and brand name  reputation) was assessed through confirmatory  factor analysis of the total set of ratings produced  by the experts (N = 874). Three factors emerged  with all items loading on their theoretically cor-  rect factor. Average loadings for variables on  their theoretically correct factor was 0.81,  whereas the average loading on other factors was  0.08. Reliability coefficients were 0.87, 0.86, and  0.85 for brand name reputation, specific knowl-  edge, and outlet-level asset specificity respec-  tively, surpassing Nunnally's (1978) standards for  reliability in basic research. Thus, there was sup-  porting evidence vis-a-vis construct validity.  The usual way to test for interactions among  continuous variables (such as in Hypotheses 3  and 5) is with moderated regression (Aiken and  West, 1991). However, Hypothesis 3 is unique  in that it is an a priori ordinal interaction, where  one independent variable (i.e., exchange  conditions) affects the dependent variable (i.e.,  interfirm cooperation) at only one level of the  other independent variable (i.e., resources). By  analogy to the basic 2 x 2 factorial design in  ANOVA, an a priori ordinal interaction exists  when one cell is significantly different from the  other three and the 'unique' cell has been speci-  fied a priori (e.g., when resource levels are high  and exchange conditions render cooperation  costly, chains are expected to use cooperation  significantly less than under other  resource/exchange condition combinations-see  Figure 1). If moderated regression is used, main  effects can mask the interaction even if the inter-  action (i.e., the unique cell) is the only important  effect on the dependent variable (see Bobko,  1986, for an empirical demonstration). Instead,  the appropriate analytical technique is a simple  planned comparison of hypothesized differences  (i.e., one cell vs. the other three).  Accordingly, after placing firms into the four  cells portrayed in Figure 1 based on resource and  exchange condition variable medians, we created  two groups: those firms expected to prefer full  ownership according to Hypothesis 3 (the top left  cell of Figure 1) vs. those expected to prefer  interfirm cooperation (all firms in the other three  cells). Because variance explained by the control  variables had to be removed first, ANCOVA was  used to perform the planned comparison.  One exchange condition variable (geographic  dispersion) and two resource variables (slack  capital and top management experience) had  multiple archival measures. Confirmatory factor  analysis also supported the validity of these meas-  ures with average loadings of 0.84 for items on  their theoretically correct factor and 0.06 on other  factors. The measures of each of the three vari-  ables were standardized and then summed to  create unit-weighted scales.  Hypothesis testing  Hypotheses la-c and 2a-c were tested using  regression analysis. Hypotheses 4a-b, which  specified direct relationships between resources  and performance, were also tested using  regression. In testing Hypotheses 4a-b, we  included interfirm cooperation as an additional  control variable to ensure that resource effects on  performance were direct and not mediated by  interfirm cooperation.  Hypothesis 5, in contrast to Hypothesis 3, is  an a priori disordinal interaction in which one  independent variable (i.e., interfirm cooperation)  affects the dependent variable (i.e., performance)  differently at different levels of the other inde-  pendent variable (i.e., exchange conditions).  Using the 2 x 2 factorial analogy again, two  diagonal cells are expected to be different from  the other two (see Figure 2). The luxury of direct  planned comparison does not exist here because  it cannot be known whether results are due to  any one cell rather than the hypothesized two  cells. Moderated regression was therefore used as  an initial test of the hypothesis because it is the  most powerful technique for detecting disordinal  interactions among continuous data (Aiken and  Copyright ? 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Ketchen, Jr.  West, 1991). Once moderated regression iden-  tified the presence of an interaction effect, firms  were partitioned into subgroups based on median  exchange condition and interfirm cooperation  values and group means were inspected to see if  the nature of the interaction was consistent with  Hypothesis 5 as depicted in Figure 2.  RESULTS  Table 1 reports descriptive statistics and Pearson  product-moment correlations among measures  used in the study. Table 2 displays the results  relevant to our initial predictions. Hypotheses la-  c predicted that chains' levels of three resources  would be inversely related to the use of interfirm  cooperation. Our predictions were supported for  brand name reputation (Hla: 13 = -0.25; p <  0.05) and slack capital (Hlc: p = -0.25; p <  0.05) but not for top management experience  (Hlb: P = -0.01; n.s.). Hypotheses 2a-c pre-  dicted a direct relationship between exchange  conditions and interfirm cooperation. All three  sub-hypotheses were supported: outlet-level asset  specificity (H2a: 13 = 0.20; p < 0.05) and geo-  graphic dispersion (H2c: 13 = 0.39; p < 0.01)  were positively related to interfirm cooperation  whereas specific knowledge (H2b: p = -0.23; p  < 0.05) was negatively related.  experience was not significantly related to either  performance measure (1 = 0.11; n.s., and P =  0.10; n.s., for ROA and market-to-book  respectively).  Regarding Hypothesis 5, the second and fourth  regression equations in Table 5 show that the  interaction terms for both ROA (3 = 0.29; p <  0.01) and market-to-book value (3 = 0.28; p  <0.05) were significant. This offered initial sup-  port for our expectation that exchange conditions  and interfirm cooperation interact to affect per-  formance. The next step was to partition the firms  into groups according to their median exchange  condition and interfirm cooperation values and  inspect the nature of the interaction. As shown  in Table 6, group mean values revealed some  deviations from the predictions of Hypothesis 5.  When both performance variables are considered,  the interaction appears to be largely a function  of significantly lower performance among firms  using interfirm cooperation when exchange con-  ditions pointed toward full ownership (i.e., those  in the top left cell of Table 6). In addition, when  market-to-book value is considered, there was a  positive performance effect for firms using inter-  firm cooperation when exchange conditions made  this an appropriate choice (i.e., the top right cell).  Finally, in contrast to our expectations, firms that  made greater use of full ownership when  exchange conditions facilitate interfirm  cooperation performed as well as those who acted  in accordance with their exchange conditions (i.e.,  bottom left cell vs. bottom right). Overall, there  was mixed evidence regarding Hypothesis 5: an  interaction effect between exchange conditions  and interfirm cooperation on performance was  found, but the nature of the interaction was only  partially consistent with expectations.  As shown in Table 3, there was a significant  resource-exchange condition interaction effect on  interfirm cooperation (F = 23.52; p < 0.001). As  predicted, firms that possessed high resource lev-  els and faced exchange conditions that facilitate  full ownership (i.e., low outlet-level asset speci-  ficity, high specific knowledge, and low geo-  graphic dispersion) used interfirm cooperation sig-  nificantly less than other firms. Indeed, as shown  in Table 4, firms in this situation used interfirm  cooperation in an average of 5 percent of their  new outlets whereas firms facing other resource  and exchange condition contingencies on average  used interfirm cooperation between seven to ten  times more often. Together, the results in these  tables offer support for Hypothesis 3.  Table 5 shows the results for Hypotheses 4a-  b and 5. Brand name reputation was a significant  predictor of ROA (P = 0.21; p < 0.05) but not  market-to-book value (1 = 0.01; n.s.), offering  only partial support for Hypothesis 4a. No support  was found for Hypothesis 4b; top management  DISCUSSION  The resource-based view and organizational eco-  nomics have become regarded as valuable instru-  ments for enhancing knowledge of interfirm  cooperation, its antecedents, and its consequences.  Given these perspectives' different emphases,  they are generally treated as independent  approaches-despite considerable evidence that  complex relationships seldom can be fully under-  stood when viewed through a single theoretical  lens (e.g., Allison, 1971; Gray and Wood, 1991).

Experience  among top managers, however, did not affect  cooperation (Hypothesis lb). Given that past  research has established that top management  characteristics are related to a variety of organi-  zational phenomena (Bantel and Finkelstein, 1995),  perhaps inquiry examining whether or not mana-  gerial characteristics other than experience play a  role in decisions surrounding interfirm cooperation  may be fruitful. For example, heterogeneous TMTs  are thought to enact more innovative actions than  homogeneous teams (Bantel and Jackson, 1989);  perhaps the former are likely to devise new, creative  forms of interfirm cooperation.  This study offers new insight into how managers  resolve the sometimes conflicting demands of  resource and exchange conditions when deciding  whether or not to use interfirm cooperation and  establishes a link between the motivations for  interfirm cooperation and performance outcomes.  The effects of resources and exchange  conditions on interfirm cooperation  Consistent with the resource-based notion that  firms cooperate in order to gain access to critical  resources (Borys and Jemison, 1989; Hamel,  As others have found (e.g., Monteverde and  Teece, 1982), managers in this sample also  brought governance issues into focus when con-  sidering alternative ways to manage new outlets.  Given our intention to study OE variables that  are established in the literature, the support we  found for Hypotheses 2a-c is perhaps not surpris-  ing. Thus, this study adds to the substantial base  of empirical support for the OE approach (Rumelt  et al., 1994). Future inquiry should investigate a  broader array of variables, however, because the  number of factors that affect the cost of exchange  is potentially large (Coase, 1988; North, 1990).  Although our findings demonstrate that the  RBV and OE are each viable explanations for  interfirm cooperation, they offer more informative  insights when viewed in tandem.

Oviatt and McDougall, 1994).  Our results have implications for prior research  that draws on one, but not both, of the perspec-  tives examined here. We found a joint resource  and exchange condition effect on interfirm  cooperation. Thus, independently, the RBV and  OE each tell only part of the story. If this study  had investigated the effects of resources or  exchange conditions, any significant results would  have been of limited value because an important  explanatory variable-i.e., the interaction-would  have been left unexamined. To the extent that  our results generalize to other samples and to  related research questions, the results of prior  research having a singular focus on one perspec-  tive or the other need to be considered cautiously.  Future researchers need to recognize that when a  study is driven by one of the perspectives, find-  ings may be more robust if the other perspective  is incorporated or, at a minimum, accounted for  through the selection of control variables.  The effects of resources, exchange conditions  and interfirm cooperation on performance  Consistent with the notion that resources lay at  the center of competitive advantage, we found a  of a significant interaction effect on interfirm  cooperation, in support of Hypothesis 3, enhances  knowledge about the link between resources and  exchange conditions by demonstrating how man-  agers resolve the dilemma created when these  forces collide. Whereas resource-abundant chains  used interfirm cooperation only when cooperation  helped minimize their governance costs, low-  resource firms often cooperated regardless of their  exchange conditions, indicating that resources  take primacy over exchange conditions when con-  sidering cooperation.

Ketchen, Jr.  performance advantage for firms with well-  respected brand names when ROA was con-  sidered (Hypothesis 4a). A respected brand name  can convey competitive advantage because it  reduces uncertainty for buyers, thus making it  costly for competitors to lure buyers away (Itami,  1987). We can only speculate on why this advan-  tage did not translate into stock market perform-  ance. Perhaps any brand name effect on stock  market performance is offset by investors' prefer-  ence for the potentially high growth latent in  many not-yet-established brand names. The nega-  tive effect of age and the positive effect of growth  on market-to-book value support this reasoning.  One implication is that the importance of a parti-  cular strategic resource may vary, sometimes  unpredictably, over time (Dierickx and Cool,  1989). Thus, managers may often be aiming at a  moving target when they attempt to identify  which strategic resources deserve nurturing.  No support was found for Hypothesis 4b; top  management experience was not significantly  related to either performance measure. Although  industry observers consider top management to  be vital to superior performance (e.g., Luxenberg,  1985; Shook and Shook, 1993), experience is  apparently not alone sufficient. Future studies  might benefit from considering a broader array of  team characteristics such as composition (Priem,  1990) or reward structure (Boyd, 1994). The  significant effect of size on ROA suggests that  the potential role of economies of scale should  be accounted for in such inquiry.  Consistent with Hypothesis 5, exchange con-  ditions and chains' use of interfirm cooperation  interacted to influence performance. The relation-  ship was not as simple as predicted, however.  For firms with appropriate exchange conditions,  using interfirm cooperation to surmount resource  limitations can be lucrative; such firms performed  quite well. Thus, it is appropriate for a low-  resource firm (e.g., a start-up) to use interfirm  cooperation when exchange conditions permit.  However, those low-resource firms that attempted  to use interfirm cooperation when exchange con-  ditions pointed toward full ownership were the  worst performers in the study. This result suggests  that whereas firms may give primacy to resource  considerations when deciding whether or not to  engage in interfirm cooperation (Hypothesis 3),  they might be well advised not to. What our  results do not address, however, is whether a  low-resource firm that should, according to OE,  be using full ownership can expect any long-term  benefits from interfirm cooperation. Can these  firms use interfirm cooperation to eventually build  the resources necessary to revert to full ownership  and hence improve profitability?  Preliminary evidence indicates that the answer  may be yes; long-term benefits from using  cooperation to build resources despite unfavorable  exchange conditions appear possible. We investi-  gated the possible effects of firms' exchange  condition-interfirm cooperation posture (i.e.,  firms' categorization in Table 6) on firm perform-  ance for 1996 and 1997. For 1996, the pattern  of mean performances echoed those found for  1994-95. However, whereas the performance dif-  ferences were significant when 1996 market-to-  book values were considered (F = 3.12; p <0.05),  ROA differences were not (F = 0.18; n.s.). By  1997, no significant performance differences  could be identified (F = 2.04 for market-to-book  and F = 0.65 for ROA , both n.s.). One reason  performance differences may have deteriorated  over time may be that low-resource firms had  (1) used interfirm cooperation effectively to build  a stronger resource base, (2) improved the align-  ment between their use of interfirm cooperation  and exchange conditions, and thus (3)improved  performance. This speculation is consistent with  Shane's (1996) investigation, which found that  franchising enhances survival among (presumably  low-resource) start-ups. Our post hoc analysis is  highly tentative, however. The deterioration of  effects by 1997 could have been caused by  actions unrelated to interfirm cooperation  decisions made in 1992 and 1993. For example,  in the intervening years, low-resource firms could  have initiated cost-cutting programs or improved  their strategic decision-making processes. Thus,  additional research is needed to investigate the  interplay of interfirm cooperation, resource levels,  exchange conditions, and long-term performance  before low-resource firms can be advised to  engage in interfirm cooperation without regard to  exchange conditions.  Our results were also informative for firms that  faced few OE-based impediments to interfirm  cooperation but chose instead to emphasize full  ownership. In contrast with our expectations,  these firms were as profitable as those that fol-  lowed OE logic by emphasizing interfirm  cooperation.

The restaurant  industry is relatively stable when compared to  industries such as health care (Ketchen, Thomas,  and Snow, 1993) and airlines (Chen and Ham-  brick, 1995). In dynamic settings, uncertainty and  risk are great; thus the risk-sharing benefits of  cooperative ventures are particularly valuable  (Harrigan, 1985). Perhaps some restaurant chains  are unable to take advantage of some of the  benefits of interfirm cooperation that are prevalent  in more dynamic industries. This might also help  explain why full ownership remained popular  even among those chains that relied heavily on  interfirm cooperation. Thus, examining if industry  dynamism plays a role in the links among  exchange conditions, interfirm cooperation, and  performance would be useful. Such research  would help managers understand when alternative  organizational arrangements with differing  governance costs may nevertheless result in simi-  lar performance.  pendent or even competing perspectives, our  results show that firms do not simply respond to  the logic of only the RBV or OE, but rather  react to contingencies identified by both. These  responses have important implications for per-  formance. Our findings should encourage future  researchers to strive for a deeper understanding  of how such forces combine to influence organi-  zational action and performance.

The results of this study should be viewed in  light of its limits. Because data were drawn from  public firms in a single industry, the generaliz-  ability of our findings may be limited. Generaliza-  tions to dissimilar industries (e.g., dynamic ones)  should be viewed with caution; future research is  needed to determine if the relationships found  here hold in such settings. The number and com-  prehensiveness of the variables selected to oper-  ationalize resources and exchange conditions are  a second concern. Whereas a variety of variables  have been introduced in the literature, this study  focused on a limited set that had been strongly  linked to managerial action and performance in  prior research. Future research would benefit from  consideration of additional resources and  exchange conditions, as well as their interactions.
