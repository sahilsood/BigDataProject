This paper focuses on the utilization of guanxi, which is an important cultural and social element in China, and the impact of guanxi on ﬁrm performance. Although guanxi is embedded in every aspect of Chinese social life, companies demonstrate different needs and capacity for guanxi cultivation. Chinese ﬁrms develop guanxi as a strategic mechanism to overcome competitive and resource disadvantages by cooperating and exchanging favors with competitive forces and government authorities. We develop an integrative framework theorizing guanxi utilization according to institutional, strategic, and organizational factors, and we explore the impact of guanxi on ﬁrm performance, primarily sales growth and net profit growth. Our ﬁndings, based on a survey of 128 ﬁrms in central China, provide strong support that institutional, strategic, and organizational factors are critical determinants of guanxi with competitive forces. However, only institutional and strategic factors are signiﬁcant for guanxi utilization with government authorities. In general, guanxi leads to higher ﬁrm performance, but is limited to increased sales growth, and has little impact on profit growth. Guanxi beneﬁts market expansion and competitive positioning of ﬁrms, but does not enhance internal operations. Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Guanxi is a cultural characteristic that has strong implications for interpersonal and interorgani- zational dynamics in Chinese society. It refers to the concept of drawing on a web of connections to secure favors in personal and organizational relations. Chinese people and organizations culti- vate guanxi energetically, subtly, and imagina- tively, which governs their attitudes toward long- term social and personal relationships. Guanxi is an intricate and pervasive relational network that contains implicit mutual obligations, assurances, and understanding. It has been pervasive for cen- turies in every aspect of Chinese social and organizational activities.

It is thus critical for businesses in China, whether foreign or local, to understand and properly utilize guanxi in order to gain an edge over competitors. The practice of guanxi stems from Confucian- ism, which fostered the broad cultural aspects of collectivism manifested in the importance of networks of interpersonal relations. Guanxi has been the lifeblood of personal relationships and business conduct in Chinese society (Xin and Pearce, 1996). In the present-day fast-changing Chinese environments, guanxi has become even more entrenched with strong and direct impli- cations for social attitudes and business practices. Guanxi is a critical factor in ﬁrm performance in China, affecting the ﬂow of resources and a ﬁrm’s interaction with the task environment.

Park and Y. Luo to manage uncertainties and external important dependency. Previous studies show that guanxi affects ﬁnancial outcomes (Luo and Chen, 1996), market beneﬁts (Davies et al., 1995), and com- petitive advantages (Tsang, 1998; Yeung and Tung, 1996). Other these relationships are moderated by organizational forms (Xin and Pearce, 1996), relational demogra- phy (Farh et al., 1998), and social processes (Redding and Ng, 1982). The extent of guanxi networking is idiosyncratic to the ﬁrm, which depends on various organizational characteristics, such as strategic capabilities and orientations, size, and history (Xin and Pearce, 1996). These organizational attributes also shape the setting for interﬁrm transactions that affect the ﬁnancial and operational synergy of organizational networking (Ouchi, 1980). This study presents an integrative framework of guanxi utilization based on these ﬁrm-speciﬁc attributes and examines its impact on ﬁrm growth and internal operation. The underlying premise is that Chinese ﬁrms utilize guanxi to manage organizational interdependence and to mitigate institutional disadvantages, structural weaknesses, and other environmental threats. In particular, we focus on institutional, strategic, and organizational contexts of the ﬁrm as antecedents to guanxi networking. Our empirical ﬁndings support the proposition that the extent and effectiveness of guanxi utilization depend on such antecedents. Guanxi cannot be viewed as a panacea even in network-based Chinese society; its effective utilization depends on its ﬁt with institutional, strategic, and organizational attributes. Survey data from 128 ﬁrms across various industries in central China are employed to test hypotheses derived from this conceptual frame- work. Considering the hybrid mode of trans- actions in China, i.e., a mix of plan and market, we focus on two distinctive applications of net- working skills: horizontal connections with the task environment of suppliers, buyers, and com- petitors; and vertical connections with various levels of government and regulatory agencies. We deﬁne antecedents of guanxi according to institutional (i.e., ownership and location), stra- tegic (competitive strategy), and organizational (size, history, and resources) attributes. Following a brief description of guanxi, the next section introduces a theoretical framework that leads to hypotheses on guanxi utilization and performance. Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Confucianism is a social philosophy, CONCEPTUAL BACKGROUND Deﬁning guanxi Guanxi reﬂects delicate ﬁbers woven into every person’s social life and every aspect of Chinese society. It is deeply embedded in China’s culture, with a history of more than 5000 years. Chinese society has been functioning as a clan-like net- work since Confucius codiﬁed societal rules, values, and hierarchical structures of authority during the sixth century BC. Guanxi operates in concentric circles, with close family members at the core and with distant relatives, classmates, friends, and acquaintances arranged on the periph- ery according to the distance of the relationship and the degree of trust (Yang, 1994). When a situation arises which is beyond an individual’s capacity, the guanxi network is mobilized to accomplish desired results (Redding and Ng, 1982). rather the main concern of which is than a religion, to establish harmony in a complex society of contentious human beings through a strong and orderly hierarchy. It is based on the principle that human beings are fundamentally relation-oriented, which are predetermined and/or voluntary (Wank, 1996). In a predetermined relationship, one’s status and responsibilities within the relationship, e.g., family, dictate behavioral expectations and individual desires are heavily downplayed. On the other hand, the individual plays an active role in determining the character and tone of each exchange in an external network beyond the predetermined relationship. This is a voluntary relationship where individuals can deﬁne their own roles. in a guanxi network become complex due to the dual roles of each individual, i.e., as a passive follower of the norm in a predetermined relationship and as an initiator of voluntary relationships (Yang, 1994). stock on the importance of face (mianzi).1 Guanxi dynamics Chinese society places great Interactions 1 In China, face can be interpreted as either lian or mianzi. However, semantically, we believe only mianzi (or value of lian) is pertinent to guanxi because it represents the primary social philosophies and cultural roots of guanxi. Lian philo- sophically differentiates while mianzi socially differentiates one from others in the society. A person’s mianzi is often determined by his or her post, credibility, honesty, reputation, power, income, or network. Other things being equal, a guanxi relationship becomes stronger if one’s partner is someone with superior mianzi. Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 455–477 (2001) is a form of social capital face and the saving of others’ emphasize the enjoyment of prestige without the loss of face (Hwang, 1987). The Chinese have traditionally compared ‘losing face’ to the physical mutilation of an eye, the nose, or the mouth. Mianzi is an intangible form of social currency and personal status, which is affected by one’s social position and material wealth. It is imperative to maintain a certain level of mianzi in order to cultivate and expand a viable guanxi network (Yeung and Tung, 1996). One can also manipulate the dynam- ics within a guanxi network once one has strong mianzi. Renqing is another Chinese philosophy related to guanxi. It that provides leverage in interpersonal exchanges of favors (Yang, 1994). It represents an informal social obligation to another party as the result of invoking a guanxi relationship. It is a precon- dition to develop a guanxi network and to use the network for one’s own advantages. As Chi- nese people weave a guanxi network, they are also bound by renqing obligations (Yeung and Tung, 1996). In essence, reciprocity—an implicit ideal of the guanxi network—originates from renqing (Tsui and Farh, 1997). When one disre- gards this reciprocal obligation, he/she loses face, hurts related parties’ (i.e., friends and families) feelings, and eventually jeopardizes the guanxi network. These philosophical foundations lead to several principles that characterize the guanxi network. First, guanxi is transferable among parties (i.e., A and C) related through a common connection in the middle (i.e., B). The extent of transferability depends upon the strength of the ties of A and C to B. Second, guanxi is reciprocal. A person is viewed as untrustworthy when he/she refuses to return a favor and he/she does not follow the rules of reciprocity (Alston, 1989). In Western networks, reciprocity often entails exchanges of roughly equivalent value (Powell, 1990). But, the Chinese guanxi network often links people across uneven ranks, with the weaker party calling for special favors without an equal level of reciprocal obligation. Third, guanxi is intangible. The long- term viability of guanxi depends on the members’ commitment to the guanxi and to one another. Guanxi does not specify the range or frequency of exchanging favors. Guanxi members are tied together through an invisible and unwritten code of reciprocity and equity. Failure to respect the Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. guanxi is rather tool utilitarian 457 Guanxi and Organizational Dynamics commitment substantially hurts one’s reputation, leading to a humiliating loss of prestige or face. Finally, than emotional. It is based entirely on the exchange of favors, not an emotional attachment. Accord- ingly, the guanxi network does not necessarily involve friendship, although friendship is pre- ferred. Organization theory and strategic management literatures characterize networks as commercial and impersonal, but guanxi focuses on personal relations and the exchange of favors. Guanxi is social capital because it involves exchanges of social obligations and determines one’s face in society (Hwang, 1987; Xin and Pearce, 1996). The reciprocal exchange of favors, which is not necessarily equivalent to commercial intents and may be called upon in the future, is essential to cultivate and sustain guanxi (Redding and Ng, 1982). Guanxi thus represents a powerful force to reproduce dense regions of relationships and to maintain and accumulate the value of inherited social capital. As Coleman (1990) suggests, the rules of reciprocity in guanxi establish a structural constraint that curtails self-seeking opportunism and preserves social capital within the existing network structure. Therefore, trans- actions often follow successful guanxi, while in the West a relationship follows successful trans- actions. Guanxi is an important resource for indi- viduals and ﬁrms in China to induce cooperation and govern relationships efﬁciently. Guanxi is also a valuable entrepreneurial to bridge gaps in information and resource ﬂows between unlinked ﬁrms and between ﬁrms and important outside stakeholders. Given the uncertainty and confusion in China’s transition economy, ﬁrms develop guanxi to broker structural holes and alter the existing network structure (Burt, 1992). Firms use guanxi to mobilize complementary beneﬁts by arbitraging different networks and even potentially negotiating between competing networks. Guanxi becomes an asset at the organizational level as personal relationships are dedicated to and used by the organization. Interorganizational guanxi, called guanxi hu, is built upon and expanded through personal relationships. A viable organizational-level strong guanxi relationships among key managers in the organi- zation (Wank, 1996). As China continues its eco- nomic reform, guanxi utilization has become Strat. Mgmt.

There are substantial rewards, such as com- missions, bonuses, and promotions, for managers’ personal guanxi utilized for organizational pur- poses to source key inputs and marketing prod- ucts. In this study, we focus on ﬁrm-level guanxi that reﬂect networks among organizations, or the links between ﬁrms and the task environment or government ofﬁcials. Interﬁrm guanxi speciﬁcally refer to cross-organizational connections among managers, while guanxi with government authori- ties refer to personal relationships between ﬁrm managers and government ofﬁcials. The next sec- tion reviews the literature on interorganizational networks as it relates to Chinese guanxi. thought transfer of technical knowledge, Guanxi as interorganizational networks In recent years, networks and relationship build- for ing have become critical the success and around the world. survival of organizations are Interorganizational networks to enhance the survival and capabilities of organi- zations by providing opportunities for shared learning, legit- imacy, and resource exchange (Nohria and Eccles, 1992). Organizations connect with others to acquire new technologies and to expand their product/market reach. Studies have shown that organizational and technological competency is often at the nexus of these networks. The literature on organizational networks has grown dramatically in the last decade, based on a number of theoretical approaches. Indeed, Gala- skiewicz (1985) argues that there is no one theory of (1990) also shows that the decision to initiate relations with another organization is commonly based on multiple contingencies. Consistent with the open- systems perspective, the resource dependence or exchange models have been the dominant organi- zational rationale for interorganizational networks (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). This model suggests that organizations are dependent on their task environment for inputs that are essential for their functioning. Since organizations cannot generate all needed resources internally, they must conduct exchanges with other organizations to obtain those resources. Because such resources are often scarce and organizations tend to compete for them, the resource dependence model focuses on Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. interorganizational networks. Oliver interorganizational efforts to gain power and con- trol over essential resources, while minimizing threats to organizational autonomy (Cummings, 1984). Facing environmental turbulence, organizations are often not sure what strategic directions to follow. Sociological studies have extensively documented how ideas and know-how spread throughout a population via networks (Rogers, 1983). Firms use networks to overcome the uncer- tainty and distrust that plague economic trans- actions (Galaskiewicz and Wasserman, 1989). According to the sociological view, ﬁrms adopt networks as a mechanism to mimic successful ﬁrms’ strategies under conditions of uncertainty. Galaskiewicz and Wasserman (1989: 456) argue that ‘organizational decision makers see how other organizations cope with environmental con- ditions similar to their own and thus get some idea as to how to behave themselves.’ Organiza- tional decisions thus reﬂect the result of interﬁrm contagion within a network (DiMaggio and Pow- ell, 1983). Organizations avoid uncertainty and enhance social legitimacy by mimicking others in the network. The social problem-solving perspective sug- gests that when the larger social ﬁeld within which embedded becomes more complex and turbulent, organi- zations encounter problems and areas of uncer- tainty with which they cannot alone (Cummings, 1984). In general, open-system mod- els predict that exchanges occur when two or more organizations perceive mutual beneﬁts from interacting, such as gaining necessary resources (or legitimacy) or negotiating a more stable com- petitive order. Under the institutional perspective, organizations experience pressure to conform to common understandings of effective and efﬁcient structure resource-based approach views legitimacy as a resource for organizations to obtain and exchange material resources. However, the institutional perspective argues that organizations gain legitimacy for their operations through isomorphism with the environ- ment, i.e., by conforming to commonly accepted structures and procedures (Goes and Park, 1997). Guanxi networks expand information and resource access by widening the sweep of environmental scanning of an organization and by linking com- plementary assets in other organizations. In contrast, economic studies view the organi- Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 455–477 (2001) behavior. The organizations relevant are cope and and technological zational network as a connecting and transferring mechanism of complementary and interdependent competencies between ﬁrms. Teece (1986) em- phasizes the importance of networks due to the wide dispersion and strong interdependency of organizational competence across ﬁrms. The transaction cost theory portrays networks as an intermediate form of governance between market and hierarchy, i.e., a speciﬁc type of bilateral governance based on transactional reciprocity. The long-term reciprocity in a net- work is an attribute of hierarchy, but networks also maintain the beneﬁt of market efﬁciency that ﬂows from scale and scope economies (Goes and Park, 1997). China’s recent economic transition has produced a high degree of institutional uncer- tainty (Nee, 1992). Accordingly, transaction costs remain high for ﬁrms to secure necessary inputs and legitimize their existence. As institutional uncertainty increases, ﬁrms more eagerly turn to guanxi networks to lower external dependence for key resources and to improve their legitimacy. Thus, a guanxi network helps a ﬁrm overcome the lack of resources to accommodate growth while alleviating substantial bureaucratic costs that would result from internalizing operations. Furthermore, in China there is a substantial insti- tutional hurdle in transferring ownership, creating further needs for sharing through the guanxi net- work (Boisot and Child, 1988; Peng and Heath, 1996). As a loosely structured network, guanxi is an efﬁcient mechanism to facilitate economic exchanges and to overcome administrative inter- ventions by the Chinese government. Studies have indicated that a primary concern of Chinese man- agers and organizations is to engage in extensive networking activities through guanxi and various informal agreements to build trust and exchange favors (Kao, 1993; Tsui and Farh, 1997). Others have argued that organizational net- works generate beneﬁts through synergy and (Thorelli, 1986). Net- expanded market power works provide member organizations greater access to human and ﬁnancial resources, knowl- edge, and management expertise (Oliver, 1990). In a collaborative relationship, member organi- zations can be conceptualized as chains of distinc- tive components. By specializing in areas of core competence, while expanding the scope of the overall production function to encompass the competence of partner ﬁrms, each organization can achieve economies of scope through a recon- Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 459 Guanxi and Organizational Dynamics ﬁgured value chain (Miles and Snow, 1984). By linking together, organizations expand their prod- uct and market reach and exercise greater market power than freestanding competitors. As market information is greatly distorted in a transition economy, the guanxi network becomes a reliable source of necessary information for the making of strategic decisions. Adopters of network strategies may also enjoy an ‘early ﬁt’ (Miles and Snow, 1984), providing opportunities to exercise greater political inﬂuence, establish standards of legit- imacy, control valuable information, or broker new cooperative arrangements. Smaller or newer organizations can overcome legitimacy barriers through involvement thus gaining wider opportunities to inﬂuence the local, political, and/or regulatory environments. in guanxi networks, stability, depends efﬁciency, utilization HYPOTHESES The network literature addresses the diverse moti- vations for network creation, primarily the eco- nomic, social, political, and institutional factors. In a comprehensive review, Oliver (1990) iden- tiﬁes six organization-speciﬁc contingencies that are generalizable determinants of networking among organizations: necessity, asymmetry, reci- and legitimacy. procity, Guanxi institutional, on organizational, and strategic contexts unique to a ﬁrm. The intensity and nature of the guanxi depend on each ﬁrm’s idiosyncratic organizational and institutional attributes. Managers and ﬁrms seek out organizational connections and cultivate personal relationships to meet speciﬁc needs for resources, political protection, or legitimacy, which otherwise would be unavailable (Nee, 1992). Given the lack of a stable legal and regula- tory environment, such connections are critical to managers and organizations in China to facilitate impersonal business activities (Alston, 1989). In particular, organizations in China receive different treatment and resource allocations from the government depending on their institutional and organizational orientations, such as ownership, size, experience, and skills. Therefore, there is a great deal of variation across Chinese ﬁrms in terms of their institutional advantages and disad- vantages (Nee, 1992). These organizational vari- ations are sustained because they are deeply embedded in the social, institutional, economic, Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 455–477 (2001) skills, and strategic vulnerability, S. H. Park and Y. Luo 460 and political systems (Perkins, 1994). Firms are also idiosyncratic in their ability to scan information, handle information uncer- tainties, and beneﬁt from information exchanges (Tung, 1979). They thus have different levels of need and different capacities to utilize and sustain the guanxi network. Although guanxi is embedded in intricate and informal personal relationships, interpartner complementarity in terms of strategic needs, organizational and competitive strengths is still a necessary condition to cultivate and sustain the guanxi network. Network com- plementarity depends on the speciﬁc organizational traits of the member companies. The resource- based view posits that ﬁrms are heterogeneous with respect to their resource/capability endow- ments (Barney, 1991). Further, resource endow- ments are sticky over any strategically relevant time frame. Therefore, ﬁrms with heterogeneous and sticky resources/capabilities perceive differen- tial opportunities and needs for the guanxi net- work. The mix of skills, knowledge, resources, environmental institutional legitimacy depends on each member’s organi- zational and institutional attributes (Shenkar and Von Glinow, 1994). Firm-speciﬁc settings thus determine the level of guanxi utilization and its inﬂuence on performance. In the following sec- tion, we characterize organizational attributes according to institutional, strategic, and organi- zational factors as antecedents to guanxi utili- zation. In particular, we focus on the ownership structure, orientations, resources, size, and history of Chinese ﬁrms. The paper delineates the guanxi network in terms of connections with the task environment and government ofﬁcials that are two distinctive applications of networking skills in China. The guanxi network in China is the lifeblood of the business community and of the institutional con- text (Kao, 1993). Therefore, guanxi operates not only horizontally with other organizations in the task environment, such as suppliers, buyers, and competitors, but also vertically with various levels of government and regulatory authorities (Luo and Chen, 1996). In the absence of clear property rights, the extent of guanxi often affects decision making of government ofﬁcials, who thus exercise personal preferences legal interpretations of rules. Instead of subscribing to the abstract notion of impartial justice, organi- zations may rely on personal contacts with Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. location, in lieu of strict the economic control, things done. For government ofﬁcials to get example, scarce resources are allocated according to guanxi rather than based on bureaucratic rules. reform to ongoing Despite decentralize government central the government still controls resource distribution, investment size, industry structure, bank loans, and business formation in strategic sectors. Busi- ness activities still depend to a large extent on administrative interference rather than on the mar- ket mechanism (Rawski, 1994). Accordingly, government ofﬁcials maintain power to ratify projects, allocate resources and materials, arrange ﬁnancing and distribution, and provide access to infrastructure. Firms strive to reduce their quotas speciﬁed in government contracts to generate extra profits by selling excess supplies in the market. Firms attempt to secure supplies of key inputs through government channels at lower costs. Guanxi with ofﬁcials also offers protection against environmental uncertainties (Child, 1994). Institutional factors Ownership structure Institutions regulate economic activities through formal and informal constraints and by setting the rules of the game as a basis for production, exchange, and distribution (North, 1990). Eco- nomic activities are shaped within the institutional framework because such a framework dictates which organizational actions are accepted and supported (Aldrich and Fiol, 1994). Human and organizational interactions take place within the institutional framework. Accordingly, the insti- tutional framework places constraints on the ﬁrms’ strategic choices (Peng and Heath, 1996). Firms also react differently in adapting to insti- tutional pressures (Oliver, 1991). In China’s tran- sition economy, impacts are mani- fested in ownership structure and location of the ﬁrm. Despite ongoing attempts to facilitate market transactions, China’s economic reform remains incomplete, with a mix of both plan and market systems operating in the economy. There is a great deal of ambiguity regarding property rights and production factor markets are inoperative, which is why the survival of ﬁrms largely depends on their networking with local govern- ments. Private ﬁrms have grown quickly, while Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 455–477 (2001) institutional control of ﬁnancing and key scarce resources largely remain with the state. Until the early 1980s allocations for private ﬁrms were restricted. The ambiguity of property rights has generated a new form of opportunism among entrepreneurs and state and local governments. At least until the early 1980s, state or local governments main- tained full control over the redistribution of capi- tal and important raw materials. Private ﬁrms had to compete with state-owned ﬁrms for scarce resources. It is not surprising to ﬁnd that private ﬁrms were often left out of business opportunities due to a lack of materials even if their products were popular in the market. They lacked legit- imacy and political backing to secure access to capital, which forced them to turn to private resources and to pay much higher rates (Nee, 1992). Private ﬁrms also faced a great deal of political uncertainty. Their survival depended on the unreliable market rules of the game set by the government. Given such institutional uncertainty, private ﬁrms nurture reciprocal relationship with local governments through vari- ous formal and informal ties (i.e., guanxi) to economize on transaction costs. Guanxi with local governments also helps ﬁrm settle negotiation deals (Pye, 1995). China’s transformation has thus given rise to a distinctive institutional form, called ‘network capitalism’ (Boisot and Child, 1996). As the number of nonstate-owned ﬁrms exploded during the 1980s, state-owned ﬁrms started prac- ticing a ‘contractual liability lever’ in their man- agement and reward systems (Yeung and Tung, 1996). Facing ineffective factor markets and ambiguous property rights, the guanxi network substitutes for formal resource allocation and dispersal. channels of Thus, we hypothesize: government-instituted, a long-term-based Hypothesis 1: Nonstate-owned ﬁrms are more likely to form guanxi than state-owned ﬁrms. Location Favorable location becomes a source of competi- tive advantage for incumbents if they can acquire the location at a price less than its true value (Barney, 1996). During the economic reform in the 1980s, the Chinese government set up special economic zones to lure foreign direct investment (Park, Li, and Tse, 1997). These areas offer Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 461 Guanxi and Organizational Dynamics various beneﬁts, like low-cost labor, tax exemp- tions, and duty-free importation of raw materials and technology. Infrastructure support and invest- ment incentives in these areas allow for lower operating risks and higher efﬁciency and returns. As centers of market-oriented growth leading to strong competitive incentives, they are attractive host locations for foreign ﬁrms. For these reasons, there are wide variations in the level of economic development and the stage of economic reform across regions, especially between the open and nonopen economic regions. Accordingly, these regions reﬂect differences in cultural environments, business atmosphere, and government policies. Open areas, such as the special economic zones, generally maintain more Western-style business facilities and a Western cultural atmosphere. Therefore, organizations in open areas tend to rely on arm’s-length relation- ships for transactions more than those in nonopen regions due to enhanced market competition among organizations (Punnett and Yu, 1990). On the other hand, nonopen regions experience much lower levels of interﬁrm competition and reﬂect much stronger collectivistic traditions than open regions. In nonopen regions, ﬁrms maintain a much stronger tendency to collaborate with other ﬁrms and with government ofﬁcials to overcome potential disadvantages of competing with those in open regions. Due to less preferential treatment from the government, taxation, ﬁnancing, and resource allocation, ﬁrms in non- open regions are pressed to rely more on guanxi connections to compensate for such constraints and disadvantages in the institutional environ- ment. This leads to: in terms of Hypothesis 2: Firms in less open economic regions are more likely to develop guanxi net- works with the business community and government authorities. Strategic orientation The strategy ﬁeld presents numerous classiﬁcation schemes to illustrate the dimensions of business strategies. The conﬁguration approach charac- terizes ﬁrms according to various sets of organi- zational and strategic orientations. There are sev- eral typologies, such as those of Miles and Snow (1978), Porter (1985), and Miller and Friesen (1983), representing the conﬁguration approach. Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 455–477 (2001) S. H. Park and Y. Luo 462 These strategic conﬁgurations all focus on a busi- ness’s relative emphasis on market effectiveness vs. operational efﬁciency. For example, the Miles and Snow framework distinguishes three distinc- tive types of business strategies, i.e., Defenders, Prospectors, and Analyzers, while Porter focuses on Overall Cost Leadership and Differentiation according to a ﬁrm’s relative focus on market effectiveness and operational efﬁciency. The strategic orientation toward market effec- tiveness (e.g., Prospector or Differentiation) con- tinually searches for market opportunities and experiments with emerging trends and technol- ogies. Firms following the market-oriented strat- egy concentrate on scanning, identifying, and capitalizing on emerging market opportunities and value being ‘ﬁrst’ in new product and market areas. They also bear high costs and risks in maintaining extensive and ﬂexible capabilities to respond to institutional and economic changes in a given market. Managers in market-oriented ﬁrms choose from a wide variety of options and emphasize exploring novel ideas and strategies to respond rapidly to early signals of opportunity in dynamic markets. Therefore, market-oriented ﬁrms face a much greater probability of failure and a higher level of outcome uncertainty as they explore new options (Rajagopalan, 1997). In sum, the market-oriented strategy reﬂects the avail- ability of multiple options, low behavior pro- grammability, high cause–effect ambiguity, and outcome uncertainty. Market-oriented ﬁrms may thus have higher needs for guanxi networks to mitigate the uncertainty and risk posed by their innovative and aggressive strategic orientation. They also emphasize communicating with local markets and spanning boundaries to accommodate dynamic changes and needs for expansion as they strive to identify and capitalize on emerging market opportunities (Venkatraman and Prescott, 1990). The higher level of uncertainty in the transition induces market- oriented ﬁrms to seek guanxi to deal with com- petitive forces in the task environment and with government ofﬁcials. Market-oriented ﬁrms can minimize uncertainties and secure necessary inputs through a guanxi network. the efﬁciency-oriented strategy (e.g., Defender or Overall Cost Leadership) is rigid, short-sighted, nonadaptive, and risk-averse. Efﬁciency-oriented ﬁrms tend to focus on increas- ing the efﬁciency of existing operations through Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. In contrast, economy further they tend to efﬁciency, improvements. These ﬁrms often continual develop cost-efﬁcient single core technologies and seldom adjust their internal orientations. While the market-oriented strategy enacts dynamic environments and builds the prime capability to ﬁnd and exploit new product and market oppor- tunities, the efﬁciency-oriented strategy strives to serve stable and narrowly deﬁned products or market domains efﬁciently (Miles and Snow, 1978). As efﬁciency-oriented ﬁrms emphasize operational ignore environmental changes that have little impact on their current operations. This type of strategic orientation is basically an internally oriented approach that pays little attention to external changes or opportunities. Overall, the efﬁciency- oriented strategy reﬂects restricted managerial options, more emphasis on historical precedents and programmability, less cause–effect ambiguity, and uncertainty (Rajagopalan, 1997). Therefore, these ﬁrms have little need for guanxi and network building with external government ofﬁcials. Moreover, during the recent economic transition guanxi cultivation has become very costly, such as in the paying of ‘management fees’ to government ofﬁcials to secure political protection and reliable access to scarce resources. This further discourages efﬁciency-oriented ﬁrms from pursuing guanxi. This leads to: competitive outcome forces less risk and or Hypothesis 3: Firms are more likely to utilize a guanxi network as their emphasis on a market- oriented strategy increases. Organizational factors Size Firm size is an important attribute that shapes behaviors and decisions in a ﬁrm (Nadler and Tushman, 1988). As size increases, so do the bureaucratic structures, thus making it difﬁcult to have a personal, entrepreneurial style of man- agement. Shan and Hamilton (1991) present empirical evidence to show that small ﬁrms are more likely to cooperate with other ﬁrms than large ﬁrms. Small ﬁrms look for external support to enhance environmental scanning and to over- come the lack of key resources and technologies. Managers in large organizations are less inclined to adopt participative managerial attitudes, while Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 455–477 (2001) In general, those in smaller organizations are more ﬂexible in decision making. size affects organizational culture, ownership structure, and agency relationships (Aldrich, 1979). Size also affects a ﬁrm’s capability to handle the task environment. Large ﬁrms have more favorable access to capital. Hall and Weiss (1967) show a positive relationship between absolute ﬁrm size and profitability due to enhanced scale and scope efﬁciencies. In China, most large ﬁrms are descendants of the old planning system. Prior to the reform, it was the state that determined the scale of a ﬁrm. Size had a direct link with management perks and status and there was a precise correspondence between size and the government hierarchy. In addition to the lack of support from the govern- ment, small ﬁrms in China also had little bar- gaining power with the government, subjecting them to frequent government intervention and hindrance (Perkins, 1994). On the other hand, large ﬁrms lack competitive and entrepreneurial mindsets because most of them are under govern- ment protection. Large ﬁrms in China thus have few incentives to cultivate guanxi with competi- tive forces in the task environment or with government ofﬁcials. Xin and Pearce (1996) assert that small ﬁrms in China stress the impor- tance of personal and organizational connections with external stakeholders to counteract their lia- bilities due to size. Establishing guanxi with government ofﬁcials is critical for the survival and growth of small ﬁrms in China, allowing them to overcome institutional disadvantages. The population ecology literature addresses the direct negative relationship between size (and age) and organizational survival due to the lack of external ties and legitimacy (Freeman, Carroll, and Hannan, 1983). Organizational survival and performance thus improve as a ﬁrm becomes larger (Singh, Tucker, and House, 1986). Guanxi networks are a primary mechanism for small ﬁrms in China to overcome the liability of their size disadvantages. Although small ﬁrms do not have the necessary organizational capabilities to compete with large ﬁrms, they have strategic and operational ﬂexi- bility. Their entrepreneurial spirit allows them to cultivate guanxi networks easily and to offset their institutional and competitive disadvantages. In sum, while small ﬁrms have more critical needs for external buffers, their size allows them Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. competitive other and Guanxi and Organizational Dynamics more ﬂexibility to cultivate guanxi. Therefore: 463 Hypothesis 4: Small organizations are more likely to utilize guanxi networks than are large organizations in China. fast economic development Resources The resource-based view posits that sustainable competitive advantage stems from valuable, rare, and inimitable resources that ﬁrms develop over time (Barney, 1991). Technological skills and managerial capabilities are particularly relevant for guanxi development in Chinese ﬁrms. Techno- logical skills are important for organizational competence (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990). They allow for the development of new products and processes and for the potential to adapt to chang- ing market dynamics. The resource dependence framework suggests a lower level of external dependence for ﬁrms with superior resources and capabilities. This implies that ﬁrms have fewer needs for guanxi networks as their technological skills improve. In a transition economy, superior skills also allow ﬁrms to have strong bargaining power with the government, whose primary goal is (Child, 1994). Firms with superior technological skills thus have little need for connections with government ofﬁcials and regulatory agencies. the building of guanxi represents an overinvestment for such ﬁrms. Instead of external networking, Prahalad and Hamel (1990) indicate that ﬁrms with superior technological skills tend to maintain a higher inter- dependence. Internal networking improves scope- based economic gains by leveraging the skills across its own business units while preventing potential leakage of capabilities to competitors. On the other hand, ﬁrms in China with poor technological skills utilize guanxi as a competitive instrument to overcome their competitive disad- vantages by securing deals from suppliers, orders from buyers, and approvals from the government (Shenkar, 1996). Given inoperative factor markets and ambiguous property rights, the guanxi net- work is an economically and culturally viable mechanism to offset technological disadvantages. Thus, we hypothesize: technological level of In fact, internal Hypothesis 5: Firms with poor technological skills are more likely to utilize guanxi networks Strat. Mgmt.

Managerial for building organizational competence; to imitate because they are scarce, specialized, and tacitly embedded within the ﬁrm (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993). As the transition toward the market system continues, there is an increasing need for such managerial capabilities even though they are still rare resources in China. Managerial skills are embedded in complex social systems involving various social and cognitive processes that are not yet well understood (Barney, 1991). Due to their speciﬁcity, managerial skills are difﬁcult to transfer to other organizations or to imitate; thus they bestow considerable competi- tive advantages on a ﬁrm. Given that the guanxi network is a substitute for competitive disadvan- tages, Chinese ﬁrms with superior managerial capabilities may have relatively fewer reasons to resort to a guanxi network. Previous studies report that Chinese ﬁrms lacking managerial skills tend to pursue more guanxi-based business strategies, such as sales force marketing and credit liberaliz- ation in purchasing. In China, direct personnel marketing is primarily a reﬂection of guanxi con- tacts. Sellers try not to embarrass customers who are temporarily unable to pay in a culture where guanxi is painstakingly nurtured and harmony is a high priority. On the other hand, organizations with strong managerial capabilities tend to pursue guanxi-free business strategies, such as advertis- ing, internal R&D, pricing, and/or product/service quality. This leads to: Hypothesis 6: Organizations with poor mana- gerial capabilities are more likely to utilize the guanxi network than those with strong managerial capabilities. Length of operations Organizational history is also an important deter- minant of legitimacy, strategic behaviors, and guanxi cultivation. History shapes the organi- zational culture by affecting values and beliefs that have developed over time. Organizational age reﬂects institutionalized managerial attitudes and beliefs (Baker and Cullen, 1994). The population ecology theory assumes that inertia is a prevailing property of organizational evolution and, conse- quently, organizations retain basic attributes of Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. their early forms (Freeman et al., 1983). Young organizations are subject to the liability of new- ness because routines are rarely perfected and stabilized, organizational politics are unstable, and links with key actors in the environment are irregular. It takes time for an organization to acquire institutional legitimacy among its mem- bers and to become valued in its own right. On the other hand, older organizations are highly entrenched with bureaucratic rules and systems, and lack entrepreneurial values to adapt dynami- cally to environmental changes. New organizations, therefore, need to be more proactive and aggressive in searching for external resources that are essential for their survival and growth. Young organizations in China, partic- ularly those formed during the recent economic reform, are more entrepreneurial than are older organizations; they are primarily based on market- based incentive systems and follow tight budget constraints (Park et al., 1997). These organi- zations are more ﬂexible in choosing the right modes of operations to adapt to market needs, and their main goal is maximizing profits instead of serving society, which is the goal of the older, state-owned ﬁrms. Therefore, we expect stronger and more active guanxi utilization by newer organizations in China to compensate for their lack of legitimacy and competitive resources. Guanxi also provides newer ﬁrms with risk- reducing capabilities. This leads to: Hypothesis 7: Newer ﬁrms are more likely to utilize guanxi networks than older ﬁrms. Guanxi and ﬁrm performance In the network literature, there is ample empirical evidence that interorganizational ties improve per- formance for the whole group (Van de Ven and Walker, 1984). Based on several case studies of hospital networks, Thomas and Trevino (1993) show that networks are able to improve perfor- mance by reducing uncertainties and equivocality in decision making through proper information- processing mechanisms. Unlike studies that focus on collective performance at the network level, several recent studies explore the impact of net- works on individual ﬁrms (Goes and Park, 1997; Pennings and Harianto, 1992). Sociological focus on studies of networks organizational isomorphism, mortality, and sur- Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 455–477 (2001) (Miner, Amburgey, and Stearns, 1990). vival They suggest organizational ties buffer ﬁrms from failure and provide survival advantages, even under intense levels of competition or during organizational transformation. Several recent stud- ies in the strategy literature have addressed the impact of organizational ties on ﬁrm-level stra- tegic decisions and outcomes, such as service development or innovation. Pennings and Hari- anto (1992) present strong evidence supporting the enhanced adoption of innovations among net- worked banks. Goes and Park (1997) also show wide diffusion of service innovations among hos- pitals tied together through direct and indirect networks, by facilitating the sharing of infor- mation, resources, and managerial capabilities. Miles and Snow (1984) imply that cooperating ﬁrms also beneﬁt from political inﬂuence, con- trolling information, and brokering new coopera- tive arrangements. The guanxi network is more than merely a symbolic representation of personal and organizational ties. It is a utilitarian mech- anism whereby resource exchanges occur inde- pendently of the active, conscious participation of the organizations and individuals involved. As posited by resource dependence theory, resource transactions among guanxi members show the degree of inﬂuence on organizational decisions shared by cooperating ﬁrms. As organizations continue their interactions with other ﬁrms and government ofﬁcials through the guanxi network, there is a deliberate and unintended diffusion of information and accumulation of resources and capabilities. Cooperative ﬁrms in the guanxi net- work basically serve as resources to one another, contributing toward enhanced survival and growth through both planned and unplanned exchanges of personnel, market information, money, facili- ties, or political favors. Goes and Park (1997) argue that these exchanges encapsulate technical learning and competence that enable innovative capabilities to cross actively among network ﬁrms. impact on the market expansion and sales growth of Chinese ﬁrms by affecting resource sharing and social, economic, and political contexts in interﬁrm transactions (Kao, 1993). Managers devote time and effort to develop interpersonal guanxi that contribute to the sales growth of their organizations and to their personal ﬁnancial gains and career promotions. Guanxi with buyers may spur customer loyalty Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Guanxi has a direct rather resource than bureaucratic rulings. 465 Guanxi and Organizational Dynamics and increase sales by minimizing transaction costs and business uncertainties. Guanxi with suppliers help the ﬁrm to acquire quality materials, and to receive good service and timely deliveries. Also, guanxi with competitors facilitates possible inter- ﬁrm collaboration for sharing and implicit collusion, which help mitigate competi- tive costs and operational variability. Overall, guanxi networks with competitive forces in the task environment help Chinese ﬁrms boost sales and growth. there Given the legal uncertainties in China, are also practical beneﬁts to be derived from rules personal connections and loyalties. Most and regulations are still ambiguous and their enforcement is subject to the personal interpre- tations of government ofﬁcials. Scarce resources are allocated primarily according to guanxi relations In essence, guanxi facilitates business dealings while the formal bureaucratic rules often inhibit them (Alston, 1989). Guanxi establishes a balance in the cumbersome Chinese bureaucracy by com- plementing ambiguous bureaucratic rules with personal relations. Chinese ﬁrms can circumvent bureaucratic hurdles through personal networks. This makes guanxi vital for the performance and survival of Chinese ﬁrms. Although guanxi is based on personal relations and exchanges of favors, it also entails obligations and costs, i.e., renqing, to the beneﬁciaries (Yang, 1994). Guanxi and utilitarian, whereby favors imply obligations or liabilities that must be repaid at some point. This is essen- tial in the managing of guanxi because the absence of reciprocity seriously affects one’s social status or In sum, cultivating and sustaining guanxi can be costly in terms of the reciprocal and utilitarian demands despite the con- tribution to sales growth. The obligation to per- sonal attachments and ties sometimes obstructs business changes that are necessary to improve ﬁrm profit (Seabright, Levinthal, and Fichman, 1992). As a result, guanxi networks do not neces- sarily contribute to profit growth. This problem is aggravated during economic reform and periods of structural adjustment because guanxi culti- vation requires a large amount of monetary investments. This leads to: is reciprocal face.

Luo effect on profit growth. old central the planning METHOD Sample This study took place in the People’s Republic of China between 1996 and 1997. China ofﬁcially opened its doors to foreign investment in 1979. Two years after Mao Zedong died, the Commu- nist Party held the historic Third Plenum of the Eleventh Party Congress in December 1978, embarking on far-reaching economic reforms, which evolved into the transition from planned to market economy. The ultimate goal of the transition is to build a market economy that can deliver long-term growth in living standards while shedding system. Speciﬁcally, the transition encompasses three sets of reforms: the freeing of prices, trade, and entry to markets; the clarifying of property rights and privatization where necessary; and the reshaping of social services and the social safety net to ease the pain of transition while propelling the process forward (World Bank, 1996). The data set includes companies from multiple industries located in central China, i.e., Shanghai and Jiangsu.2 Between 1996 and 1997 we mailed a survey to high-level managers, such as general managers or deputy general managers. The initial questionnaire followed earlier studies (e.g., Tan and Litschert, 1994; Xin and Pearce, 1996) and was based on our extensive ﬁeldwork in these areas. We also asked experts on Chinese business, two management professors in Nanjing University and one business scholar in Shanghai’s Fudan University, to review our Chinese questionnaire translated from the original English version, which was then revised and subject to a back- translation procedure to ensure validity in a cross- cultural setting. Consultation was also sought on instrument development and in ﬁnalizing the draft to ensure the validity of the survey. Prior to the survey, we conducted an informal test to conﬁrm the face and construct validity of the items on the questionnaire with 27 managers from 20 organizations in the Nanjing area. In our personal interviews, we asked them to describe their own interpretations of guanxi and the type of strategies 2 Shanghai is the most cosmopolitan city in China, and Jiangsu is a province where Shanghai is located. Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. that are built on guanxi. The results reveal a high level of correspondence between managers’ perceptions and the descriptions of guanxi in the literature, mitigating our concern about common method variance. In particular, the results indicate more than 90 percent of the managers view sales force marketing and the granting of credit as business practices that are most reliant on guanxi. This result is highly consistent with the ﬁndings of Luo and Chen (1996). We sent out the Chinese questionnaire to 400 randomly selected companies from 22,000 busi- nesses listed in 22,000 Businesses in the P.R.C. in various counties and cities in Shanghai and areas of Jiangsu through an independent contrac- tor. After two rounds of reminders, we had 128 usable responses with complete information, rep- resenting a 32 percent response rate. We com- pared the mean values of the number of employees, net profit/employee, sales/employee, and length of operation from two samples of respondents and nonrespondents with the industry means as reported in the China Statistical Year- book to check for any systematic bias between the two groups. We identiﬁed the information for the nonrespondents from the 1996 edition of 22,000 Businesses in the P.R.C. According to t- tests, both samples were not signiﬁcantly differ- ent, at p < 0.1, from the population mean. The Kolmogorow–Smirnov D value was also insig- niﬁcant, which indicates a similar distribution for both samples. These tests led us to conclude that there was no signiﬁcant nonresponse bias in our sample. For the variables with multiple indicators (e.g., strategic orientation and guanxi), we tested internal consistency using Spearman–Brown R values. These values ranged between 0.78 and 0.94, indicating an adequate level of internal con- sistency. Measures and analysis In the questionnaire, the ownership structure was deﬁned by three groups—state-owned, collec- tively owned, and privately owned—according to the ofﬁcial classiﬁcation by the Chinese govern- ment. In operationalizing the variable, we com- bined the private and the collective-owned ﬁrms into a group. It has been indicated that collective- owned ﬁrms operate like private-owned ﬁrms and, as nonstated-owned ﬁrms, both types of ﬁrms are much more institutionally independent than state- Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 455–477 (2001) Nanjing, owned ﬁrms (Nee, 1992).3 A dummy variable represented ownership structure, with 1 for non- state-owned ﬁrms, including both collective and private ﬁrms; otherwise, 0 for state-owned ﬁrms. We also created a dummy variable with 1 for nonopen cities and 0 for open cities. Open regions are those areas that the central government has opened to the outside world. In our sample, open cities Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Nantong, Lianyuangan, and Shang- hai. Strategic orientation (i.e., the level of market effectiveness) represents the mean of a multi- dimensional construct that includes questions of innovativeness, adaptability, and proactiveness. Responses for these items were on a 7-point Likert scale (see Appendix). We used total assets for ﬁrm size and the number of years operating in China for age. Resource strength (i.e., techno- logical and managerial skills) was measured by managers’ perception of these skills vis-a`-vis their major competitors in the industry. Previous stud- ies show a strong correlation between subjective assessment vis-a`-vis competitors and objective measures of ﬁrm resource strength (Chandler and Hanks, 1993). Studies have also shown that it is particularly desirable to apply subjective measures to study organizational capabilities. The survey includes a one-paragraph deﬁnition of guanxi to avoid confusion among respondents. Guanxi with the business community and with the government authorities constitute a multifaceted construct. The former consists of horizontal connections with buyers, suppliers, and competitors, while the latter includes political governments, industrial departments, and other regulatory authorities such as taxation bureaus, banks, and commercial administration bureaus. Responses were based on a 7-point Likert scale and we used the mean of these constructs for each application of networking. We deﬁned per- formance according to ﬁnancial measures during the most recent 3 years, i.e., net profit growth that speciﬁes its construct connections with include vertical In a recent study, Park et al. 467 Guanxi and Organizational Dynamics and sales growth (market expansion), both of which are widely used in studies of Chinese businesses (Tan and Litschert, 1994). We included a composite indicator and a dummy variable to control for industry and other external effects on guanxi utilization and ﬁrm performance. Guanxi utilization may differ across industries depending on the nature of the busi- nesses and the extent of market competition and uncertainties. Industrial organization literature indicates that ﬁrm performance depends to a large extent on industry structure, such as entry bar- riers, concentration, differentiation, and growth rate. (1997) presented empirical evidence to show that indus- try structural variables have a substantial impact on ﬁrm performance in China. These variables affect ﬁrm behavior, market power, and resource allocation within an industry, generating different contexts for guanxi utilization and ﬁrm perfor- mance. For example, companies in fast-growing and less competitive industries may not have much need for guanxi development, as the environment is already favorable for superior per- formance. On the other hand, ﬁrms in a competi- tive industry may need to focus on guanxi devel- opment to foster their positions in the market and overcome market uncertainties. We controlled for the industry effect by utilizing a dummy variable to distinguish between manufacturing and service industries and a composite growth index for each industry at level as deﬁned by the State Statistical Bureau. The dummy variable is coded 1 for manufacturing industries; 0 otherwise. The index reﬂects multiple aspects of the industry structure, including the number of enterprises, net output value of the industry, sales revenue, net value of ﬁxed assets, total after-tax profits, and total operating income. We determine the com- pound growth rates of these variables according to the ﬁgures in the China Statistical Yearbooks for 1992–95, which are then used in the following formula to calculate the growth index: the 2-digit GIj =⌺{((1 + rijt1)(1 + rijt2) (1 + rijt3))1/3 ⫺1}/6 3 Many collective-owned ﬁrms, e.g., township and village enterprises, are in fact de facto private enterprises. They register as collective-owned ﬁrms because of special beneﬁts such as low taxation, easier access to bank loans, and other support from local government. Our empirical testing also reveals no substantial difference between these two groups as they are entered separately into the model. The text has been rewritten for clariﬁcation on this issue.

Luo 468 Hypotheses 1–7 for guanxi with the business community and with government authorities, respectively. We adopted a hierarchical procedure to test the relative impact of each construct of the variables; Models 1a, 1b, and 1c (Models 2a, 2b, and 2c) are compared with the base model, which includes only control variables for horizon- tal (vertical) networks with business community (government authorities). Models 3 (3a, 3b, and 3c) and 4 (4a, 4b, and 4c) test Hypothesis 8 on sales growth and profit growth, respectively; we include the antecedent variables on guanxi utili- zation as control variables. Along with the indus- try, these variables also affect ﬁrm performance (Grant, 1996). Variance inﬂation factors (VIF) in all regression models indicate no signiﬁcant sign of a multicollinearity problem. VIF values range from 1.22 to 1.97 for Models 1 and 2 and from 1.28 to 2.10 for Models 3 and 4. RESULTS Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation coefﬁcients for the study vari- ables. The correlation matrix indicates consis- tently signiﬁcant correlation between the ante- cedent variables and the guanxi network with the business community. Except for the length of operations, every independent variable is signiﬁ- cantly correlated with guanxi with the business community. However, only institutional factors (i.e., ownership structure and location) and stra- tegic orientation are signiﬁcantly correlated with the guanxi network with government authorities. None of the organizational factors were signiﬁ- cantly correlated with guanxi with government authorities. The two applications of networking skill appear to be closely related to one another, indicating that as companies build external net- works, they do so both with forces in the task environment and with institutional authorities. Table 1 also supports Hypothesis 8, with a strong correlation between guanxi and ﬁrm performance. Guanxi appears to be more strongly related to sales growth than to improvements in net profit. Table 2 presents regression results for Models 1 and 2 that test Hypotheses 1–7 on guanxi antecedents. Models 1a, 1b, and 1c were all signiﬁcant at p < 0.05, supporting institutional, strategic, as important antecedents for guanxi development Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. organizational and constructs with the business community. For guanxi with government authorities, organizational factors in general, i.e., Model 2c, were not signiﬁcant at p < 0.1 while offering strong support for institutional factors and strategic orientation, with signiﬁcant results at p < 0.05 for Models 2a and 2b. Institutional factors (i.e., ownership structure and location) were consistently signiﬁcant for both horizontally and vertically applied guanxi at p < 0.1, supporting Hypotheses 1 and 2. Owner- ship structure showed a stronger relationship with guanxi with the government, while location shows a stronger relationship with guanxi with the busi- ness. These results are consistent with our theo- retical discussion. Nonstate-owned ﬁrms attempt to build connections with government authorities to mitigate transaction costs and uncertainties due to ambiguous property rights. Nonstate-owned ﬁrms need institutional support and protection to secure access to key inputs and buyers. State- owned ﬁrms already have strong support by the government and instead need to pay more atten- tion to the relationship with the business com- munity. In contrast, guanxi with the government is the hole that needs to be ﬁlled by the nonstate- owned ﬁrms. Nonstate-owned ﬁrms have been institutionally discriminated against in taxation, bank loans, and registration. Nonstate-owned ﬁrms thus are left with no choice but to develop better relationships with the government that has control over these regulatory areas. Firms in nonopen areas commonly have a weakness (i.e., structural hole) in the relationship with suppliers, buyers, and distributors. In fact, the government offers signiﬁcantly more ﬁscal support and subsidizes more ﬁnancial resources to ﬁrms in nonopen areas than to those in open areas. Most ﬁrms (especially state-owned) in non- open areas know that their operating losses will be ﬁlled by the central government. In contrast, ﬁrms in open areas usually have strong networks with other ﬁrms, but they have more needs for networking with the government. The local government in open regions tends to have more autonomy and decision-making power than those in nonopen regions. Closer ties with the govern- ment in open regions thus imply special favors and privileges to the ﬁrms, especially in resource sourcing and/or special rights of doing businesses in a restricted area. Strategic orientation (i.e., the level of market effectiveness) is signiﬁcant for both applications Strat. Mgmt.

These results indicate that companies oriented toward market effectiveness are more likely to pursue guanxi networks because their focus is on market penetration and quick adaptation to changes in buyer needs or to any other competi- tive forces.

This is consistent with studies in the strategy literature that contend that companies build networks with competitive forces in the task environment to overcome organi- zational disadvantages. As predicted, size and resources are negatively related to guanxi with the business community at p < 0.01 and p < 0.1 respectively. There appear to be no differences between young and old organizations in terms of their attempts to develop guanxi networks. This may indicate that companies in China need to network actively with the business community and government authorities both to overcome the liability of newness or to ensure the survival and growth of older ﬁrms. In a transition economy with decreasing government protection, older ﬁrms may need to invest even more in guanxi development to be able to continue to offer and exchange favors with numerous constituencies that have been developed over time. Young ﬁrms may utilize guanxi inten- sively, while older ﬁrms use it more extensively. The control variable (i.e., industry growth index) was signiﬁcant and negatively related to both applications of guanxi at p < 0.1, indicating that ﬁrms pursue guanxi in a more adverse environ- ment such as that of slow-growing industries. Industry type is insigniﬁcant in relation with guanxi with the task environment, but is strongly associated with guanxi with the govern- ment. Speciﬁcally, service ﬁrms tend to use more guanxi with the government than manufacturing ﬁrms do, which is consistent with Yeung and Tung (1996). While manufacturing ﬁrms may need to pay more attention to develop strengths in traditional strategy areas, service businesses in general are more relationship-intensive and rely resources provided by the more on external government. Legal frameworks in the service sec- tor transition economies less Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. competition increasing even and in are Overall, sustainable strategic, and organizational 471 Guanxi and Organizational Dynamics developed than those in the manufacturing sector (Naughton, 1994). In China, many service indus- tries, such as investment banking, direct market- ing, and interprovincial transportation, are not yet fully open for market competition. As a result, top managers in service-oriented ﬁrms may have to devote more resources to constructing stronger and more ties with government ofﬁcials in order to coopt sources of environmen- tal uncertainty. the results indicate different appli- cations of guanxi across ﬁrms according to insti- settings. tutional, These ﬁrm-speciﬁc factors also affect the appli- cation of guanxi networks that ﬁrms will pursue. The weak support for organizational factors as antecedents to guanxi utilization with government authorities, however, does not imply that man- agers with strong resources do not use guanxi with government authorities. Rather, it may imply that ﬁrms in China develop and maintain good connections with government authorities regard- less of their resources. This is consistent with earlier ﬁndings that show that institutional uncer- tainties and ambiguous property rights necessitate networking with various government agencies for most ﬁrms in China (Peng and Heath, 1996). Table 3 presents the regression results for Mod- els 3 and 4 to test the impact of guanxi on performance while controlling for industry and other ﬁrm attributes. The results support our pre- dictions in Hypothesis 8; both applications of guanxi networks are signiﬁcant for sales growth but insigniﬁcant for profit growth. These results indicate that guanxi networks have a substantial impact on market expansion efforts, but less impact on accounting returns. Guanxi is basically a mechanism to position a ﬁrm in the market, not to improve its own internal operations. As indicated by previous studies, industry growth, ownership structure, and resource strength have signiﬁcant relationships with ﬁrm performance in China. Technological skills appear to have the strongest impact among the various ﬁrm attributes on market expansion and operational improve- ment. The results are also consistent with earlier ﬁndings about ownership structure, with nonstate- owned ﬁrms performing signiﬁcantly better than state-owned ﬁrms (Park et al., 1997; Nee, 1992). these results indicate the dynamics between ﬁrm-speciﬁc conditions, guanxi develop- ment, and performance of Chinese ﬁrms.

Guanxi then subsequently affects ﬁrm performance along with other ﬁrm-speciﬁc attributes. These ﬁrm-level settings deﬁne the antecedents for guanxi cultivation and sustenance, which then join forces with guanxi to affect performance, primarily market expansion. Guanxi cultivation constitutes an important element for survival and for market expansion of Chinese ﬁrms, but is not a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for overall performance. it is in China. Guanxi framework consists of DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS This paper examines organizational practices in guanxi utilization and the impact of guanxi on ﬁrm performance an important cultural and social element in Chinese society that has signiﬁcant effects on business operations, survival, and growth. Despite wide utilization of guanxi, there is a noticeable differ- ence among Chinese ﬁrms in the extent of guanxi utilization. Based on various organi- zational and strategy theories, we develop an integrative framework to explain the highly common, but idiosyncratic to each ﬁrm, practice of guanxi networking in Chinese organizations. The theoretical insti- tutional, strategic, and organizational factors, which characterize the setting for guanxi utili- zation. These factors determine the extent of needs and capacity for guanxi utilization. Our ﬁndings indicate that all three constructs are critical antecedents to the use of guanxi in China. An exception is the insigniﬁcant result for organizational factors in guanxi utilization with government authorities. Guanxi networking with government authorities seems to depend primarily on the institutional and strategic fac- tors of the ﬁrm. Guanxi with competitive forces can be attributed to institutional, strategic, and organizational factors. Our ﬁndings indicate that guanxi contributes to ﬁrm growth in terms of market expansion, but not in terms of improving net profit. This implies that guanxi in establishing external relations and legitimacy and positioning competitively in the market than in improving internal operations. This may explain the high costs to cultivate and maintain guanxi, which Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. is more important In a such as through operational 473 Guanxi and Organizational Dynamics to some extent offset the beneﬁts from market expansion, inef- ﬁciencies. This ﬁnding also supports the law of reciprocity in terms of guanxi. Firms connected through guanxi are obligated to return favors in order to maintain trust and not to lose face. Xin and Pearce (1996) posit that managers’ percep- tions about the importance of guanxi are reﬂected in actual investment and expenditures for gift giving and holding banquets. Luo and Chen (1996) also illustrate that guanxi between sellers and buyers leads to increased sales for the sellers, but at the expense of low prices or liberal terms of payments offered to the buyer. Overall, our ﬁndings reﬂect potential synergy gains in guanxi from resource complementarity and lower trans- action costs. transition economy with ambiguous property rights and weak legal con- straints on market competition, guanxi provides an opportunity to enhance market share through improved competitive positioning and other appli- cations of collaboration with competitors and government authorities. In addition to guanxi, other organizational contexts, such as strategic orientation and internal resources and capabilities, also affect ﬁrm performance in China. Guanxi affects ﬁrm growth directly by manipulating mar- ket transactions and competitive positions and indirectly by facilitating the implementation of business strategies. This paper presents empirical evidence of the key tenet in resource dependence theory that maintains that a ﬁrm’s possession and control of important resources determine the extent of external dependence and Salancik, 1978). organizations with advanced skills and resources are less dependent on guanxi connections. This is also consistent with Burt’s notion of structural holes. Our ﬁnd- ings indicate that guanxi is a mechanism for Chinese ﬁrms not only to exploit and accumu- late social capital but also to broker structural gaps with key stakeholders in the environment. Firms tend to establish guanxi networks to over- come strategic and institutional weaknesses by linking with those that are remotely related with the ﬁrm but have a strong control over key resources. Our ﬁndings are also in line with Seabright et al. (1992) regarding the negative outcome of time. Repeated interactions in a guanxi network lead to that Strat. Mgmt. J., 22: 455–477 (2001) individual attachment over relationship embedded example, (Pfeffer For a socially S. H. Park and Y. Luo 474 demands continual commitment from all parties. On one hand, the personal attachments that develop over time, mainly among executives, constitute social assets that enforce the continu- ation of the guanxi connection. Such attach- ments make the guanxi sustainable, transferable, and intangible and attenuate difﬁculties due to uncertain changes in the environment. On the other hand, however, such attachments produce inertia that operates against implementing inter- nal changes to spur profit enhancement. Guanxi emerges over time as social and relational assets that promote sales growth, but not necessarily profit growth. Economic motivations for guanxi networking become diluted or are offset as the connected parties observe the norm of reci- procity and attempt to sustain the network at any cost. This paper conﬁrms and extends conceptual projects on guanxi in earlier studies (e.g., Xin and Pearce, 1996). First, this paper provides empirical evidence to the claim that guanxi utilization is heterogeneous across ﬁrms and depends on the institutional, strategic, and organizational settings of each ﬁrm. Second, it tests the effect of guanxi on performance, of Yeung and Tung (1996) that guanxi leads to higher ﬁrm performance, with a stronger impact on market expansion and sales growth than on ﬁnancial returns. Lastly, this paper validates the multiple dimensions of guanxi as pertinent and promising. Guanxi in China represents two dis- tinctive applications of a single networking skill: one horizontally applied with competitive forces and the other vertically applied with government study incorporates both net- authorities. Our working skills in the development of theory and empirical the pursuit of either or both applications of guanxi depends on the institutional, strategic, and organi- zational settings. Guanxi with competitive forces and with government authorities bring different beneﬁts and make different demands on member companies. Future studies need to recognize these multiple applications of guanxi and to delineate the differences in order to avoid spurious ﬁndings and conclusions. Guanxi has been developed over many cen- turies in China. It reﬂects highly complex social phenomena that are embedded in every aspect of personal and organizational interactions. Our study illuminates the rich dynamics in such Copyright  2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. tests. The ﬁndings indicate that complementing ﬁndings institutional setting it organizational networking in China. It presents a snapshot of guanxi dynamics at a critical point of China’s economic reform. There is a need for more studies with new theoretical insights to enrich our understanding of the com- plexity in guanxi connections. In particular, anthropological observations over a long time period are needed to explore the evolutionary process of guanxi networks. Such studies will help us understand how a person or an organi- zation initiates, cultivates, maintains, and dis- solves guanxi over time. The nature and impor- tance of guanxi may also vary depending on the evolutionary stage of development. It would also be worthwhile to explore interrelationships among the antecedents of guanxi utilization. In particular, given the strong institutional effect on ﬁrm operations in China’s transition econ- omy, it is possible that a ﬁrm’s strategic and organizational settings are constrained by the speciﬁc faces. This requires further theoretical and empirical explo- ration in future studies. Readers should also be cautioned about the potential bias in measuring competitiveness and other industry related mea- sures. In China, managers are often ill-informed about competitors outside their locality, which is more so in small ﬁrms than in large ﬁrms. They also tend to adopt a narrow deﬁnition of industries and competitors. is by no means culturally unique to China. It exists to some extent in every human society, at least in terms of the norms of reci- procity. What varies from culture to culture is the types of particularistic ties and the intensity of their application (Tsui and Farh, 1997). Given the universality of the inﬂuence of guanxi, it would be important to conduct comparative stud- ies to properly assess the importance of guanxi in China. Future studies need to adopt cross- cultural research to be able to fully grasp the role of guanxi in Chinese society. This study, however, focuses on the antecedents of guanxi that may differ across cultures and ﬁrms. Our ﬁndings thus should be limited to the speciﬁc social in China, especially during the period of economic reform. This study is also limited in its focus on guanxi utilization at is equally active and important at the individual level, which may also have a signiﬁcant impact on ﬁrm per- formance.

This requires a careful attention in future research to compare and differentiate bases and roles of guanxi at the individual and ﬁrm levels. It is also important that future studies further delineate the nature of guanxi; for example, pecuniary guanxi (e.g., holding banquets or gift giving) as opposed to nonpecuniary guanxi may have different impli- cations for organizational dynamics and perfor- mance.
