Introduction (cid:14) Despite the paucity of scientific evidence attesting to the effectiveness of W. Edwards Deming’s quality management approach see Deming, 1986, 1993 , it has received considerable attention from manufactur- ing and service organizations around the world see Hodgson, 1987 . In part, this is because Deming has often been credited with contributing to Japan’s eco- nomic revitalization after World War II Deming, 1986; Walton, 1986; Yoshida, 1989 . Deming’s qual- .

Support for those adhering to this ‘univer- sal perspective’ can be inferred from 1 broad state- ments that encourage firms to adopt quality manage- (cid:14) . ment e.g., General Accounting Office, 1991 , 2 claims that quality management is not bound by (cid:14) (cid:14) . national culture e.g., Choi and Liker, 1995 , 3 research describing the successful adoption of qual- including Russia Birch ity management globally, (cid:14) . and Pooley, 1995 , Israel Mitki and Shani, 1995 , and Singapore Sohal et al., 1989 , or encouraging the adoption of quality management in other regions of the world Lee et al., 1992 , and 4 conclusions of research comparing U.S. companies against com- panies in other countries e.g., Japan that generally urge U.S. companies to adopt quality management in order to enhance their competitive ability e.g. Yavas, . 1995 .

Goonatilake (cid:14) 1988 and Mersha 1997 have argued, for example, that developing countries possess a host of sociopo- litical and socioeconomic factors that the transferability of quality management concepts, prin- ciples, and techniques to these countries. With re- spect to the Deming Management Method, Yoshida (cid:14) 1989 argued that certain cultural constraints hinder the widespread applicability of the Deming Manage- ment Method in the U.S. and other Western civiliza- tions. Garvin 1986, p. 669 also had the following caution: firms to mimic Japanese quality practices without first adapting them to local conditions are unlikely to be completely successful, even though practices in both countries were originally derived from the same sources.’’ ‘‘ . . . attempts by U.S. . . (cid:14) In this paper, we present research that contributes . . (cid:14) to the debate on the universal applicability of quality management, and in doing so, subject the ‘one size fits all’ assumption see Newman and Nollen, 1996; p. 753 of quality management to an empirical exam- ination. We intend our research to be a stimulus into more theoretical and empirical investigations of when and where quality management might be applicable, as well as how quality management might need to be adapted in its application. Specifically, we present the replication results of an empirical evaluation of a Deming-based theory of quality management. This theory was recently articulated by Anderson et al. (cid:14) 1994b and subsequently subjected to an empirical . examination in the work of Anderson et al. 1995 . Except for enhancements in instrumentation, we at- tempted to replicate, as closely as possible, the An- derson et al. 1995 study. In our replication, we apply path analysis to secondary, plant-level, data provided by a stratified sample of plants in three different industries in Italy. The path analytical re- sults from the current replication study are then compared against those reported in the study of (cid:14) Anderson et al. 1995 and discussed in the context of conducting and interpreting cross-cultural quality management research. We conclude with the need for more replication studies in the quality manage- ment discipline and with implications for research and practice. (cid:14) (cid:14) . . 2. A Deming-based theory of quality management (cid:14) . (cid:14) Anderson et al. 1994b recently articulated an integrative theory of quality management to describe and explain the process and effectiveness of adopting the Deming Management Method henceforth re- . ferred to as the ARS theory of quality management . . In their theory development, Anderson et al. 1994b identified and defined seven constructs as forming the theoretical blocks for describing, explaining, and predicting the organizational performance impact of quality management adoption. These seven con- structs—Visionary Leadership, Internal and External Cooperation, Learning, Process Management, Con- tinuous Improvement, Employee Fulfillment, and Customer Satisfaction—were derived from a concep- tual synthesis of literature on the Deming Manage- (cid:14) M. Rungtusanatham et al.rJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 77–95 ( ) 79 ment Method and from the input of a panel of subject-matter-experts identified from both academia and industry. Table 1 reproduces the nominal defini- tions for the seven constructs. In theorizing the organizational performance im- pact of quality management adoption, Anderson et al. 1994b, pp. 479–480 postulated that the effec- tiveness of adopting Deming’s quality management approach: . (cid:14) . . . arises from leadership efforts toward the simulta- neous creation of a cooperative and learning organi- zation to facilitate the implementation of process- management practices, which, when implemented, support customer satisfaction and organizational sur- vival through sustained employee fulfillment and continuous improvement of processes, products, and services . . . Captured in this succinct statement are four proposi- tions specifying the ‘causal’ relationships among the seven constructs that had been identified: Proposition 1: Visionary leadership enables the si- multaneous creation of a cooperative and learning organization. Proposition 2: An organization that simultaneously fosters cooperation and learning facilitates the imple- mentation of process management practices. Proposition 3: Process management practices simul- taneously result in continuous improvement of qual- ity and employee fulfillment. Proposition 4: An organization’s simultaneous ef- forts continuously to improve its quality and to fulfill its employees lead to higher customer satisfaction. Proposition 1 stresses the critical role that leader- ship plays in ensuring the success of quality manage- ment adoption. Proposition 2 emphasizes the impor- tance of both cooperation and continual learning in helping an organization to implement process man- agement practices that include both human resource management practices e.g., teams and methodolog- (cid:14) . ical approaches e.g., statistical process control . Proposition 3 describes the two immediate outcomes of continuous quality improvement and employee fulfillment that an organization derives from effec- tive implementation methodological and human re- (cid:14) . Table 1 . Theoretical constructs and nominal definitions From Anderson et al., 1994b; p. 480 (cid:14) Visionary Leadership The ability of management to establish, practice, and lead a long-term vision for the organization, driven by changing customer requirements, as opposed to an internal management control role Internal and External Cooperation The propensity of the organization to engage in non-competitive activities internally among employees and externally with respect to suppliers Learning The organizational capability to recognize and nurture the development of its skills, abilities, and knowledge bases Process Management The set of methodological and behavioral practices emphasizing the management of process, or means of actions, rather than results Continuous Impro˝ement The propensity of the organization to pursue incremental and innovative improvements of its processes, products, and services Employee Fulfillment The degree to which employees of an organization feel that the organization continually satisfies their needs Customer Satisfaction The degree to which an organization’s customers continually perceive that their needs are being met by the organization’s products and services 80 M. Rungtusanatham et al.rJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 77–95 ( ) (cid:14) sources management practices underlying Process Management. Proposition 4 theorizes that continu- ously improving quality and fulfilling employees represent requisite conditions that, in turn, contribute to an organization’s ability to satisfy its present customers and, at the same time, to identify opportu- nities for satisfying future customers. Together, these four propositions depict the path diagram in Fig. 1. . In a subsequent paper, Anderson et al. 1995 reported the results for an empirical examination of the four propositions comprising their theory of qual- ity management. These empirical results were based on a secondary data source provided by U.S. plants in Round 1 of the World-Class Manufacturing (cid:14) .WCM research project. Data for the WCM research project were collected from multiple informants (cid:14)eight different managers, three supervisors, and 10 . workers in 41 plants via pen-and-paper question- naires. Different informants received questionnaires with different content measurement items. For in- stance, the human resources manager received a questionnaire asking about the plant’s approach to issues of training, compensation, selection, etc., whereas, the process engineer responded to questions about process design and control. The majority of these measurement items were structured as percep- tual questions with forced-choice response formats, but several measurement items, asking for factual, (cid:14) . quantifiable data e.g., scrap rate , were also in- cluded in the relevant questionnaires. To empirically examine the ARS theory of quality management, Anderson et al. 1995 performed four (cid:14) . (cid:14) . sequential tasks. First, they selected perceptual mea- surement items from Round 1 of the WCM research project in order to create multi-item measurement scales for each of the seven constructs. The internal consistency reliability and dimensionality of these measurement scales were respectively assessed by computing and evaluating Cronbach’s a coefficient (cid:14) see Cronbach, 1951 and by interpreting the results of exploratory factor analysis with no rotation, with these results indicating acceptable reliability and . uni-dimensionality. Second, Anderson et al. 1995 constructed plant-by-plant, composite scores for each of the seven constructs. These aggregate scores were computed by firstly averaging the responses of dif- ferent within-plant informants to the same measure- ment item. Then the measurement items within the same measurement scale were averaged by plant. Each construct, therefore, had a vector of 41 com- posite scores, one for each plant. Third, Anderson et al. 1995 conducted an analysis of industry effects on the mean and variance levels of the empirical measures for the seven constructs. Industry effects were found to be significant in explaining differ- ences across the three industries and were subse- quently controlled for by standardizing the data by industry. Fourth, path analysis was applied to the standardized-by-industry data to compute eight path coefficients, two for each of the four propositions. Direct, indirect, and unexplained effects were then decomposed from the observed correlation among the empirical measures for the seven constructs and the path analytical results. In summary, the path (cid:14) . . Fig. 1. The theory of quality management underlying the Deming Management Method from Anderson et al., 1994b; p. 481 . (cid:14) M.

The present replication study . (cid:14) Since our intent is to conduct a constructive repli- cation of the Anderson et al. 1995 study, we at- tempted to maximize the similarities between this replication and the earlier study. Two differences, however, deserve further clarification, these being the source of data for this replication and the opera- tionalization of the seven constructs. 3.1. Round 2 of the WCM research project: Italian plants (cid:14) . Whereas data for the Anderson et al. 1995 study were provided by Round 1 of the WCM research project, data for this replication came from Italian plants that were studied in Round 2 of the WCM research project. The WCM research project was a multi-year project to develop a better understanding of what world-class manufacturing practices in- cluded and how these practices would affect organi- zational performance. ‘World-Class Manufacturing,’ for the project, was defined based on the writings of Hayes and Wheelwright 1985 and Schonberger (cid:14) . . (cid:14) . (cid:14) 1986 . Round 1 data were collected from U.S. plants during 1989 and 1990. A recent description of Round 1 of the WCM project can be found in the work of Flynn et al. 1997 . Round 2 of the WCM project extended data collection to plants in other countries, including Italy, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The Italian plant data were col- lected during 1992. When the current replication study began in 1995, only the data from the Italian plants had been completed, cleaned, and made avail- able to the researchers. For Round 2, the various questionnaires that were employed in Round 1 were modified and improved. Table 2 provides a breakdown of the total number of questionnaires employed in Round 2, the total num- ber of different employees that answered these ques- tionnaires, and the total number of informants from each plant. A panel of five Italian academic experts on manu- facturing management then engaged in an iterative process to translate these modified questionnaires from English into Italian. All translation disagree- ments were resolved via a group process involving all five experts. A professional translator, whose native language was English, then back translated the Italian versions into English in order to verify the equivalence of the Italian versions to the English versions. As a final check, the Italian questionnaires were reviewed and pre-tested with a small group of Table 2 Questionnaires and informants in the Italian WCM sample Type of informant Plant research coordinator Plant manager Plant superintendent Quality manager Process engineer Inventory and purchasing manager Production control manager Information system manager Human resource manager Plant accountant (cid:14) .

Rungtusanatham et al.rJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 77–95 ( ) three non-academic individuals to assess whether or not the questionnaires could be answered by individ- uals with limited education, with two of these indi- viduals having received only a secondary level edu- cation. In building the sample of Italian plants, only manufacturing companies from the Machine Tools, Electronics, and Transportation-Related industries were considered; this strategy allowed the Italian sample to be comparable with the U.S. sample from Round 1 of the WCM research project. Furthermore, these companies had to have manufacturing facilities located in Italy and to employ at least 100 employ- ees. Companies with these characteristics were then classified as either ‘Traditional’ or ‘World-Class,’ based on the opinions of 10 experts and on their organizational profiles in Italian trade journals. The 10 experts included academic researchers, consul- tants, and industry managers, with expertise in par- ticular industrial sectors andror managerial aspects of WCM. Italian trade journals were used to expand the list of possible WCM firms, and in some cases, to confirm the ‘World-Class’ status of companies that had been identified by experts. To ensure the integrity of the classification, a face-to-face meeting was arranged so that the 10 experts could discuss the classification results. During this discussion, when- ever doubts arose as to a firm’s designation as ‘World-Class,’ evidence that the firm had imple- mented some WCM practices, either from trade jour- nals or from expert knowledge, had to be provided. Otherwise, the firm would not be included in the sampling frame. From this sampling frame, the Italian WCM re- search team in Italy then contacted 85 companies by phone and by mail to explain the research program and objectives. Thirty companies refused to partici- pate; these 30 companies were either facing major restructuring problems or had defense contracts that prohibited them from sharing sensitive company-re- lated information. The remaining 55 companies (cid:14) 65% selected one plant to participate in Round 2 of the WCM research project. Generally, the ‘best’ plant was selected. A plant research coordinator from each selected plant was appointed to serve as a liaison between the plant and the Italian WCM re- search team. Plant visits were scheduled with each of the 55 plants, during which the research objectives . and design were explained and interviews were con- ducted with the plant research coordinators and vari- ous managers within the plants. During initial plant visits, the plant research coor- dinator, along with at least one member of the Italian WCM research team, would jointly select the plant informants to answer the various questionnaires, with the exception of the three questionnaires for direct labor. In the case of direct labor, because of the promise of anonymity, the names of employees were kept anonymous, although the selection process at- tempted to include both union and non-union repre- sentation. Questionnaires would then be administered to the selected informants by the plant research coordinator and returned to the plant research coordi- nator who then forwarded the completed question- naires to the research team. Of the 55 plants that had been visited, 10 dropped out for various reasons discovered during or after the visit. Some plant research coordinators did not wish to continue after learning of the research objectives and design, citing a lack of interest or believing that the data were too sensitive. Some agreed to partici- pate but were not able to guarantee sufficient com- pleteness of the various questionnaires to warrant further consideration. Finally, some agreed to admin- ister the questionnaires but heavy production de- mands prevented the timely administration of the questionnaires for inclusion into Round 2 of the WCM project. The remaining 45 plants that agreed to participate in the WCM study did return their questionnaires, but the questionnaire sets from two plants were discarded because of excessive missing data. The final sample, therefore, contained 43 plants of which 38 are Italian-owned plants, 2 are American-owned plants, 2 are French-owned plants, and 1 is a Ger- man-owned plant. The distribution of these plants across ‘Traditional’ vs. ‘World-Class’ categories is shown in Table 3. and across industries 3.2. Operationalization and measurement of theoreti- cal constructs For this replication, the seven theoretical con- structs were operationalized as multi-item measure- ment scales, containing selected perceptual measure- ment items from Round 2 of the WCM research M.

(cid:14) questionnaires. Many of the measurement items em- ployed in the Anderson et al. 1995 study were retained, with exceptions noted in Appendix A. These exceptions included the addition of new measure- ment items to, andror the deletion of measurement items from, the measurement scales used in Ander- son et al. 1995 . In general, the addition andror deletion of measurement items were undertaken to maximize the internal consistency reliability and the dimensionality of the respective measurement scales, an approach suggested in the work by Churchill (cid:14) 1979 and successfully applied by Graham et al. (cid:14) 1994 . Table 4 shows Cronbach’s a coefficients and principal components factor analysis results for these modified measurement scales. . . The data for the measurement scales were then used to create plant-level aggregate scores for each construct, following the approach in Anderson et al. (cid:14) 1995 . First, the average score for each item was computed across all within-plant informants who responded to the item. Then, the measurement items . constituting each measurement scale were averaged by plant to form an aggregate, plant-level score for the corresponding theoretical construct. Each con- struct, therefore, has 43 values, one per plant, with the exception of Employee Fulfillment, which has only 34 values due to missing data. 3.3. Hypotheses The four propositions in the ARS theory of qual- ity management can be restated as eight testable hypotheses. For example, stated in standard null form, Proposition 1 suggests the following two hy- potheses, as follows. Hypothesis 1: Visionary Leadership is not positively related to Internal and External Cooperation. Hypothesis 2: Visionary Leadership is not positively related to Learning.

Rungtusanatham et al.rJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 77–95 ( ) The remaining six hypotheses that can be derived from Proposition 2 Hypotheses 3 and 4 , from Proposition 3 Hypotheses 5 and 6 , and from Propo- sition 4 Hypotheses 7 and 8 include the following hypotheses. (cid:14) . . . (cid:14) (cid:14) Hypothesis 3: Internal and External Cooperation is not positively related to Process Management.

Hypothesis 8: Employee Fulfillment tively related to Customer Satisfaction. is not posi- 3.4. Analytical approach In this replication, the eight hypotheses were em- pirically examined by applying the method of path analysis to the data from the Italian plants see Land, 1969; Li, 1975 for an introduction to the theory and mechanics of path analysis . In the context of path analysis, the eight hypotheses can be operationalized as the path diagram shown in Fig. 2. The two arrows (cid:14) . from Visionary Leadership to Internal and External Cooperation and from Visionary Leadership to Learning are, therefore, consistent with Hypotheses 1 and 2, respectively. Because the 43 plants were drawn from three different industries, industry effects were suspected to play a significant role in explaining the variation in the data, just as industry effects were significant in the Anderson et al. 1995 study. This suspicion was confirmed by analyzing the across-industry mean and variance levels for the empirical measures of the seven constructs see Table 5 . To remove industry effects, the data were standardized by industry. (cid:14) . (cid:14) . . (cid:14) To apply path analysis, the data were standardized again and regression analysis was then employed to estimate the magnitudes of the eight path coefficients in Fig. 2. Because path coefficients are equivalent to standardized regression coefficients Wright, 1960; see also the work of Li, 1975 , the statistical signifi- cance of path coefficients can be examined using conventional t-tests and the statistical significance of hypothesized relationships can be evaluated by inter- (cid:14) preting coefficients of determination, R Lewis- Beck, 1974; McPherson and Huang, 1974 . Addi- . tionally, support or lack of support for the eight hypotheses was determined by computing and evalu- ating the magnitude of the pair-wise direct, indirect, and unexplained effects between empirical measures (cid:14) for the seven constructs see Alwin and Hauser, 1981 . These effects are derived by decomposing the observed correlation R between two empirical measures, x and y, into the direct effects from x to . (cid:14) y D , the indirect effects from x to y I , and x y . (cid:14) . (cid:14) . 2 x y (cid:14) . x y Fig. 2. A path model of the eight hypotheses. M.

Three of the eight hypothe- sized paths—from Learning to Process Management (cid:14) Hypothesis 4 , from Process Management to Em- (cid:14) ployee Fulfillment Hypothesis 6 and from Em- ployee Fulfillment to Customer Satisfaction Hy- pothesis 8 —did not support statistically significant path coefficients. Therefore, in the context of the four theoretical propositions, only Proposition 1 re- ceived full empirical support, whereas the remaining three propositions received mixed empirical support. Table 7 reports the decomposition of the empiri- cal correlation coefficients into direct, indirect, and unexplained effects. For example, the correlation between empirical measures for Visionary Leader- p - ship and Continuous Improvement is 0.493 0.001 , but the path model in Fig. 2 hypothesized an indirect relationship between Visionary Leadership and Continuous Improvement, with this indirect ef- (cid:14) . fect amounting to 0.122. Therefore, Fig. 2, as hy- pothesized, explained only 24.7% of the observed correlation between Visionary Leadership and Con- tinuous Improvement. Consequently, Visionary Leadership may affect Continuous Improvement ei- ther directly i.e., a direct path exists between the two or in some other indirect manner via another variable that is not currently included in the path diagram. The decomposition results for the empirical measures of other constructs in Fig. 2 can be inter- preted in a similar manner. (cid:14) . . (cid:14) Finally, Table 8 compares the replication results for the Italian plants to the results for the U.S. plants in Anderson et al. 1995 . As highlighted in Table 8, consistent empirical support for four of the eight hypothesized paths can be observed between the U.S. sample and the Italian sample. For plants in both the U.S. and Italian samples, Visionary Leader- ship was observed to have a positive and statistically significant effect on Internal and External Coopera- tion Hypothesis 1 .

Furthermore, for the samples of plants from both countries, Learning and Process Management were not statistically related, after adjusting for the effect of Internal and External Cooperation on Process . Management Hypothesis 4 . (cid:14) (cid:14) (cid:14) . For two of the remaining four hypothesized paths, minor differences were detected. For example, Hy- pothesis 2, which relates Visionary Leadership to Learning, received strong empirical support in the Anderson et al. 1995 study—a path coefficient of 0.46 that was statistically significant at p -0.002. But, for the Italian data, the path coefficient from Visionary Leadership to Learning was statistically significant at p -0.056 only. As for Hypothesis 6, the U.S. sample provided weak support for the path from Process Management to Employee Fulfillment, path coefficients0.27, p -0.085 ; whereas, (cid:14) this relationship was not statistically supported in this replication. However, when interpreted in a more conservative manner it could be argued that Hypothesis 6 would have been rejected for both samples of U.S. and Italian plants. e.g., as0.05 , (cid:14) . . The remaining two hypotheses involving Cus- tomer Satisfaction Hypotheses 7 and 8 are, per- haps, most intriguing. In the Anderson et al. 1995; (cid:14) . (cid:14) .

But in this replica- tion, Customer Satisfaction was found to correlate with all constructs except Employee Fulfillment see Table 7 , explaining empirically the statistically non-significant path from Employee Fulfillment to Customer Satisfaction. . (cid:14) . 5. Discussion of results (cid:14) . To date, the Anderson et al. 1995 study is the only empirical examination of the ARS theory of quality management. While there have been other empirical studies of quality management, these em- pirical studies have been based on other quality management frameworks e.g., Flynn et al., 1995; . Hendricks and Singhal, 1996; Powell, 1995 . (cid:14) . (cid:14) . (cid:14) Considered from the typology of management studies involving culture by Adler 1983 , the Ander- son et al. 1995 study represents a parochial study, since the research was conducted in one culture (cid:14) U.S. context by researchers in that culture U.S.- trained researchers . According to Adler 1983, p. .32 , a parochial study typically makes the implicit assumption that the underlying theory and resulting empirical findings are universal, when, in fact, they are most likely: . (cid:14) . (cid:14) 88 M. Rungtusanatham et al.rJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 77–95 ( ) . . . applicable only to one culture, the culture in which the research was conducted . . . American stud- ies conducted in the United States are, at best appli- cable to the United States. They may or may not be applicable to Africa, Asia, Europe, or Central and South America. . formative indicators, see Fornell and Bookstein, 1982 . Likewise, in this replication, we maximized Cronbach’s a for the Italian sample, and in our empirical analysis, operationalized theoretical con- structs as aggregate scores formed by averaging indi- vidual measurement items. . Therefore, in order to assess whether a theory is potentially applicable outside of one culture, Adler (cid:14) 1983 urged that research designs explicitly incor- porate and evaluate the impact of culture, one sug- gested research design being ethnocentric research. Ethnocentric research designs: w u n d e r th e m o re x . . . ask the question: ‘Can this theory, which is appli- cable in Culture A be extended to Culture B?’ . . . and xare primarily searching for similarity across cultural conditions, for validation in extending . . . theoretical fra m e w o rk s e x tre m e w conditions . . . with replications being . . . the most common approach to ethnocentric research . . . an at- tempt is made to keep all aspects of the research design and its implementation with the exception of language identical across the two cultures. As far as possible, the research is conducted in the same way, with the same types of people, using the same instru- mentation except for language , administered with the same instructions, and analyzed using the same . methods in both cultures . . . Adler, 1983, p. 33 . (cid:14) . (cid:14) . (cid:14) . (cid:14) From the preceding description, it is clear that the conduct of the empirical study reported herein ap- proximates ethnocentric research. The detraction from an ideal ethnocentric research design arises because the data collection instrument employed in this replication differed from that used in Anderson et al. 1995 . However, differences in instrumenta- tion do not necessarily deter cross-cultural compar- isons in management research, a case in point being the examination of negotiation behavior in multiple countries by Graham et al. 1994 . Because Cron- bach’s a’s for several constructs were unacceptably . low for several foreign samples, Graham et al. 1994 deleted relevant measurement items on a country- by-country basis to maximize Cronbach’s a’s and employed formative measurement indicators to oper- ationalize theoretical constructs for a discussion of (cid:14) (cid:14) . (cid:14) (cid:14) . (cid:14) . (cid:14) Furthermore, from a cross-cultural comparative perspective, Hofstede 1984 has shown that the Italian culture differs from the U.S. culture along such cultural dimensions as Power Distance higher . in Italy , Uncertainty Avoidance higher in Italy , Individualism lower in Italy , and Masculinity (cid:14) higher in Italy . Because the U.S. and Italian cul- tures are dissimilar, observed similarities between the research results in this replication and those in the Anderson et al. 1995 study can be conserva- tively interpreted to be indicative of possible, rather than confirming, universality. More precisely, Adler (cid:14) 1983, p. 34 has provided the following caution: (cid:14) . . (cid:14) . . In cross-cultural replication studies, similar findings are most frequently interpreted as confirmation that x the theory being tested is, in fact, universal . . . the more appropriate conclusion would be either that the particular results are not solely dependent on cultural factors in the first culture or that the results appear applicable to the second culture. The conclusion, from a two-culture study, that the results are univer- sal is unwarranted. w With this caution in mind, it can be concluded that several of the hypothesized relationships in the ARS theory of quality management appear to be applicable in describing, explaining, and predicting ‘quality management’-related organizational forms (cid:14) . i.e., in Italy . and behavior beyond the U.S. context In both the U.S. and the Italian contexts, organiza- tional leaders play a critical role in developing and communicating a vision that can enable the creation of an organizational system—one that is cooperative in nature and willing to engage in learning. Coopera- tion, in turn, makes it easier to implement practices that focus on managing the process as opposed to managing the outcomes of the process. These pro- cess management practices ultimately support the continuous improvement of process, product, and service quality. M. Rungtusanatham et al.rJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 77–95 ( ) 89 . (cid:14) (cid:14) . (cid:14) Also, in both the U.S. and Italy, Learning did not appear to facilitate the implementation of process management practices, as conjectured. However, the failure to observe a statistically significant relation- ship between Learning and Process Management may be attributed to the effects of multi-collinearity, since Learning and Internal and External Cooperation were observed to be positively and statistically correlated. In Anderson et al. 1995, p. 650 , the zero-order correlation between Learning and Internal and Exter- . nal Cooperation was found to be 0.76 p -0.001 ; whereas, for this replication sample, a correlation of p -0.001 was computed. Another possible 0.604 explanation, however, may be the inadequate opera- tionalization of the Learning construct’s domain. Deming 1990 and others e.g., Anderson et al., 1992, 1994a have urged organizations to supple- ment training in domain or task knowledge with training and education in ‘profound knowledge’ i.e., systems theory, statistics, psychology, and theory of knowledge . In their urgings, these scholars argued that training and education in the disciplines of ‘profound knowledge’ are critical to effective contin- uous quality improvement efforts. Yet, in both the Anderson et al. 1995 study and the current replica- tion, the Learning construct could only be opera- tionalized as task-related training. (cid:14) (cid:14) (cid:14) . . . (cid:14) . Whereas similar findings in cross-cultural replica- tions support the applicability of a particular theory across different cultures, inconsistent findings across different cultures should arguably lead to the conclu- sion that the particular theory does not apply across different cultures. Such a conclusion seems appropri- ate for the hypothesized relationships involving the Employee Fulfillment construct in the ARS theory of quality management. However, the same logic about not drawing conclusions of universality based on similar findings from a two-culture study can be made in the case of differences in the comparative results of two cultures. Furthermore, as Shenkar and von Glinow 1994; p. 68 demonstrated in studying the applicability of different theories in China, there may be ‘ . . . degrees of applicability . . . ’—these de- grees of applicability possibly arising because of one or more of the following conditions: a the assump- tions underlying the theory do not hold in different cultures, b problems in conceptualization or instru- (cid:14) . mentation, c marginal empirical support, and d (cid:14) . (cid:14) . (cid:14) . . (cid:14) missing constructs in the theory being tested. Hence, observed differences in the Employee Fulfillment results reported here and in the Anderson et al. (cid:14) 1995 study may be attributed to one or more of these conditions. . . (cid:14) (cid:14) (cid:14) In retrospect, we suspect that the conceptualiza- tion of Employee Fulfillment, defined as the degree to which employees are able to derive pride from the workmanship, satisfaction, and commitment from . what they do see Anderson et al., 1994b; p. 489 , may not be applicable in the Italian culture for two reasons. First, as computed in Hofstede 1984, p. .189 , the Italian culture has a relatively high Mas- culinity score of 70 compared to an mean of 51—a reflection of strong Catholic tenets, that fundamen- tally view the female gender as being secondary to the male gender. The man, being the primary provider in a family, is under societal pressure to be a source of financial resources, and is motivated more by extrinsic benefits such as wages and bonuses than by pride of workmanship Bonazzi, 1993 . Second, since the end of the Second World War, the Italian indus- trial work environment has been influenced strongly by Marxism. Marxist ideology has led to a clear demarcation between employers and employees and unions , resulting in both sides maintaining a tradi- tional ‘arm’s length’ approach in dealing with one another. On one hand, employees generally do not believe that management is concerned for their wel- fare and are extremely wary of management initia- tives that relate to the work they do. On the other hand, employers are more inclined to devise extrin- sic, as opposed to intrinsic, modes to motivate and satisfy the workforce see Pinaud, 1992; Gunnigle et . al., 1994; Sirianni, 1995; Hardy and Clegg, 1996 . Therefore, the lack of empirical support for hypothe- sized relationships involving Employee Fulfillment in the Italian data may arise not because these rela- tionships are conceptually invalid but, perhaps, be- cause the Employee Fulfillment construct itself does not have definitional equivalence from the U.S. con- text to the Italian context. (cid:14) . (cid:14) 6. Conclusion Lindsay and Ehrenberg 1993; p. 217 made the observation that ‘‘ . . . replication in the social sci- ences is rare . . . ’’ It should, therefore, not come as a (cid:14) . 90 M. Rungtusanatham et al.rJournal of Operations Management 17 1998 77–95 ( ) surprise to observe that in the quality management discipline, there are virtually no replication studies of previously published results. Yet, the conduct of replication studies has long been recognized as being crucial to the ongoing process of scientific inquiry and to the development and growth of scientific knowledge within a given discipline see Lykken, . 1968; Reynolds, 1971 . (cid:14) w (cid:14) . . (cid:14) . (cid:14) In this respect, our replication, although not a . ‘pure’ replication of the Anderson et al. 1995 study, does make a unique contribution to the disci- pline of quality management—it represents the first explicit attempt to determine ‘‘ . . . whether or not . . . the empirical results reported in Anderson et x al. 1995 are . . . potentially generalizable at all’’ (cid:14) Lindsay and Ehrenberg, 1993, p. 217 . We believe that more replications are necessary and should be encouraged before any conclusive statements, either in favor or against, the proposed Deming-based the- ory of quality management can and should be made. According to Lykken 1968, p. 155 : . . . demonstrat- ing an empirical fact ‘‘must involve a chain of confidence in the replicability of one’s findings . . . ,’’ such confidence naturally resulting from numerous attempts to falsify previously reported findings. Hence, we urge that future research efforts not only replicate the earlier Anderson et al. 1995 study with a different U.S.-based sample, either within the same or in different sets of industries, but also replicate the current study involving Italian organiza- tions. Ideally, simultaneous empirical examinations of the ARS theory of quality management across multiple cultures should be pursued. To do so, re- searchers in quality management need to develop critical understanding and appreciation of the methodological issues involved in conducting cross- cultural empirical research. Many of these issues have been raised and discussed in the works of Mullen 1995 , Singh 1995 , Riordan and Vanden- (cid:14) berg 1994 , and, more recently, Cavusgil and Das (cid:14) . 1997 . (cid:14) (cid:14) . . (cid:14) . . While existing empirical studies on the relation- ships conceptualized in the ARS theory of quality management have been informative, from a research standpoint, we want to encourage the design and conduct of confirmatory, as opposed to exploratory, empirical tests of the ARS theory of quality manage- ment. A critical challenge, however, lies ahead for those interested in conducting such confirmatory em- pirical studies—one that pertains to the construction of reliable and valid methods for measuring the seven constructs in the ARS theory of quality man- agement. The importance of satisfying this challenge cannot be over-emphasized; for without reliable and valid measures that enable data collection from pri- mary sources, the substantive validity of the relation- ships in the ARS theory of quality management cannot be definitively established see Bagozzi et al., . 1991 . (cid:14) From a managerial perspective, the results from this replication should further raise awareness of the potential cultural bounds of the quality management phenomenon as multinational corporations make conscious decisions to transfer the organizational forms and behaviors underlying quality management to other countries. This awareness should help orga- nizations to better manage the diffusion of quality management from the home country environment to foreign country environments, and specifically to identify cultural barriers that may inhibit the adop- tion of quality management principles, concepts, and practices. . (cid:14) (cid:14) Our research results, particularly with respect to Employee Fulfillment, suggest that in instances where the values underlying quality management conflict with the values of the culture in which quality . management is to be diffused i.e., the target culture , this diffusion might be hindered see also, Amund- son et al., 1997 . In such instances, for quality management practices to be successfully transferred, the conflict between values underlying quality man- agement practices and those of the target culture should be reconciled. Pragmatically, this reconcilia- tion can be undertaken by adapting quality manage- ment practices to the target culture or by selectively implementing those quality management practices that would be more amenable to the target culture. Conversely, companies, through selective employee hiring or retention and organizational development initiatives, might be able to instill or adapt their own organizational cultures to be more supportive of quality management. Appendix A.
