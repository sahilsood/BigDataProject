THE CONSEQUENCES OF HUMAN RESOURCE STOCKS AND  FLOWS: A LONGITUDINAL EXAMINATION OF UNIT SERVICE  ORIENTATION AND UNIT EFFECTIVENESS  ROBERT E. PLOYHART  University of South Carolina  TEFF A. WEEKLEY  Kenexa  TASE RAMSEY  University of South Carolina  Drawing from resource-based theory, we argue for a broader interpretation of human  capital and demonstrate that unit service orientation contributes to unit effectiveness  over time. Operationalizing unit service orientation as the unit-level (n = 1,255)  aggregate of individual level (n = 114,198) service employee competencies, we mod-  eled the data over three quarters and found a positive but decreasing relationship  between the flow of unit service orientation and changes in unit effectiveness. Al-  though building a high-quality stock is important, we show that the key driver of  change in unit effectiveness is the flow of unit service orientation over time.  In the modern knowledge-based and service-ori-  ented economy, the success of many firms has  shifted from acquisition of tangible (physical) re-  sources to accumulation of intangible (human) re-  sources. "Human capital," defined as the unit-level  aggregate of individual knowledge, skills, and abil-  ities (KSAs), is theorized to be one of the most  critical resources for unit effectiveness (Barney &  Wright, 1998). Drawing primarily from the re-  source-based view of the firm (Barney, 1991) and  human capital theory (Becker, 1964), strategic hu-  man resource management (SHRM) scholarship  suggests that human resource (HR) practices con-  tribute to unit effectiveness because they build a  composition of human capital that is valuable, rare,  inimitable, and nonsubstitutable (Wright, Dunford,  & Snell, 2001). Human capital is therefore theo-  rized to create between-unit differences and, ulti-  mately, unit effectiveness.  The purpose of this study was to test several key  We thank Audrey Korsgaard, Ivey MacKenzie, Lynn  McFarland, Tom Moliterno, Matt Semadeni, and John  Slocum for helping or commenting on drafts of this arti-  cle.

We studied a large retail organization because  in this context, human capital is expected to influ-  ence unit effectiveness, yet there is considerable  variability in the stock and flow of human capital.  Consequently, our study provides important theo-  retical advances for the resource-based view,  SHRM scholarship, and the service literatures, as  well as new managerial implications for demon-  strating human resources' financial impact.  First, we operationalized human capital as unit  service orientation - the unit-level aggregate of in-  dividual employee service-orientation KSA scores.  Most SHRM research has not studied human capi-  tal directly but inferred its effects through HR prac-  tices or proxy measures (Gerhart, 2005; Wright &  Haggerty, 2005). Yet theoretically, it is the aggre-  gate of employee KSAs that is hypothesized to be  the source of unit effectiveness (Barney & Wright,  1998). Within the service literature, research has  shown that aggregates of employee climate percep-  tions or job attitudes relate to unit outcomes (see  Ryan and Ployhart [2003] and Schneider and White  [2004] for reviews), but these are not KSAs in the  sense that KSAs represent abilities or traits neces-  sary for job performance. Climate perceptions and  job attitudes are more relevant to perceptions of a  work environment and may or may not be neces-  sary for individual job performance.

Second, we provide critical tests of resource-  search has shown that there are positive returns on  individuals' investments in human capital (Becker,  1964), we have focused on the unit level; thus,  human capital is the aggregate of individual forms  of knowledge and experience and, as such, should  have unit-level consequences. There has been con-  siderable research in the economics and education  literatures supporting a link between aggregate hu-  man capital (operationalized as literacy rates,  school enrollment rates, teacher experience, and  years of education) and a variety of unit-level out-  comes (e.g., turnover rates, economic growth) (see  Aaronson, Barrow, & Sander, 2007; Lerner, 1983;  Sweetland, 1996).  based theory by demonstrating that changes in the  flow of unit service orientation relate to changes in  objective unit effectiveness over time. Past research  has emphasized stocks of human capital (i.e., the  relationship between human capital and unit out-  comes at a single point in time) but neglected con-  sideration of the flows of human capital (i.e., how  the stock of human capital changes over time) (Di-  erickx & Cool, 1989). One reason for the inimitabil-  ity of a resource is that its prior short- and long-  term histories make it path dependent, yet a  longitudinal focus remains largely neglected in the  SHRM literature. As Wright and Haggerty stated,  "Current theory exploring the relationship between  HRM and economic success has not deeply consid-  ered temporal issues. In most instances time is ei-  ther assumed as a constant, or considered in a  relatively shallow way" (2005: 166). This neglect is  noteworthy, because the flow of human capital is  necessary to ensure the resource manifests sus-  tained contributions to unit effectiveness. We pro-  pose that the longitudinal relationship between  unit service orientation and unit-level effectiveness  is positive but decreasing over time and that this  relationship is heterogeneous across units.  The resource-based view (Barney, 1991) argu-  ment is that units are heterogeneous in their re-  sources; between-unit differences in these re-  sources contribute to competitive advantage.  Human capital is one of several internal resources.  Yet, in contrast to human capital theory, the re-  source-based view gives more careful consideration  to different types of human capital. Human capital  is valuable when it contributes to a unit's core  capabilities. It contributes to competitive advan-  tage when it is also rare - that is, not equally held  by competitors; it may become a basis for sustained  competitive advantage if it is also inimitable; and it  may be inimitable because of the unit's path depen-  dency (performance trajectory over time) and  unique history (e.g., the business unit has been the  preferred employer and hence highly attractive to  applicants), causal ambiguity (uncertainty over  which specific combination of practices builds the  stock of human capital), or social complexity (in-  terpersonal relationships between coworkers, or  between coworkers and customers). An additional  requirement for sustainability is that human capital  may be nonsubstitutable with alternative resources  (Barney & Wright, 1998). Although there exists the  possibility of technological or process substitutes  for human capital exists (e.g., Bamberger & Meshu-  lam, 2000), there are also limits to the extent to  which human capital can be replaced. Note that the  resource-based view places emphasis not on spe-  Human capital theory comes from economics  cific HR practices, but on human capital itself. This  is an important distinction, because human capital  and articulates the value, consequences, and trans-  is an intangible resource and more difficult to im-  ferability of human capital at individual and aggre-  itate than specific HR practices (Wright et al.,  gated levels. Its central argument is that the acqui-  2001).  sition of both general and unit-specific human  capital contributes to individual and unit effective-  ness (Becker, 1964). Organizations that make in-  vestments in developing unit-specific human cap-  ital will (with sufficient retention) recover these  costs through increased productivity as their work-  forces acquire job-, organizational-, and industry-  specific knowledge (Strober, 1990). Although re-  In most SHRM scholarship, HR practices (e.g.,  staffing, training) are theorized to create a particu-  lar form of aggregate knowledge, skills, and abili-  ties (human capital), that in turn contribute to unit-  level outcomes (e.g., Barney & Wright, 1998).  Human capital is therefore a key explanatory mech-  anism from several theoretical perspectives.  Thus, a prediction based on both human capital  and resource-based theories is that it is the unit  aggregate of individual KSAs that leads to unit  effectiveness over time. In contrast, most empirical  research on strategic human resource management  infers human capital only from HR practices, proxy  measures, or informant self-reports (Wright et al.,  THEORY AND HYPOTHESES  The Structure of Human Capital Resources:  Putting People Back into Business Units This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:54:08 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  998 Academy of Management Journal October  Human Capital in Service Firms: Unit  Service Orientation  1991]). Among others, Gerhart has noted such lim-  itations of the extant literature and offered an  alternative:  [Researchers] need to include data from different  sources and levels of analysis (Bowen & Ostroff,  2004), given that HR system policies (often mea-  sured by asking HR executives) are typically theo-  rized to operate through individual level employee  reactions such as motivation, ability, and opportu-  nity. . . . Yet this multi-level/multi-source data (and  thus corresponding tests of intervening processes) is  largely absent. (2005: 177)  2001). 1 For example, Takeuchi et al. (2007) used  manager self-reports of their perceptions of em-  ployee performance as an index of human capital.  Informant or proxy measures are often necessary,  but they have two important limitations: First, be-  cause they are often based on a single manager's  perceptions, their construct validity is questionable  (in that common method bias, rater bias, and/or  inaccuracy may be present), and they may have low  reliability (Gerhart, 2005; Gerhart, Wright, Mc-  Mahan, & Snell, 2000). Second, HR practices and  proxy or informant measures prohibit an examina-  tion of within-unit variability and change over  time. When a single individual responds for an  entire business unit (e.g., a single HR manager re-  porting on employee skills), the assumption is that  One benefit of focusing directly on aggregate  all employees in the unit are equal on the charac-  KSAs is that it becomes possible to extend and  teristics being rated.

Because HR practices are forms of communica-  gested that other aggregate KSAs may also be im-  tion, employees vary in how well they understand,  portant, because they are linked to specific types of  perceive, and respond (i.e., within-unit variability  unit effectiveness in particular contexts.

Wright and Haggerty argued that "em-  recent suggestions for improving resource-based  ployee reactions are actually individual-level vari-  view research have proposed thinking first about  ables that are central to the proposed causal pro-  unit performance and then "working backwards" to  cess, yet are currently ignored in unit-level theories  of strategic HRM" (2005: 170).  identify the relevant sources of unit effectiveness  (Rouse & Daellenbach, 2002). Such suggestions are  consistent with HR scholarship showing that per-  they directly address the validity of empirical sup-  sonality and service orientation may be particularly  port for SHRM scholarship and the resource-based  valuable when major parts of a job involve social  view.

For example, if employees from  likely to be inimitable because it is socially com-  plex, causally ambiguous, and uniquely developed,  one firm deliver higher-quality service than com-  petitors, service orientation can be a determinant of  on the basis of a given firm's history (Barney, 1991;  Barney & Wright, 1998). If correct, then informant  unit effectiveness (Barney, 1991), even though ag-  self-report measures must be deficient because, by  gregate "service orientation" does not fit neatly into  definition, managers should not be able to ade-  the traditional definition of human capital. Wright  et al. (2001) emphasized the role of both aggre-  quately describe the human capital (i.e., it is caus-  ally ambiguous and socially complex [Barney,  gate ability and motivation as important determi-  nants of firm effectiveness, yet motivational con-  structs are typically excluded from human capital  definitions.  These limitations are not simply methodological;  1 It is also interesting to note that in many SHRM  studies, unit performance is likewise assessed with  proxy measures or informant self-reports (Carmeli &  Schaubroeck, 2005; Takeuchi, Lepak, Heli, & Takeuchi,  2007).  In keeping with this expanded perspective, Ploy-  hart, Weekley, and Baughman (2006) recently pre-  sented an alternative, broader operationalization of  human capital in service firms that is based on This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:54:08 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2009 Ployhart, Weekley, and Ramsey 999  to deliver service (Ployhart et al., 2006; Schneider  et al., 1998).  Thus, in our conceptualization the meaning of  aggregate personality. Drawing from multilevel the-  ory (Kozlowski & Klein, 2000), Ployhart et al.  (2006) demonstrated that job and organizational-  level personality were forms of human capital and  represented by the unit aggregate of individual per-  sonality KSA scores. They further showed how unit  differences in personality predicted individual ser-  vice performance and job satisfaction (see also  Schneider, Smith, Taylor, and Fleenor [1998]).  However, not all individual differences emerge  unit service orientation is similar to the meaning of  resources in the resource-based view and in SHRM.  Consequently, unit service orientation may contrib-  ute to unit effectiveness over time. First, as noted  above, it is a valuable and rare resource in service  firms. Second, it is difficult to imitate because unit-  level constructs are causally ambiguous and so-  cially complex. Barney and Wright stated, "Exploi-  tation of the synergistic value from a large number  of individuals who work together is quite costly if  not impossible for competitors to imitate" (1998:  39). Finally, as we discuss below, variability in the  longitudinal flow of unit service orientation makes  it difficult to copy (i.e., path dependency exists).  into theoretically relevant unit-level constructs that  may contribute to a unit's core capabilities. Such  aggregation is only meaningful to the extent that it  occurs for core employees and for the unit's core  competencies and capabilities (Lopez-Cabrales,  Valle, & Herrero, 2006; Prahalad & Hamel, 1990).  Core employees are those whose jobs are most cen-  tral to the existence of a firm (e.g., drivers in a  trucking firm, service providers in a retail store).  They perform the essential functions and tasks that  define the firm's existence. Core competencies are  those forms of human capital that core employees  must exhibit to contribute to the firm's strategy and  goals (i.e., they are valuable) (Lepak & Snell, 1999;  Prahalad & Hamel, 1990).  Although our operationalization of unit service  orientation is similar to that of Ployhart et al.  (2006), we extend their study in important ways.  First, our study is longitudinal and looks at both  the stock and flow of unit service-orientation accu-  mulation, whereas Ployhart et al. 's (2006) was  cross-sectional. Second, we assess the unit-level,  objective, financial consequences of unit service  orientation; Ployhart et al. only examined individ-  ual-level, subjective job performance evaluations  and self-reported job satisfaction. Finally, we ex-  amine unit service orientation, whereas Ployhart et  al. (2006) examined unit-level personality. These  are similar but not identical constructs. Service  orientation is typically the stronger determinant of  individual service performance (Hough & Schnei-  der, 1996) and is becoming the focus of modern  service research (Salvaggio, Schneider, Nishii,  Mayer, Ramesh, & Lyon, 2007).  In this study, we examined the unit service ori-  entation of frontline retail associates as an opera-  tionalization of human capital. The service sector is  the largest sector in private industry and represents  about 67.8 percent of the U.S. gross domestic prod-  uct (U.S. Department of Commerce, 2006, http://  www.commerce.gov). Retail associates are core em-  ployees because they are the largest group of  nonmanagerial employees involved in the provi-  sion of service (Delery & Shaw, 2001; Osterman,  1994). Unit service orientation is a valuable core  competency because it contributes directly to the  mission and goals of a retail organization (Lepak &  Snell, 1999; Schneider & White, 2004). We define  unit service orientation as a unit's aggregate, collec-  tive willingness and ability to deliver high-quality  service. However, the roots of unit service orienta-  tion lie at the individual level, because it is a mul-  tidimensional construct capturing individual dif-  ferences in willingness to treat customers with  respect and dignity, perceptiveness of customer  wants, and ability to communicate effectively and  manage impressions (Hogan, Hogan, & Busch,  1984; Schneider & Bowen, 1995). Individuals with  greater service orientation are more predisposed  and able to provide higher-quality service at the  individual level (Frei & McDaniel, 1998; Hogan et  al., 1984). Units with highly service-oriented indi-  viduals will have greater unit mean service orien-  tation (quality of human capital stock), thereby pro-  ducine interunit differences in collective capacity  A longitudinal perspective is necessary to test  whether unit service orientation leads to changes in  unit effectiveness over time, because it takes time  for unit-level resources to manifest unit-level  changes (Armstrong & Shimizu, 2007; Kozlowski &  Klein, 2000). This time dependency is particularly  important in the retail industry because of the high  turnover and volatility of talent (e.g., Kacmar, An-  drews, Rooy, Steilberg, & Cerone, 2006). However,  most SHRM research has been cross-sectional or  focused on static HR practices (Becker & Huselid,  2006; Gerhart, 2005; Wright & Haggerty, 2005).  There is surprisingly little evidence that human  resources contribute to unit effectiveness over time.  Becker and Huselid summarized the paucity of lon-  gitudinal research: "Unfortunately, this issue tends  The Stock and Flow of Unit Service Orientation  and Unit Effectiveness This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:54:08 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1000 Academy of Management Journal October  to typically receive a perfunctory mention in the  of resources is important for understanding their  Limitations section of most empirical articles and  consequences.

In particular,  unit service orientation and unit effectiveness.  they discussed the "bathtub" metaphor, in which  the amount of water in a tub represents the re-  source. The stock of the resource is represented by  the amount of water in the tub at any given time.  Importantly, there must be a critical mass of the  resource stock for it to influence unit effectiveness  (i.e., too little water in the tub makes it impossible  to get clean). The flows of the resource are repre-  sented by the water coming into the tub through the  faucet and out of the tub through the drain. Flows  influence the stock of a resource and whether a  critical mass is achieved and maintained. As Di-  erickx and Cool noted, "It takes a consistent pattern  of resource flows to accumulate a desired change in  strategic asset stocks" (1989: 1506). Thus, the stock  of a resource at a given time is important, but the  flows of the resource determine whether it pro-  duces a change in unit effectiveness.  According to human capital theory, it takes time  for investment in human capital to create positive  returns (Strober, 1990), as the generic forms of hu-  man capital must transfer into more firm-specific  knowledge and behaviors (e.g., going from general  knowledge of service provision to understanding  the unique customers of a specific firm). In the  resource-based view, time is vital because of the  sustainability aspect of strategic resources (Arm-  strong & Shimizu, 2007) and the fact that resources  are dynamic and have life cycles (Helfat & Peteraf,  2003). Valuable and rare resources may allow units  to be competitive, but this advantage will only be  sustainable if the resources are also inimitable  and/or nonsubstitutable (Barney, 1991). A key re-  quirement for inimitability is the path dependence  or prior history of the units' resources. Specifically,  business units follow trajectories that are in part  driven by their prior performance, unique relations  with the external environment (e.g., customers, lo-  cal economic conditions), and other internal re-  sources (e.g., managerial competence) (Barney,  1991). "Time compression diseconomies" among  resources suggest that competitors cannot develop  a resource to equal effectiveness under compressed  time (Dierickx & Cool, 1989). A good example is the  equity that a firm acquires from its reputation or  brand; it is not something easily copied or lost.  Trying to quickly build human capital is unlikely  to reproduce the same value it has for units in  which the capital has been established for a long  time because, in the latter case, the unit's workforce  should have more firm-specific and tacit knowl-  edge. Human capital may also help develop pro-  cess-dependent, network-based synergies.  important consequences for the study of unit  service orientation. First, units must establish a  critical mass (sufficient stock) of talented service  providers to influence unit effectiveness. Unfortu-  nately, we have probably all frequented retail es-  tablishments where it seemed employees were ei-  ther unable or unwilling to provide quality service.  Infusing such a unit with one or a few higher-  quality employees might marginally help, but the  unit would need to reach a sufficient stock of  above-average service provision to see above-aver-  age returns. Because service providers are core em-  ployees and influence customer behavior, not hav-  ing a sufficient stock of employees capable and  willing to provide quality service can lower effec-  tiveness (Schneider & White, 2004). Second, em-  ployees may choose to leave a firm or (to a degree)  withhold effort (Rouse & Daellenbach, 2002). Turn-  over is extremely high in retail positions (Kacmar et  al., 2006), so the flow (and hence stock) of unit  service orientation is likely to be highly variable  over time. Finally, even though HR may implement  the same practices, employees do not identically  perceive or adhere to the practices (Bowen & Os-  troff, 2004), thereby contributing to variability in  unit service orientation over time. For example,  even given the same selection practices, differences  in labor markets may enable one manager to hire  more selectively than another manager. By directly  measuring unit service orientation as the aggregate  of individual KSAs, it becomes possible to examine  The distinction between stocks and flows has  Although the resource-based view recognizes the  importance of time, several scholars have noted  that it is rather vague in specifying the kinds of  temporal dynamics that may occur among re-  sources (Armstrong & Shimizu, 2007; Helfat & Pe-  teraf, 2003). Research has not sufficiently ad-  dressed how changes in the accumulation of  resources influence changes in unit effectiveness  over time. Yet theory indicates that resources are  dynamic and evolving. As Helfat and Peteraf noted,  "The resource-based view must incorporate the  evolution over time of the resources and capabili-  ties that form the basis of competitive advantage"  (2003: 998). Thus, understanding the dynamicism This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:54:08 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2009 Ployhart, Weekley, and Ramsey 1001  the consequences of changes to the stock and flow  of human capital. We detail each of these points  below.  First, units that create higher stocks of unit ser-  vice orientation will perform better than units with  lower stocks because of employees* greater collec-  tive willingness and ability to manifest effective  service behaviors, including citizenship behaviors  and teamwork (Liao & Chuang, 2004; Ployhart et  al., 2006; Schneider, Ehrhart, Mayer, Saltz, & Niles-  Jolly, 2005). Such employees will be more likely to  identify customer preferences, adapt their behavior  to different types of customers, and generally be  more effective in influencing customer behavior  (Gwinner, Bitner, Brown, & Kumar, 2005; Liao &  Chuang, 2004). Higher-quality unit service orienta-  tion also increases the consistency of service deliv-  ery and contributes to greater customer satisfaction,  loyalty, repeat purchases, and positive word of  mouth (Liao & Chuang, 2004; Lovelock & Wirtz,  2004; Salvaggio et al., 2007). Employees with higher-  quality service orientation may also be more  likely to develop and share knowledge about cus-  tomers, products, and services (Dess & Shaw, 2001;  Ryan & Ployhart, 2003). Prior empirical research is  consistent with these expectations (Hitt, Bierman,  Shimizu, & Kochhar, 2001; Liao & Chuang, 2004;  Ployhart et al., 2006).  Second, although we expect the stock of unit  service orientation to be related to unit effective-  ness, it is the flow of unit service orientation over  time that should most influence change in unit  effectiveness (Dierickx & Cool, 1989). By merging  theory on resource life cycles (Helfat & Peteraf,  2003) with the empirical findings on customer ser-  vice, we propose that the longitudinal relationship  between unit service orientation and unit effective-  ness is positive but decreasing over time. That is,  we expect a tipping point at which unit service  orientation starts to produce diminishing (although  still positive) returns. We base this prediction on  the capability life cycle within the dynamic re-  source-based view (Helfat & Peteraf, 2003), which  is concerned with understanding the evolution of  resources and how they form, develop, and mature.  Importantly, the value of resources is expected to  change over time because of changes in the envi-  ronment and the "shelf life" of a resource itself.  Thus, in this perspective, the contribution of a re-  source toward unit effectiveness will not exhibit a  consistent effect (slope) over time. Rather, capabil-  ities and resources follow what Helfat and Peteraf  called an "experience" curve, because there are  "inherent limits to what any team could achieve  with available technologies, inputs, workers, and  state of managerial practice" (2003: 1002).  In line with this theory, customer service schol-  arship suggests that the flow of service orientation  into and out of the unit is likely to be highly vari-  able over time, thus affecting the nature of its rela-  tionship with unit effectiveness. High turnover in  retail jobs and the relative ease with which retail  employees may switch employers create consider-  able challenges for maintaining a consistent flow  and thus creation of a sufficient stock of quality  employees (Kacmar et al., 2006). The relationship  marketing literature has found that tremendous fi-  nancial benefits accrue when units establish long-  term relationships with customers, because it is  more profitable to keep existing customers than to  make new ones (Morgan & Hunt, 1994; Reichheld &  Sasser, 1990). Therefore, units able to maintain or  increase their flow of unit service orientation are  likely to increase the number of repeat customers  who are likely to shop more frequently, shop  longer, spread more positive word of mouth, and  purchase more on subsequent visits (Lovelock &  Wirtz, 2004; Reichheld & Sasser, 1990; Schneider et  al., 2005). Of course, increasing sales do not con-  tinue indefinitely, and as predicted by the capabil-  ity life cycle (Helfat & Peteraf, 2003), the relation-  ship (slope) between unit service orientation and  unit effectiveness will start to diminish (although  remaining positive). This diminishment results  from the fact that, unless a unit is going to provide  additional strategic investments (e.g., add person-  nel, increase store size, invest in new technology),  the effect of the resource will reach a tipping point  and start to weaken (Helfat & Peteraf, 2003). Thus,  the flow of unit service orientation will positively  relate to unit effectiveness because of increasing  subsequent sales, but there will also be a tipping  point at which the slope of unit service orientation  starts to weaken.  Hypothesis 1. The flow of unit service orienta-  tion over time relates to changes in unit effec-  tiveness, in such a way that the positive rela-  tionship gets weaker over time.  Finally, we expect between-unit heterogeneity in  the relationship between unit service orientation  and unit effectiveness: the longitudinal relation-  ship will be stronger for some units than others.  The resource-based prediction is that this heteroge-  neity occurs because the value of resources is con-  text-specific and cannot be separated from a unit's  unique history and distinctive relationships with  external and internal factors (Barney, 1991, 2001;  Helfat & Peteraf, 2003). First, resources are path  dependent, which means that the unit's specific  history and prior performance affect the subse-  quent flow and value of the resource (Barney, 2001; This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:54:08 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1002 Academy of Management Journal October  Hypothesis 2. The positive but decreasing unit  service orientation- unit effectiveness relation-  ship is heterogeneous across units. Units with  high-quality flows of unit service orientation  have greater effectiveness over time than  units with low-quality flows of unit service  orientation.  METHODS  Barney & Wright, 1998). Because different units  may be in different parts of the resource life cycle,  they might be in different parts of the curve; hence,  "The exact shape of the curve might differ" be-  tween units (Helfat & Peteraf, 2003: 1004). There-  fore, heterogeneity in the unit service orientation-  effectiveness relationship is in part affected by  prior flows of unit service orientation. Second, the  value of resources is heterogeneous because of the  unit's unique relationships with external and inter-  nal factors (Barney, 1991, 2001).

The jobs were in various depart-  ments (e.g., sporting goods, men's/women's cloth-  ing). All applicants completed the same selection  battery, because a job analysis and criterion-related  validity study indicated the same KSA require-  ments were present for effective service provision,  regardless of department.  Excluding 19 individuals who lacked demo-  graphic information, the sample was mostly female  (66%) and fairly diverse, including Native Ameri-  cans (0.98%), Asians (4.61%), African Americans  (21.87%), Caucasians (57.01%), and Hispanics  (15.52%). As in all retail samples, turnover was  high: over 75 percent of the sample quit during the  time period under investigation. Of those who quit,  the average length of employment was 58.09 days  (s.d. = 47.73). Individuals applied to one of 1,255  stores geographically distributed throughout all  states except Hawaii and Alaska. Our contacts at  the firm indicated the stores were largely equiva-  lent in products and services offered. Only stores  operating since 2002 were included (mean = 11  years, s.d. = 7.54 years).  organization used the Kenexa Retail Associate Se-  lector, a service-orientation battery containing  three personality traits (conscientiousness, agree-  ableness, and emotional stability) with 15 items  each, a 20-item "situational judgment" test (SJT),  and a 5-item biodata-based measure of educational  success. Prior research has suggested emotional sta-  bility, agreeableness, and conscientiousness are the  three main personality determinants of service ori-  entation (Frei & McDaniel, 1998; Hogan et al.,  1984). Situational judgment assesses knowledge of  appropriate service behaviors and ability to cor-  rectly perceive and respond to different service  encounters (not unlike tacit forms of service knowl-  edge). The SJT was developed using the critical-  incident technique, meaning that real work situa-  tions comprised the item stems. Applicants then  indicated which course of action they thought was  best/worst in each situation. The educational suc-  cess measure assessed academically related vari-  ables such as high school grade-point average  (GPA), highest grade completed, and number of  awards received. The overall predictor composite  was formed by summing the standardized scales,  and then converting the composite score to a T-  score. T-scores, standardized values that, with a  perfectly normal distribution, have a mean of 50  and a standard deviation of 10, are a frequently  used alternative to z-scores for removing the nega-  tive numbers for scores below the mean (see Nun-  nally & Bernstein, 1994).  In the criterion-related validity study conducted  with this organization, the personality subscales  demonstrated convergent (.60 and higher) and dis-  criminant (.31 and lower) validity with the Interna-  tional Personality Item Pool scales. Criterion-re-  lated validity (uncorrected) was .23 and nearly  identical to the .24 uncorrected meta-analytic esti-  mate reported by Frei and McDaniel (1998). The  composite internal consistency reliability was .81,  with subscale reliabilities ranging from .71 to .79,  except for the SJT, which was .47 (typical for SJTs,  especially for those with so few items; see Mc-  Daniel, Morgeson, Finnegan, Campion, and Braver-  man [2001]). Although the educational success  items may seem out of place, a job analysis indi-  cated they were necessary to assess basic reading  and quantitative skills for effective service provi-  sion (e.g., operating a cash register). Because we did  not have access to the item data, it was impossible  to examine whether their inclusion affected the  validity of the composite, although inclusion of  educational success is consistent with human cap-  ital theory (Strober, 1990).  Unit service orientation. We operationalized  unit service orientation as the store-level mean of  Procedures  All applicants were required to complete a basic  application form and service orientation predictor  on premises. Because of high turnover, the predic-  tor was used to screen out only the bottom 20  percent of the distribution. Applicants clearing this  hurdle were interviewed briefly by store staff; un-  fortunately, the interview scores were not captured  and were therefore unavailable to us. Because of  the relatively low cutoff score, high turnover, and  differences in local labor markets, there remained  plenty of room for interstore differences in unit  service orientation to emerge. We were provided  with predictor data obtained in the first three quar-  ters (as defined by the organization) of 2003: quar-  ter 1 (February 1-April 30); quarter 2 (May 1-July  31); quarter 3 (August 1-October 31). We obtained  store-level sales information from the organiza-  tion's archival data from quarter 2, 2002, to quarter  4, 2003.  Measures  Individual service orientation. We measured in-  dividual-level service orientation via a composite  assessing emotional stability, agreeableness, con-  scientiousness, educational success, and situa-  tional judgment (see Bettencourt, Gwinner, & Meu-  ter, 2001; Hogan et al., 1984; Paajanen, Hansen, &  McLellan, 1993).

Table 1 shows these and other descriptive  (Ployhart et al., 2006). In these studies (as in ours),  statistics for the store-level variables.  the level of theory for unit service orientation was  at the unit level but was measured with individual-  level KSAs. There were three repeated measures of  unit service orientation (quarters 1, 2, 3) for each  store. Each quarterly score was the mean service  orientation score of all individuals who had ap-  plied to and were working at a store in a particular  quarter. For example, an applicant who was hired  in quarter 1 and quit in quarter 3 would have con-  tributed to his/her store's unit service orientation  score for quarters 1,2, and 3. An applicant hired in  quarter 2 who quit in quarter 2 would have contrib-  uted only to that quarter. Thus, an individual's  service orientation score could contribute to a  store's unit service orientation score for one to  three quarters - an appropriate result, given our fo-  cus on unit-mean levels of service orientation.2  Unit effectiveness. We used store productivity,  profit, and percentage of sales growth as operation-  alizations of unit effectiveness because they have  theoretical importance and relevance to service con-  texts, and their use ensures our findings were not  metric-specific (the findings between these measures,  raw sales, and other variations of sales were nearly  identical). We measured all criteria from quarter 2,  2003, through quarter 1, 2004.  The first criterion was sales per employee. Ser-  vice firms frequently use this measure as an index  of productivity, and it has been frequently used in  past research (e.g., Huselid, 1995). We calculated  sales per employee by taking the store's quarterly  sales and dividing it by the average number of  relevant employee positions for 2003 (provided by  the firm). Consequently, calculation of sales per  employee was unaffected by turnover because even  though there may have been high levels of turn-  over, the number of positions stayed highly consis-  tent over the year.  The second criterion was adjusted controllable  profit. Controllable profit represents a store's quar-  terly sales minus quarterly costs that are, to an  extent, under the control of the staff (e.g., labor,  utilities). It represents an index of profitability that  the store management can be expected to have  some control over (and for which they are held  accountable). This index has been used by Sacco  and Schmitt (2005). However, the studied firm did  not want us to present raw values, so we adjusted  the controllable profit figures by multiplying them  by a decimal constant. This adjustment reduced the  controllable profit numbers in consistent ways  through all three quarters but had absolutely no  effect on distributions, significance tests, standard  errors, or the form of relationships (Aiken & West,  1991).  The final store-level criterion was a measure of  percentage of sales growth for each store, another  commonly used index of retail store effectiveness  (Batt, 2002). Often called same store sales, it esti-  mates change (expressed as a percentage) in quar-  terly sales relative to the store's performance in the  same quarter of the prior year. The measure essen-  tially uses each store as its own control variable,  helping to minimize the effects of between-store  differences. This capacity is important theoretically,  Bliese (2000) noted that when an individual-  level measure is not designed to measure a shared  perception (e.g., unit climate), the critical issue is  demonstrating sufficient reliability for the unit-  level measure. Such was the case here, because the  individual-level measure assessed individual dif-  ferences rather than some common referent such as  unit climate or group efficacy (agreement would be  necessary for establishing aggregation in the latter  case; see Kozlowski and Klein [2000]). Bliese ar-  gued that in such instances, the critical issue for  testing emergence is not agreement but rather, find-  ing sufficient reliability for the aggregate unit-level  means: "The key to detecting emergent relation-  ships is to have groups large enough to produce  reliable group-mean values - that is, high ICC(2)  values" (2000: 373). Therefore, ICC(2) values for  unit service orientation must exceed the .70 mini-  mum threshold. The ICC(2) values for unit service  orientation were .87. Although not critical for ag-  gregation in our case, we followed the ICC(l) pro-  cedure suggested by Bliese and Ployhart (2002) to  estimate the amount of between-store variance in  the service orientation scores for all three quarters.  2 Although assigning a unit mean score to represent  employees' scores is in some ways similar to having a  manager provide a self-report to represent a unit, the unit  mean is likely to be more reliable and is based on the  actual aggregate human capital instead of a perceptual  estimate of that capital.

Hence,  using the same-store-sales criterion produces a very  strong internal control. The calculation of same  store sales is quarterly sales minus quarterly sales  for the prior year divided by the quarterly sales for  the prior year. For example, for quarter 3, 2003,  same store sales is calculated as [sales quarter 3,  2003 - sales quarter 3, 2002)/ sales quarter 3, 2002.  + [Aunit service orientation)  + [Aunit service orientation)2.  Unit-level control variables. We used seven  control variables to hold constant potential store-  level and economic influences. We calculated store  size by the average headcount of all frontline retail  store employees for 2003; store age was the number  of days the store was open. We obtained the 2003  unemployment rate for each store's zip code from  the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The per capita  income (PCI) for each zip code (cf. Sacco & Schmitt,  2005) was obtained by linking the zip code from  each store to U.S. Census Bureau databases. Per  capita income allowed us to control for whether  stores located in wealthier locations showed higher  sales. We used retail density to estimate the amount  of retail competition facing a store. It was created  by merging a Census Bureau database containing  the number of retail establishments per square mile  in each zip code with our store data. Store turnover  represents the average annual turnover rate in a  store for the year (0 = "no turnover"), and tenure  summarizes the average length of employment for  employees in a given store.  Levels of Analysis and Analytic Strategy  The data for this study are longitudinal and  nested, such that we are modeling interstore differ-  ences in intrastore relationships between unit ser-  vice orientation and effectiveness. Consequently, it  was appropriate to use a random coefficient growth  model (RCGM). We built and tested the RCGM us-  ing procedures outlined in Bliese and Ployhart  (2002). However, unlike growth models in which  the independent variable is a time trend (e.g., lin-  ear, quadratic), our RCGM capitalizes on the repeat-  edly measured unit service orientation scores. That  is, the independent variable is not time but flows  (changes) in unit service orientation over time. Spe-  cifically, we used a model in which the repeatedly  measured store sales criteria (sales per employee,  adjusted controllable profit, same store sales) were  regressed upon the control variables (measured at a  single point in time) and the repeatedly measured  unit service orientation measure. The intrastore  (level 1) model can be conceptually illustrated as:  In this model, the dependent variable is change in  the sales criteria, and the regression weights are  estimates of whether changes in unit service orien-  tation lead to positive (but decreasing) changes in  store sales criteria over time (i.e., intrastore changes  over time). Note that these regression weights rep-  resent the average curve for all stores. The inter-  store (level 2) model uses variance components to  estimate between-store heterogeneity among the in-  tercept and slopes. These variance components  represent the variability in the positive but decreas-  ing relationship across stores.  Hypothesis 1 was tested via the statistical signif-  icance of the regression weights for the unit service  orientation terms. To support a nonlinear (positive  but decreasing) curve, not only did both terms  have to be significant, but also, the change in unit  service orientation term had to be positive and the  change in unit service orientation-squared term  had to be negative. Hypothesis 2 was tested via the  statistical significance of the variance component  terms for unit service orientation and unit service  orientation squared (we modeled the intercept vari-  ance as well, but it was not part of any hypothesis  test). Note that the variance component for the lin-  ear unit service orientation term estimates variabil-  ity in the general strength of the linear trend, and  the variance component for the squared unit ser-  vice orientation term estimates variability in the  inflection (or "bend") in the curve. Jointly, these  variance components test whether the positive but  decreasing relationship differs across stores. Be-  cause both the linear and squared unit service ori-  entation terms had to be significant to support Hy-  pothesis 1, so too must both variance components  be significant to support Hypothesis 2. Hence, Hy-  pothesis 1 tests the shape of the average curve, and  Hypothesis 2 tests whether there is between-store  variability in the shape of the curve.  Modeling unit service orientation in this way is  known as using time-varying predictors (see Singer  & Willett, 2003). As Singer and Willett noted, it is  important to include a time lag between predictors  and criteria when the time-varying predictor is  nonmonotonic. Therefore, we set up the model so  that the store sales criteria followed unit service  orientation temporally by one quarter. Unit service  orientation in quarter 1 predicts sales in quarter 2;  unit service orientation in quarter 2 predicts sales  in quarter 3; unit service orientation in quarter 3 This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:54:08 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2009 Ployhart, Weekley, and Ramsey 1007  est to the variance diagonal are larger than bands of  covariances farther from the variance diagonal.  predicts sales in quarter 4. Note that an added  benefit of using a lagged model is stronger infer-  ences of causality, because unit service orientation  precedes unit outcomes by one quarter (Singer &  Willett, 2003). We do not claim this modeling  proves causality, but it does allow for stronger  causal inferences because it temporally separates  the predictors from the criteria. This is not a differ-  ence-score model; instead, it is a model that re-  gresses change in effectiveness onto change in unit  service orientation.  RESULTS  We entered the control variables first for all anal-  yses, standardized because of their vastly different  variances. The one exception was turnover rate,  because it only ranged from 0 to 1; hence, 0 has a  meaningful interpretation (i.e., no turnover). Unit  service orientation was the unit mean of individual  scores, which were already standardized via  T-scores. We did not further standardize it because  doing so could have biased estimates of longitudi-  nal relationships (e.g., Rovine & von Eye, 1991). A  Toeplitz band- diagonal residual matrix was used  to model correlations among the residuals in all  models. This type of residual matrix is like a sim-  plex matrix in which the covariances among resid-  uals are estimated in bands, so that the bands clos-  Descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1. No-  tice that unit service orientation and the sales cri-  teria appear to be unrelated. We caution readers  against making such inferences because aggregate  means and bivariate correlations can mask the  within- and between-unit variance in longitudinal  models (Rogosa, 1995). We emphasize this "lack"  of relationships only to highlight the critical differ-  ence between the stock and flow of unit service  orientation. Also note that, although variability in  unit service orientation decreases over time, this  effect is not, to our knowledge, to the result of any  intervention or change within the organization's  policies and practices.

These analyses regressed unit effec-  tiveness onto the control variables, then the unit  service orientation mean, and finally the linear and  quadratic unit service orientation terms. In none of  these models was the regression coefficient for the  mean of unit service orientation statistically signif-  icant. Alternatively, in each model the linear and  quadratic terms were always statistically signifi-  cant [p < .05) and, on the basis of the Xu (2003)  procedure noted above, explained significant incre-  mental variance (ranging from 2 percent to 7.40  percent). These supplemental analyses provided  additional support for the proposition that unit ser-  vice orientation flows, and not simply unit service  orientation stock, are related to changes in unit  effectiveness.  orientation as the dependent variable and the sales  criteria as the independent variables. These analy-  ses were also lagged by one quarter. There was no  evidence for reverse causation because none of the  regression weights was statistically significant (p >  .20). We also examined whether the results  changed by removing the one-quarter lag, so that  unit service orientation and unit sales were at the  same quarter. The conclusions were identical to the  lagged findings (these results are available upon  request). As noted by a reviewer, this correspon-  dence of results may suggest that unit service ori-  entation can manifest effects on unit effectiveness  in very short periods of time (i.e., less than one  quarter). Conversely, the consequences of decreas-  ing unit service orientation are also likely to occur  very quickly and possibly in an accelerated man-  ner. Thus, although we saw the effects of unit ser-  vice orientation extending to at least one quarter,  our nonlagged findings suggest that these effects  may occur in less time than one quarter.  Hypothesis 2 predicts that the positive, but de-  creasing, unit service orientation- unit effective-  ness relationship is heterogeneous among units,  with units manifesting consistently high flows of  unit service orientation having greater effectiveness  than those with consistently low flows of unit ser-  vice orientation. The between-store variance com-  ponents in Table 2 provide general support for this  hypothesis. There was significant heterogeneity for  both unit service orientation variance components  for adjusted controllable profit and sales per em-  ployee. For these two criteria, the positive but de-  creasing relationship with unit service orientation  differed across stores. However, for same store  sales, only the linear variance component was sig-  nificant, suggesting that there were only between-  unit differences in the linear part of the slope (i.e.,  there was variability in the linear trend). In general,  even when the same HR practices were used in all  units, variability in the longitudinal linear relation-  ship between unit service orientation and unit ef-  fectiveness was considerable. Unfortunately, there  are no conventions as to what constitutes small or  large effect sizes for variance components, so we  instead illustrate the practical consequences of this  heterogeneity. Specifically, we expected that stores  with consistently higher flows of unit service ori-  entation would "outperform" stores with lower  flows. As an illustration, stores with consistent  flows of higher unit service orientation (1 s.d.  above the mean) increased their sales per employee  by $4,000.00 more per quarter than stores with  lower flows of unit service orientation (1 s.d. below  the mean). Hypothesis 2 was therefore supported  for the adjusted controllable profit and sales per  employee criteria.  We conducted additional analyses to examine  evidence of other forms of causation. We first ex-  amined reverse causation by placing unit service  DISCUSSION  The expectation that human resources contribute  to a unit's effectiveness is a cornerstone of both  macro (e.g., resource-based theory) and micro (HR,  psychology) disciplines of management scholar-  ship. Those in the field of strategic human resource  management seek to connect these levels and artic-  ulate how human resources relate to firm effective-  ness. The purpose of this study was to test several  critical, but largely neglected, predictions of re-  source-based view and SHRM scholarship to dem-  onstrate how changes in the stock and flow of unit  service orientation contribute to changes in objec-  tive indexes of unit effectives.  First, following recent recommendations (e.g.,  Gerhart, 2005; Rouse & Daellenbach, 2002), we ar-  gued for an expanded interpretation of human cap-  ital, one based on aggregate knowledge, skills, and  abilities theoretically linked to unit effectiveness in  specific contexts. We found that a retail unit's ser-  vice orientation represents a resource capable of  producing change in unit effectiveness. Our exam-  ination of unit service orientation provides a nice  complement to prior service research, which has  focused on employee job attitudes and climate per-  ceptions (Schneider et al., 1998). Importantly, unit  service orientation is not based on inferences from  HR practices or proxy measures, but is measured  directly via the aggregation of employee KSAs. Be-  sides being more consistent with the underlying  theory of a strategic resource, direct measures of  aggregate KSAs may offer additional benefits, such  as better reliability and construct validity (Gerhart, This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:54:08 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1010 Academy of Management Journal October  sales essentially controls for a store's prior perfor-  2005; Wright & Haggerty, 2005).

Ex-  amining human capital in this manner may contrib-  ute to better measures of "intangible resources" and  help illuminate the "black box" that plagues SHRM  research (Becker & Huselid, 2006).  Finally, we found that the relationship between  the flow of unit service orientation and unit effec-  tiveness was positive but decreasing over time and  heterogeneous among units. Drawing on the re-  source life cycle (Helfat & Peteraf, 2003) and prior  customer-service research (e.g., Liao & Chuang,  2004; Lovelock & Wirtz, 2004; Mattila, 2001;  Schneider et al., 2007), we argued that units with  flows of higher-quality unit service orientation will  generate more new customers and more repeat cus-  tomers, who will shop more frequently and pur-  chase more on subsequent visits. This cycle creates  a positive but decreasing relationship between unit  service orientation and unit effectiveness, because  sales are likely to accelerate to a tipping point, and  then start to weaken (yet remain positive) (Reich-  held & Sasser, 1990). Of course, we did not find  significant heterogeneity for the squared term with  the same-store-sales criterion. Because same store  This study offers several new directions for re-  source-based theory. One key implication is that  although accumulating a high-quality stock of hu-  man resources is important for increasing unit ef-  fectiveness, it is even more important to control the  flow of talent (Barney & Wright, 1998; Wright et al.,  2001). This finding provides some preliminary sup-  port for recent theory predicting resources and ca-  pabilities are dynamic, and perhaps even for the This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:54:08 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2009 Ployhart, Weekley, and Ramsey 1011  idea that a resource cannot be a source of sustained  competitive advantage without additional inputs  (Helfat & Peteraf, 2003). That is, without continual  reinvestment in or renewal of the resource, it will  eventually cease to be a source of competitive ad-  vantage. Recognizing the importance of resource  flows requires future research to study how re-  sources are created and evolve over time. For ex-  ample, it becomes critical to understand which HR  practices most influence flow in the quickest and  most efficient manner. Understanding resource  emergence is critical for testing resource-based the-  ory in a prescriptive manner (Helfat & Peteraf,  2003).  The fact that unit service orientation manifests a  positive but decreasing relationship with unit out-  comes, and that this relationship is largely hetero-  geneous among units, also stimulates many re-  search questions. For example, if the flow of  resources manifests nonlinear relationships with  unit outcomes, then it becomes important to under-  stand why the relationship is nonlinear, and  whether other resources manifest similar nonlinear  relationships. In our study, we expected positive  but decreasing sales over time, because firms with  higher-quality human resource flows produce more  satisfied customers that shop more and spend more  money (Lovelock & Wirtz, 2004; Reichheld &  Sasser, 1990; Schneider et al., 2005). Obviously, the  nonlinear function may differ across types of re-  sources and contexts. For example, human re-  sources may show weaker slopes in industries  dominated by more tangible forms of capital (e.g.,  manufacturing), but may show stronger slopes in  industries where there is a more intimate relation-  ship between service providers and customers (e.g.,  law firms). Likewise, the lag between the time  when the resource reaches a high-quality stock and  the time when changes in unit effectiveness occur  may be resource and context specific. Barney  (1991) argued that strategic resources are context-  specific and dependent on the unit's strategy,  which helps explain the heterogeneity in unit ser-  vice orientation- unit effectiveness relationships  we observed. Integrating context and strategy with  human resources could prove to be very interest-  ing. For example, one may question whether the  generalizable relationships found for KSA predic-  tors of individual-level performance would be  generalizable at the unit level. Similarly, future  research should examine why there was heteroge-  neity in the positive but decreasing unit service  orientation-unit effectiveness relationship. Such  heterogeneity may be caused by differences in  units' strategies, their ability to leverage the capital  or combine it with other resources, managerial  practices, and related internal factors (e.g., Barney,  1991). Indeed, managers who better recognize the  strategic value of unit human capital are more  likely to leverage it and hence extract more value  more from it (Carmeli & Schaubroeck, 2005; Hitt et  al., 2001). Alternatively, heterogeneity may be due  to external reasons, such as a unit's reputation and  brand equity, local competition, and similar con-  textual factors.  Finally, this study has implications for the cus-  tomer service literature because most prior unit-  level service research has focused on either shared  employee attitudes and perceptions or manager  competencies (see Schneider & White, 2004). Ne-  glected in this literature is the actual aggregate  competence of a service unit's workforce - a strik-  ing area of neglect, considering that service em-  ployees are core employees and fulfill key "bound-  ary-spanning" roles (Batt, 2002). Research should  now consider how aggregate service orientation,  attitudes, climate, satisfaction, and sales are re-  lated. For example, climates not supportive of ser-  vice may nullify the positive potential of unit ser-  vice orientation, because service behaviors are not  perceived to be valued.  Of course, not all human resources will be as  volatile as those in the retail industry, and we  would not expect human resources to always relate  to unit effectiveness. For example, in industries  that are less affected by human capital, such as  agriculture and manufacturing, human resources  may be more substitutable. The human capital-  unit effectiveness relationship may also be stronger  or weaker under different types of HR configura-  tions (e.g., Bamberger & Meshulam, 2000) or differ-  ent jobs. Similarly, retail firms could choose to use  process-based strategies in an attempt to replace  human capital (see Bamberger & Meshulam, 2000).  We remind readers that enhancing human capital is  not free. There are costs associated with acquiring  and retaining human capital, and utility models are  helpful for understanding these costs (Sturman,  Trevor, Boudreau, & Gerhart, 2003).  Managerial Implications  Many in the retail industry are skeptical about  the value of investing in frontline service employ-  ees. The argument is that with high turnover and  few apparent differences among applicants, HR  should simply use the "cheapest way of getting  warm bodies." Such is the "value challenge" facing  HR more generally (Barney & Wright, 1998). The  present study offers an empirical response to such  criticism. First, it presents an alternative way to  estimate unit service orientation's value to a firm This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:54:08 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1012 Academy of Management Journal October  talent or customers) may have exerted influences in  by demonstrating the relationships at the unit level,  ways we could not assess.  on which most managers focus, and by linking it to  Second, although the stores used identical HR  the kinds of criteria managers attend to and are  practices, and managers were expected to imple-  held accountable for (Ployhart, 2006).

One might argue that  directly studying employee KSAs is a potentially  useful way to assess the consistency between HR  policies and practices, as well as address other  issues with self-reports (see Arthur & Boyles, 2007;  Gerhart, 2005; Gerhart et al., 2000), although this is  a question for future research.  Thus, the practical implications of this study are  much more than simply noting that unit service  orientation is important. One key implication is  that organizations should strive to develop and  maintain a critical mass of high unit service orien-  tation. Applying an HR practice from the "high-  performance work system" bundle is not enough;  managers must monitor and evaluate the practice's  consequences at the unit level. Sustainable compet-  itive advantage may come not from the use of a  particular HR practice, but from management's  ability to effectively apply the practice (in coordi-  nation with relevant dynamic labor conditions) to  accumulate and maintain a stock of talented em-  ployees. As this study shows, considerable vari-  ability can exist even within the same firm. Man-  agers must realize it will take time for unit service  orientation to emerge and produce unit-level  effects.  Third, we modeled unit service orientation for  jobs of relatively low complexity, and within a  service environment. Theoretically, one might pre-  dict similar results in other industries and for other  types of constructs (e.g., cognitive ability), but the  fact remains that until such data are available, one  should be cautious about generalizing our findings  to different contexts, jobs, and KSAs. Fourth, we  were only able to analyze the overall service-orien-  tation composite. Because the organization did not  use the subscales for selection, we were unable to  examine whether these different KSAs might have  had different relationships with store sales (e.g.,  conscientiousness may have exhibited different re-  lationships than agreeableness). However, please  recognize that the service-orientation composite  was assessed in a manner consistent with prior  research, the items were chosen to measure the  service-orientation composite, and the cut score  was based on the composite. Fifth, we were not  able to capture interview scores or identify whether  interviewers considered the service-orientation  scores when making hiring decisions (although all  applicants had to participate in both assessments).  That said, the key issue for the present study is  demonstrating whether changes in unit service ori-  entation relate to changes in unit effectiveness, so  between-store variability in interviewer practices  Limitations  Such a large longitudinal field study offers sev-  eral challenges, and our approach has limitations  that should be addressed in future research. First,  our study was conducted within a single industry  and firm. Even with seven control variables, we  cannot eliminate the possibility that some stores  differed from others in ways we could not model.  Relatedly, our use of stores that varied in naturally  occurring ways (no extreme groups) and all used  the same HR practices may have resulted in con-  servative tests of our hypotheses, and we urge other  researchers to replicate our study with different  samples, industries, methods, and contexts. Doing  so is particularly important, because unmeasured  variables may account for some of our findings. For  example, we had to use a rough measure of retail  density, yet various forms of retail competition (for This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:54:08 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2009 Ployhart, Weekley, and Ramsey 1013  Barney, }.

Sixth, although  the study was longitudinal, the data were only  modeled over a three-quarter period. This period is  longer than that used in most prior research, but it  would be helpful to examine even longer time  frames. Including the predictors in the quarter prior  to the criterion strengthens inferences of causality,  but stronger inferences of causality require longer  periods of time. Future research should test differ-  ent lags between unit resources and unit effective-  ness using different types of resources, contexts,  and data. Too long or too short a lag may obscure  dynamic relationships. Studying issues relating to  the duration and timing of unit resource effects  would provide great precision in understanding  how resources contribute to unit effectiveness and  enhance knowledge of the resource life cycle (Hel-  fat & Peteraf, 2003). Finally, we modeled employ-  ees as being part of a unit's service orientation,  even if they worked only a short period of time.  Future research might benefit from finer-grained  analysis of the relationship between length of em-  ployment and human capital's consequences.  Becker, G. S. 1964.

In conclusion, this study presents important ev-  idence that unit service orientation can be a deter-  minant of unit effectiveness. We believe a more  direct focus on human capital operationalized as  aggregate KSAs may connect micro and macro dis-  ciplines and levels of scholarship. Human capital is  critical to the effectiveness of business units, firms,  and even nations. It is incumbent on scholars in all  disciplines to better understand the creation and  consequences of this vital resource.  REFERENCES  Aaronson, D., Barrow, L., & Sander, W. 2007.
