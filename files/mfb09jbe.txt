This study assesses the causal relationship between corporate social performance (CSP) and financial performance (FP). We perform our empirical analyses on a sample of 179 publicly held Canadian firms and use the measures of CSP provided by Canadian Social Investment Database for the years 2004 and 2005. Using the ‘‘Granger causality’’ approach, we find no significant relationship between a composite measure of a firm’s CSP and FP, except for market returns. However, using individual measures of CSP, we find a robust significant negative impact of the environmental dimension of CSP and three measures of FP, namely return on assets, return on equity, and market returns. This latter finding is consistent, at least in the short run, with the trade-off hypothesis and, in part, with the negative synergy hypothesis which states that socially responsible firms experience lower profits and reduced shareholder wealth, which in turn limits the socially responsible investments. KEY WORDS: corporate social performance, ﬁnancial performance, causality, environmental activities Introduction academic researchers and Business ethics in Canada has been shaped by dif- ferent players: Canadian society in general, activism from religious groups and other institutional or ethical investors. In addition, the growing interest of the Canadian accounting profession has also facilitated its devel- opment (Brooks, 1997). Furthermore, the intro- Investment duction Database (CSID) developed by Michael Jantzi Research Associates (MJRA) provides researchers with a new and improved means to quantify cor- in Canada and porate social performance (CSP) the Canadian Social of to increased research efforts leads (Mahoney and Roberts, 2004). in this area ‘‘CSP research has employed a variety of theories and methodologies to study the potential relation- ship between corporate social responsibility activi- ties and other traditional measures of a ﬁrm’s success’’ (Mahoney and Roberts, 2007, p. 234). In addition to large-scale American empirical research, some researchers have examined the relationship between CSP and ﬁnancial performance (FP) in other contexts including the Canadian context. Contrary to the US study by Waddock and Graves (1997); Mahoney and Roberts (2007) found no signiﬁcant relationship between a composite mea- sure of CSP and FP for Canadian ﬁrms. However, their ﬁndings do indicate a signiﬁcant relationship between individual measures of a ﬁrm’s CSP regarding environmental and international activities and FP. This study examined only one direction of causality, i.e. from CSP to FP. The purpose of this paper is to assess the causal relationship between the ﬁrm’s CSP and FP, using the Granger causality approach (Granger, 1969). As in Mahoney and Roberts (2007), our results do not show a consistent statistically signiﬁcant relationship between the aggregate measure of a ﬁrm’s CSP and all FP measures. However, contrary to this Canadian study, our ﬁndings do suggest a signiﬁcant negative impact of the environmental dimension of CSP on FP. High ratings of social performance in terms of environmental activities ‘‘Granger causes’’ lower levels of ﬁnancial performance. Our ﬁndings are robust to three measures of performance, ROA, ROE and stock market returns and to the inclusion of several control variables that are known to have an impact on CSP and FP. 410 Rim Makni et al. Our contribution to the literature on CSP is twofold. First, our paper extends prior large-scale American studies of causality between CSP and FP, by utilizing data on publicly held Canadian ﬁrms. Second, our study is the ﬁrst to investigate the causality links between CSP and FP in Canada. The remainder of the paper is organized as fol- lows. In the next section, we examine the ‘‘Theo- retical framework’’ regarding the CSP-FP link. The third section describes our ‘‘Research methodol- ogy’’. In the fourth section, we present the ‘‘results’’ of the study, followed by the ‘‘Conclusions’’ in the last section. Theoretical framework Literature review Preston and O’Bannon (1997) have distinguished between the direction of the CSP-FP relationship (positive, negative or neutral) and the causal sequence: does CSP inﬂuence FP, does FP inﬂuence CSP, or is there a synergistic relationship between the two? They have developed six possible causal and directional hypotheses: social impact hypothesis, slack resources hypothesis, trade-off hypothesis, managerial opportunism hypothesis, positive synergy hypothesis and negative synergy hypothesis. The social impact hypothesis is based on the stakeholder theory which suggests that meeting the needs of various corporate stakeholders will lead to favourable FP (Freeman, 1984). According to this hypothesis, stake- holders enhances a company’s reputation in a way that has a positive impact on its FP. Conversely, disappointing these groups of stakeholders may have a negative ﬁnancial impact (Preston and O’Bannon, 1997). serving the implicit claims of The slack resource hypothesis predicts that better FP potentially results in the availability of slack resources that may increase a ﬁrm’s ability to invest in socially responsible domains such as community and society, employee relations or environment (Waddock and Graves, 1997). The trade-off hypothesis supposes a negative impact of CSP on FP. This hypothesis deals with the neoclassical economists’ position which holds that socially responsible behaviour will net few economic beneﬁts while its numerous costs will reduce proﬁts and shareholder wealth (Waddock and Graves, 1997). ‘‘This hypothesis reﬂects the classic Friedman position and is supported by the well-known early ﬁnding of Vance (1975) that corporations displaying strong social credentials experience declining stock prices relative to the market average’’ (Preston and O’Bannon, 1997, p. 421). to According the managerial opportunism hypothesis, corporate managers may pursue their own private objectives to the detriment of both shareholders and other stakeholders (Weidenbaum and Sheldon, 1987; Williamson, 1967, 1985). In fact, when FP is strong, managers may reduce social expenditures in order to maximize their own short- term private gains. Conversely, when FP weakens, managers may engage in conspicuous social pro- grams in order to offset their disappointing results (Preston and O’Bannon, 1997). reinvestment the possibility of The positive synergy hypothesis supposes that higher levels of CSP lead to an improvement of FP, which offers in socially responsible actions (Allouche and Laroche, 2005a). Indeed, favourable CSP leads to a surplus of available funds (social impact hypothesis) which is reallocated, to the different stakeholders (slack resources hypothesis). There may then be a simultaneous relation between CSP and FP, forming a virtuous circle (Waddock and Graves, 1997). interactive in part, and positive However, according to the negative synergy hypothesis, higher levels of CSP lead to decreased FP, which in turn limits the socially responsible investments. There may then be a simultaneous and interactive negative relation between CSP and FP, forming a vicious circle. While empirical results concerning the nature of the relationship between CSP and FP continue to be mixed, the largest number of investigations found a positive relationship. This the positivism of the CSP-FP link is supported by sub- sequent meta-analysis and Laroche, 2005b; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wu, 2006). tendency towards (Allouche Another vein of research focused on the causal relationship between CSP and FP. For instance, using traditional statistical techniques, Waddock and Graves (1997) and Hillman and Keim (2001) ﬁnd a positive synergistic relationship between CSP and FP showing the existence of a virtuous circle Causality Between Corporate Social Performance and Financial Performance 411 between the two constructs. McGuire et al. (1988) ﬁnd that lagged FP measures lead to improved cur- rent CSP measures, but the latter does not affect FP. In a more recent study, Nelling and Webb (2006) examine the causal relationship between CSP and FP by introducing a new econometric technique, the Granger causality approach. Their ﬁndings suggest that, using ordinary least square (OLS) regression models, CSP and FP are related. In disagreement with prior empirical research, they ﬁnd a lower relationship between CSP and FP when employing a time series ﬁxed effects approach. The same result is found when introducing Granger causality models. Furthermore, by focusing on individual measures of CSP, they ﬁnd causality running from stock market performance to CSP ratings regarding employee’s relationships. studies, Mahoney and Roberts In addition to those large-scale American empiri- (2007) have cal examined the relationship between CSP and FP in the Canadian context. This study has examined the relationship between these constructs using the CSID measure of CSP.1 Contrary to Waddock and Graves (1997), Mahoney and Roberts (2007) found no sig- niﬁcant relationship between a composite measure of a ﬁrm’s CSP and FP. However, using a one-year lag, their ﬁndings indicate a signiﬁcant positive relation- ship between individual measures of a ﬁrm’s CSP regarding environmental and international activities and FP. This study has examined only one direction of causality: from CSP to FP. Conceptual model Past research falls short of showing a clear causal relationship between FP and CSP. Our study aims at testing the following hypothesis by using the Gran- ger causality approach, and by considering exoge- nous factors that could mitigate this relationship: H1: Higher (lower) levels of ﬁnancial performance (corporate social performance) Granger cause higher (lower) levels of corporate social per- formance (ﬁnancial performance). Figure 1 illustrates our conceptual model. The fol- lowing CSP dimensions are assessed in an aggregate CSP score and individually: community and society, corporate governance, customers, employees, environment and human rights. Financial performance is measured by two accounting ratios, ROA and ROE and stock market returns. Control variables that are known to have an impact on CSP and FP, namely size, risk and industry, are included in the statistical models to better isolate the effect of CSP and FP.

The framework for tracking and reporting on corporate social and environmental performance includes a set of social and environmental indicators carefully developed by MJRA. This framework is based largely on a stake- holder model and is similar in many ways to the framework used by the SiRi2 Network, of which MJRA is a founding member. To further establish the credibility of MJRA, it is worth noting that it has a longstanding research partnership with KLD Research & Analytics, Inc., a worldwide renowned ﬁrm providing environmental, social and gover- nance data to researchers outside of Canada. There were 222 companies listed for the year 2004 and 276 companies for the year 2005. CSP ratings were available for 179 companies for both 2004 and 2005. Missing values are attributed mostly to income funds and trusts. Variables Corporate social performance For the years 2004 and 2005 we use two measures of CSP developed by MJRA. First, we use the aggre- gate score of CSP. As researchers are now investi- gating the effects of individual dimension variables within the KLD and the CSID databases, we per- form our empirical tests using ratings for each of the dimensions (community and society, corporate governance, employees, environment, customers and human rights) as separate variables. Financial performance Following Mahoney and Roberts (2007), return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) were used separately to measure a ﬁrm’s FP. For robustness, we used stock market returns as an additional criterion. Data on ROA and ROE were derived from the Stock Guide database. Market returns were obtained from the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) through the Canadian Financial Market Research Center (CFMRC) database. In fact, Control variables Some difference in CSP and FP may result from ﬁrm size, ﬁrm risk and industry and need to be operationalized as control variables (Mahoney and Roberts, 2007; Ullman, 1985; Waddock and Graves, 1997). smaller ﬁrms may not exhibit as much overt socially responsible behav- iour as do larger ﬁrms (Waddock and Graves, 1997). Furthermore, less risky ﬁrms have a stable return model and invest, consequently, in socially responsible activities (Roberts, 1992). In addition, earlier research has shown that clear differences in performance and R&D investment exist among different industries (Graves and Waddock, 1994; Waddock and Graves, 1997). Size and systematic risk are also well-known determinants of FP (Fama and French, 1992, 1993). Firm size was measured using the natural loga- rithm of total assets. As a proxy for the riskiness of a ﬁrm, we used the long-term debt to total assets ratio and the beta factor. TSX industries are accounted for in our models by dummy variables. All control variables were obtained for the year 2004. Firm size and debt level were derived from the Stock Guide database. Beta factors, calculated on a ﬁve-year basis, were obtained from the TSX - CFMRC. Statistical analyses We address the link between FP and CSP in the context of Granger causality (Granger, 1969). This approach, applied to our context with two years of data, involves the following two-variable regression models (Gujarati, 1995): CSPi;2005 ¼ a0 þ a1CSPi;2004 þ a2FPi;2004 cjCij þ e1i; i ¼ 1; . . . ; N ð1Þ X J j¼1 þ FPi;2005 ¼ b0 þ b1FPi;2004 þ b2CSPi;2004 X J j¼1 þ djCij þ e2i; i ¼ 1; . . . ; N ð2Þ where CSPi,2005 and CSPi,2004 represent the CSP score in year 2005 and 2004 for ﬁrm i, FPi,2005 and FPi,2004 represent the FP in year 2005 and 2004 for ﬁrm i, Cij is the jth control variable for ﬁrm i, j = 1,…, J and e1i and e2i are uncorrelated Causality Between Corporate Social Performance and Financial Performance 413 TABLE I Descriptive statistics of the sample N Mean Median Standard deviation Minimum Maximum Corporate social performance (CSP) Aggregate CSP in 2005 Aggregate CSP in 2004 Community & society in 2005 Community & society in 2004 Corporate governance in 2005 Corporate governance in 2004 Employees in 2005 Employees in 2004 Environment in 2005 Environment in 2004 Customers in 2005 Customers in 2004 Human rights in 2005 Human rights in 2004 Corporate ﬁnancial performance Market returns in 2005 Market returns in 2004 ROA in 2005 ROA in 2004 ROE in 2005 ROE in 2004 Control variables Natural log. of assets in 2004 Debt level in 2004 Beta factor in 2004 179 179 179 179 179 179 179 179 179 179 159 159 120 115 168 168 179 179 179 179 179 179 179 4.72 4.77 4.15 4.05 6.67 6.56 4.24 4.15 5.15 5.12 4.79 5.04 2.75 3.80 0.14 0.40 0.03 0.03 0.09 0.07 14.80 0.17 0.71 4.6 4.7 3.8 3.7 6.6 6.6 4.1 4.0 5.1 5.0 5.0 5.0 2.3 4.0 0.15 0.29 0.04 0.03 0.11 0.09 14.61 0.15 0.50 Industries Communications & media Consumer products Financial services Gold & precious metals Industrial products Merchandizing Utilities Oil & gas Metals & minerals Paper 0.81 0.81 1.71 1.60 1.14 1.15 1.08 1.10 0.86 0.86 0.73 0.67 1.54 1.44 0.38 0.45 0.09 0.08 0.18 0.17 1.76 0.15 0.71 n 10 11 28 19 35 17 13 26 17 3 3.0 3.1 0.7 0.7 3.3 4.1 2.0 2.1 2.4 3.1 1.7 2.8 0.0 0.8 -1.00 -0.75 -0.69 -0.46 -1.29 -1.15 11.24 0.00 -0.41 7.1 7.1 8.8 8.7 9.3 8.9 7.1 7.3 7.1 7.4 6.3 6.6 5.8 7.9 1.91 1.94 0.23 0.28 0.59 0.62 19.87 0.70 3.92 % 5.6 6.2 15.6 10.6 19.6 9.5 7.3 14.5 9.5 1.7 i = 1,…, N.

The two- variable regression equations (1) and (2) are ﬁt sep- arately for all combinations of the CSP dimensions (aggregate CSP score, community and society, corporate governance, employees, environment, customers and human rights) with each one of the three FP measures (ROA, ROE, and stock market returns).

Results Descriptive statistics of the sample and simple correlation analysis Table I presents the descriptive statistics of CSP and FP measures and of the control variables. The means of the aggregate CSP score are 4.72 and 4.77 for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The means for the different CSP dimensions vary between 2.75 and 6.67 and, as for the aggregate CSP, they do not differ much between 2004 and 2005. Stock market returns were not available for 11 ﬁrms in our sample, so the analyses for that particular FP measures are based on a sample size of 168 observations. The average compounded stock market returns for 2005 and 2004 are 0.14 and 0.40, respectively. The mean ROA is 0.03 for both years and the mean ROE is 0.09 in 2005 and 0.07 in 2004. 416 Rim Makni et al.

Because there were only 3 paper-sector ﬁrms (Table I) whose averages for the CSP and FP measures were not statistically different from the average scores of the ﬁrms in the metals and minerals sector, ﬁrms in all these industries were pooled and were arbitrarily used as the reference category in the regression models. We ﬁnd for Model (1) in Tables III, IV and V that the relationship between the aggregate CSP score in 2005 and the three FP measures in 2004 are not sta- tistically signiﬁcant. Therefore, FP does not ‘‘Granger cause’’ CSP. As for the second model, we have a statistically signiﬁcant negative relationship between the aggregate CSP score in 2004 and stock market returns in 2005 (p = 0.024, Table III). This suggests a Causality Between Corporate Social Performance and Financial Performance 417 Results of the OLS regression models testing Granger causality between the aggregate CSP score and ROE (results of the Granger causality test are italicized) TABLE V Independent variable Dependent variable Aggregate CSP in 2005 (N = 179) ROE in 2005 (N = 179) Estimated coefﬁcient Standard error Intercept Aggregate CSP in 2004 ROE in 2004 Natural log. of assets Debt level Beta factor Industry Communications & media Consumer products Financial services Gold & precious metals Industrial products Merchandizing Utilities Oil & gas Metals, minerals & paper R2 0.284 0.932 0.116 0.009 0.084 -0.022 -0.154 -0.362 -0.034 -0.023 -0.109 -0.286 -0.419 -0.170 Reference 0.905 0.216 0.030 0.126 0.015 0.159 0.032 0.101 0.100 0.083 0.089 0.074 0.086 0.098 0.079 p-value 0.190 <0.001 0.359 0.573 0.597 0.498 0.129 <0.001 0.687 0.797 0.141 0.001 <0.001 0.033 Estimated coefﬁcient Standard error -0.017 -0.022 0.440 0.025 -0.179 -0.055 -0.113 -0.091 -0.196 -0.205 -0.080 -0.135 -0.090 -0.129 Reference 0.420 0.116 0.016 0.068 0.008 0.085 0.017 0.054 0.053 0.045 0.048 0.039 0.046 0.053 0.042 p-value 0.884 0.162 <0.001 0.003 0.038 0.002 0.038 0.089 <0.001 <0.001 0.044 0.004 0.088 0.003 *Granger causality test is statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level or lower. unidirectional ‘‘Granger causal’’ relationship between the aggregate CSP score and stock market returns: a higher overall corporate social performance ‘‘Granger causes’’ a lower market return on average. The rela- tionships between the aggregate CSP score in 2004 with ROA and ROE in 2005 are however not sta- tistically signiﬁcant (see Tables IV and V). It is also worth noting that the results from the causality speciﬁcations using the aggregate CSP as the dependent variable show very high R2 (91%). This is mainly due to the very strong association between 2005 and 2004 CSP scores (Table II), suggesting little variation in these scores over that two-year period. Results of the different CSP dimensions Rather than focusing on the composite measure of CSP, some authors examined the individual dimensions of CSP (e.g. Fisman et al., 2005; Hillman (e.g. and Keim, 2001; Nelling and Webb, 2006). The ﬁndings of Hillman and Keim (2001) indicate that the restricted CSP measure linked to stakeholder management shareholders, employees, cus- tomers) is associated with FP. In addition, Fisman et al. (2005) ﬁnd that the individual measure of CSP regarding community positively affects FP in advertising-intensive industries. Furthermore, Nel- ling and Webb (2006) test the relationship between FP and individual measures of CSP and ﬁnd that the only aspect of CSP driven by ﬁnancial performance is ‘employee relations’. In the present study, we examine the relationship between FP and individual measures of CSP derived from the CSID (community and society, corporate gov- ernance, employees, customers, environment and human rights). Speciﬁcally, we ﬁt the regression Models (1) and (2) six different times by substituting the CSP score of community and society, corporate governance, employees, customers, environment and human rights for 418 Rim Makni et al.

We ﬁnd no statistically signiﬁcant relationship between the CSP individual measures and the FP measures except for environment and employee. Hence, only the regression results with these latter two dimensions are presented in more detail here.3 Results for the employee CSP score are similar to those of the aggregate CSP score, i.e. there is a statistically signiﬁcant negative association in Model (2) between the employee CSP score in 2004 and stock market returns in 2005 (p = 0.038), and this latter signiﬁcant association is not observed with ROA and ROE. testing ‘‘Granger Tables VI, VII and VIII present the results of the causality’’ regression models between the CSP environment score and market re- turns, ROA, and ROE, respectively. There is no statistically signiﬁcant relationship between the three FP measures in 2004 and the CSP environment score in 2005; the p-values are 0.489, 0.162 and 0.319 for market returns, ROA, and ROE, respectively. On the other hand, there is a statistically signiﬁcant and negative relationship of the 2004 CSP environment score with the 2005 stock market returns (p = 0.002, Table VI) and also with the 2005 ROA (p = 0.028, Table VII). The negative relationship with ROE in 2005 is close to being statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level (p = 0.059, Table VIII), which gives robustness to our results. Hence, the ﬁnding of an unidirectional and negative ‘‘Granger causal’’ rela- tionship between the CSP environment score and the FP measures supports the trade-off hypothesis and, in part, the negative synergy hypothesis.4 Indeed, our ﬁndings suggest a negative impact of CSP envi- ronment score on FP measures but the latter does not affect CSP. Conclusions This study was undertaken to investigate the causal relationship between CSP and FP in Canadian ﬁrms. Causality Between Corporate Social Performance and Financial Performance 419 Results of the OLS regression models testing Granger causality between the environment score and ROA (results of the Granger causality test are italicized) TABLE VII Independent variable Dependent variable Environment in 2005 (N = 179) ROA in 2005 (N = 179) Estimated coefﬁcient Standard error Intercept Environment in 2004 ROA in 2004 Natural log. of assets Debt level Beta factor Industry Communications & media Consumer products Financial services Gold & precious metals Industrial products Merchandizing Utilities Oil & gas Metals, minerals & paper R2 1.502 0.927 0.487 -0.053 0.331 0.005 -0.394 -0.560 -0.468 -0.188 -0.342 -0.402 -0.608 -0.562 Reference 0.862 0.285 0.032 0.347 0.018 0.206 0.041 0.129 0.127 0.107 0.117 0.094 0.111 0.126 0.101 p-value <0.001 <0.001 0.162 0.004 0.110 0.902 0.003 <0.001 <0.001 0.111 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 *Granger causality test is statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level or lower.

According to Mahoney and Roberts (2007) but contrary to Waddock and Graves (1997) our results suggest no signiﬁcant relationship between the aggregated CSP score and FP, except for market returns. This latter ﬁnding is mainly driven by the statistically signiﬁcant results of the environment and employee dimensions of CSP. However, we ﬁnd a robust unidirectional and negative ‘‘Granger causal’’ relationship between the environmental dimension of CSP and all three FP measures, which is consis- tent with the trade-off hypothesis and, in part, with the negative synergy hypothesis which states that socially responsible ﬁrms experience lower proﬁts and reduced shareholder wealth, which in turn limits the socially responsible investments. Regulatory compliance, management systems and good control of resources and pollution should, theoretically, create a social reputation amongst stakeholders that will eventually enhance ﬁnancial performance. However, our results show that cor- porate social initiatives in Canada, especially envi- ronmental programmes, lead to poor performance in the short term. Compared to large US corporations, Canadian ﬁrms are relatively small in size. Envi- ronmental initiatives appear too costly and do not seem to be considered as sound investments by the Canadian market. Government subsidies may be necessary to compensate for the short-term negative impact on ﬁnancial performance that these ﬁrms suffer. Firms and policy makers can use the results of this study to understand the short run ﬁnancial implications of making environmental spending decisions and improve corporate environmental disclosure in Canada. Although our results show that a better environmental performance is associated with poor short run FP, as Ambec and Lanoie (2007) argue, augmented environmental expenses could be compensated in the long run by increases in 420 Rim Makni et al.

These results must be interpreted with some limitations in mind. First, the CSP measures used in the analyses are subject to the limitations inherent in the measurement of CSP activities. Indeed, although an independent ﬁrm performs the CSID ratings, they are based on this ﬁrm’s deﬁnition and evalua- tion of CSP. Second, our analysis takes into account only the years 2004 and 2005. Further studies should aim at evaluating the long-term relation existing between CSP and FP. Notes 1 MJRA started publishing CSP scores in 2004. Prior to 2004, CSP was evaluated solely by using strengths calculated composite and concerns (or weaknesses). Mahoney and Roberts (2007) scores by subtracting ‘‘weaknesses’’ ratings from ‘‘strengths’’ ratings. These authors acknowledged the limitations of their approach and stated in their conclusion that ‘‘… future research using different weights for each of the CSP dimensions may prove to be beneﬁcial’’. In the present study, we use the weighted scores calculated by MJRA. 2 for ‘‘Sustainable Investment Research International Ltd’’.

How- ever, we found only a few outlying observations for the FP measures. We did the ‘‘Granger causality’’ analyses without these few outlying observations, and we ob- tained similar results that do not change the conclu- sions. For example, the p-value associated with the negative regression coefﬁcient of the CSP environment score in 2004 with each one of the three dependent FP measures in 2005 was even lower and reaches statistical signiﬁcance for ROE (p = 0.001 for market returns in 2005, p = 0.004 for ROA in 2005 and p = 0.010 for ROE in 2005).
