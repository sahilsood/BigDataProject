Journal of Management Studies 42:2 March 2005 0022-2380 An Examination of Differences Between Organizational Legitimacy and Organizational Reputation* David L. Deephouse and Suzanne M. Carter University of Alberta; University of Notre Dame, Indiana  Organizational legitimacy and organizational reputation have similar antecedents, social construction processes and consequences. Nonetheless, an improved understanding of relationships between legitimacy and reputation requires that differences between the two be speciﬁed and clariﬁed. Our examination of past research indicates that legitimacy emphasizes the social acceptance resulting from adherence to social norms and expectations whereas reputation emphasizes comparisons among organizations. We empirically examine two antecedents of the ﬁnancial, regulatory, and public dimensions of legitimacy and reputation in a population of US commercial banks. We ﬁnd that isomorphism improves legitimacy, but its effects on reputation depend on the bank’s reputation. Moreover, higher ﬁnancial performance increases reputation, but does not increase the legitimacy of high performing banks. INTRODUCTION Organizational legitimacy and organizational reputation are two concepts repre- senting assessments of an organization by a social system. Legitimacy has had a major impact on many organization theories, including institutional theory (Meyer and Rowan, 1977), resource dependence theory (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978), and organizational  ecology  (Carroll  and  Hannan, 1989). The  concept’s  frequent appearances prompted Suchman (1995, p. 571) to observe that legitimacy is ‘an anchor-point of a vastly expanded theoretical apparatus addressing the normative and cognitive forces that constrain, construct, and empower organizational actors.’ Interest in organizational reputation ignited in the last two decades. The busi- ness and popular press, such as Fortune, The Financial Times, and US News & World Report fuelled this ﬁre by publishing reputational rankings of businesses and uni- Address for reprints: David L.

Reputation has played a role in status theory in sociology (Shrum and Wuthnow, 1988), the resource-based view of the ﬁrm in strategy (Hall, 1992) and game theory in economics (Weigelt and Camerer, 1988). As currently understood, there are many similarities between the two concepts. Firstly, they result from similar social construction processes as stakeholders eval- uate  an  organization  (Ashforth  and  Gibbs, 1990; Fombrun  and  Shanley, 1990). Secondly, the concepts have been linked to similar antecedents, such as organiza- tional  size, charitable  giving, strategic  alliances, and  regulatory  compliance (Fombrun  and  Shanley, 1990; Galaskiewicz, 1985; Oliver, 1990; Stuart, 2000). Thirdly, an  important  consequence  of both  is  the  improved  ability  to  acquire resources (Hall, 1992; Suchman, 1995). Reviews for each concept can be found in Suchman (1995) and Ruef and Scott (1998) for legitimacy, and in Fombrun and van Riel (1997) and Fombrun (1996) for reputation. These  similarities  indicate  substantial  conceptual  overlap  between  legitimacy and reputation. Such overlap often occurs in theory building because concepts are in ﬂux as the theories incorporating them develop (Kaplan, 1964; Stinchcombe, 1968, p. 40). As Wright (1985, p. 292) observed: ‘The process of concept forma- tion is always simultaneously the process of concept transformation’. Although efforts to develop and test theories of legitimacy and reputation are laudatory, there has been limited research distinguishing the two concepts. We help to ﬁll this gap so that future research can develop a better understanding of the relationships between legitimacy and reputation (Kaplan, 1964). Thus, the main purpose of this paper is to examine the distinctive properties of legitimacy and reputation and the degree to which similar antecedents produce different outcomes in the same empirical context. We proceed as follows. Firstly, we highlight key differences in the deﬁnitions of legitimacy and reputation. Secondly, we examine two antecedents, isomorphism and ﬁnancial performance, that may affect the legitimacy and reputation differ- ently. We focus primarily on legitimacy and reputation at the organizational level of analysis, but our analysis could be extended to other levels. Our empirical analy- sis  in  a  sample  of commercial  banks  supports  our  conjectures. A  discussion  of implications and limitations concludes the paper. THEORY DEVELOPMENT Comparing Deﬁnitions of Legitimacy and Reputation Although legitimacy and reputation have many similarities and have been men- tioned in the same papers (e.g. Brown, 1997, p. 668; Elsbach, 1994, pp. 66, 69; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990, p. 233; Stuart, 1998, p. 674), efforts to distinguish the two concepts have been rare and empirical assessments of any differences non- existent. Of the rare theoretical exceptions, two useful papers that distinguished © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 Organizational Legitimacy 331 legitimacy and reputation are Lawrence (1998), a theory-building case study that examined  the  emergence  of the  forensic  accounting  profession, and  Ruef and Scott (1998), which outlined a general model of legitimacy and statistically tested part of it using professional evaluations of hospitals as measures of normative legit- imacy. These papers suggest two important criteria for distinguishing legitimacy and reputation: the nature of the assessment stated in the deﬁnition and the dimen- sions on which legitimacy and reputation can be assessed. Legitimacy  has  been  assessed  in  past  deﬁnitions  in  terms  of acceptability  or acceptance (Brown, 1997, p. 664; Knoke, 1985, p. 222; Meyer and Rowan, 1977, p. 351), taken-for-grantedness  (Carroll  and  Hannan, 1989; Meyer  and  Rowan, 1977), reasonableness, appropriateness, and congruence (Brown, 1998; Dowling and Pfeffer, 1975; Meyer and Rowan, 1977). Suchman (1995, pp. 573–4) presented an  encompassing  deﬁnition  of legitimacy  as  ‘the  generalized  perception  or assumption  that  the  actions  of an  entity  are  desirable, proper, or  appropriate’ within a social system. Thus, it appears that a central element of legitimacy, as currently  understood, is  meeting  and  adhering  to  the  expectations  of a  social system’s norms, values, rules, and meanings (Hirsch and Andrews, 1984; Parsons, 1960). For example, Lawrence (1998) suggested that legitimacy indicates that one is qualiﬁed for a particular profession. That is, the person has the knowledge, skills, or competence to be a member of that profession. Ruef and Scott (1998) followed Scott (1995) and wrote that organizations must conform to normative rules, regu- lative processes, and cognitive meanings. Some expectations can be explicit and set by professional associations, governments, etc. (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983); others can be implicit and emerge over time from interactions among participants in a social system (Edelman, 1992). Regardless of the source of these expectations (Ruef and Scott, 1998), social actors generally accept and take for granted legiti- mate organizations (Suchman, 1995). In  contrast  to  legitimacy, reputation  has  been  assessed  in  past  deﬁnitions  in terms  of relative  standing  or  desirability  (Shrum  and  Wuthnow, 1988), quality (Podolny, 1993), esteem (Dollinger et al., 1997; Fombrun, 1996, p. 37; Hall, 1992, p. 138; Heugens, 2004), and  favourableness  (Deephouse, 2000). Shenkar  and Yuchtman-Yaar (1997) equated reputation with image, esteem, prestige, and good- will in developing the encompassing concept of organizational standing, because all terms indicate the relative position of an organization amongst its counterparts. Ruef and Scott (1998) similarly highlighted status comparisons as central in rep- utation. At the individual level, Lawrence (1998) proposed that the reputation of a forensic accountant indicates expertise vis-à-vis other accountants. Thus, central to a reputation is a comparison of organizations to determine their relative stand- ing. For any two organizations, they will either have the same reputation or, more likely, one will have a better reputation than the other. A  second  way  to  distinguish  legitimacy  and  reputation  is  by  comparing  the dimensions on which they can be assessed. We follow Ruef and Scott’s (1998, p. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 332 D. L. Deephouse and S. M. Carter 879) recommendation that legitimacy assessments be restricted to those involving regulative, normative  or  cognitive  dimensions. In  contrast, reputation  may  be assessed on these dimensions but can also be assessed on ‘virtually any attribute along which organizations may vary that can serve as a source of status compar- isons’. Thus, in this framework there are some attributes for which reputation can be evaluated but for which legitimacy cannot. For instance, one attribute could be the architectural merit of corporate headquarters’ buildings. What is critical, then, is comparing the nature of legitimacy and reputation assessments when using the same dimension. Thus, we view legitimacy as the social acceptance resulting from adherence to regulative, normative or cognitive norms and expectations. In contrast, we view reputation as a social comparison among organizations on a variety of attributes, which could include these same regulative, normative or cognitive dimensions. In Lawrence’s terms (1998, p. 1122), reputation ‘differentiate(s) between the qualiﬁed [i.e., legitimate] and the “outstanding” forensic accountants’. We next develop a set of propositions that further distinguish legitimacy and reputation based on their antecedents. Differences in Antecedents: Isomorphism for  reputation), charitable  donations  (Fombrun, 1996, Antecedents of both legitimacy and reputation identiﬁed in past research include diversiﬁcation  strategies  (Fligstein, 1991, for  legitimacy; Fombrun  and  Shanley, 1990, for  reputation; Galaskiewicz, 1985, for legitimacy), and size (Baum and Oliver, 1991, for legiti- macy; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990, for reputation). Symbolic action and impres- sion management may also affect legitimacy and reputation (Ashforth and Gibbs, 1990; Bromley, 1993; Brown, 1994; Dutton and Dukerich, 1991). Our review of research, however, suggests two critical antecedents that may distinguish legitimacy and reputation – isomorphism and ﬁnancial performance. In developing proposi- tions about individual organizations within an industry and organizational ﬁeld, we assume the industry itself (e.g. tobacco, Ashforth and Gibbs, 1990) or the orga- nizational form (e.g. conglomerate form, Davis et al., 1994) is not subject to legiti- macy challenges. Isomorphism  is  a  central  and  multifaceted  concept  of institutional  theory (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Meyer and Rowan, 1977). The facet we use is as a state concept at the organizational level, indicating the extent to which an orga- nization  is  mimetic  (i.e. similar)  on  certain  attribute(s)  to  other  organizations  in  an  organizational  ﬁeld. ‘Institutional  isomorphism  is  manifested  empirically  as increased conformity’, according to Westphal et al. (1997, p. 371). Isomorphism is  binary  for  some  attributes, such  as  whether  a  municipality  has  adopted  civil service reform (Tolbert and Zucker, 1983). Isomorphism can become more ﬁne- grained for other attributes, such as scholarly content (Kraatz and Zajac, 1996; © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 Organizational Legitimacy 333 Levitt  and  Nass, 1989), legal  contracts  (Suchman, 1994), strategies  (Deephouse, 1996; Haveman, 1993), or a set of discrete choices like hospital quality practices (Westphal et al., 1997). A fundamental proposition of institutional theory is that isomorphism leads to legitimacy (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Meyer and Rowan, 1977). Organizations conforming to commonly used strategies, structures, and practices appear rational and prudent to the social system and, therefore, are generally considered accept- able (Fligstein, 1991; Tolbert and Zucker, 1983). These commonly used strategies, structures, and  practices  often  emerge  from  the  interactions  of organizations within an industry or ﬁeld and other stakeholders (Edelman, 1992). They may also be  imposed  by  powerful  entities  like  the  state, implying  strong  incentives  to conform (Scott, 1995). Conversely, organizations that deviate from normal behav- iour  violate  cultural  or  legal  expectations  and  theories  of organizing. They  are subject to legitimacy challenges and may be deemed unacceptable by stakehold- ers (Hirsch and Andrews, 1984; Meyer and Rowan, 1977; Meyer and Scott, 1983; Stjernberg  and  Philips, 1993). Organizational  level  research  found  that  isomor- phism on different attributes (e.g. strategies, missions, TQM practices) has a posi- tive effect on different types of legitimacy (e.g. regulative, normative) (Deephouse, 1996; Ruef and Scott, 1998; Westphal et al., 1997). Thus: Proposition 1: Isomorphism is positively related to legitimacy. The literature has been quite quiet about the effect of isomorphism on reputation at  the  organizational  level. One  might  expect  that  some  level  of conformity  to social norms would be necessary in order to develop a favourable reputation, yet gaining  a  favourable  reputation  implies  that  differentiation  is  also  necessary. According to Fombrun (1996, p. 393), ‘The more a company pursues a strategy that differentiates it from rivals with each of its major constituent groups, the more likely  are  constituents  to  ascribe  a  strong  reputation  to  the  company . . .’ So  it appears that while conformity through isomorphism will likely lead to legitimacy, further efforts at differentiation may be necessary to achieve higher levels of repu- tation. Thus, isomorphic behaviour may have a different outcome on reputation than it has on legitimacy. While scholars have been quiet on the relationship between isomorphism and reputation, over the last ﬁfty years there were spates of research by sociologists and social psychologists studying the similar concepts of conformity and status (for a review, see Phillips and Zuckerman, 2001). A relevant ﬁnding from this research is  that  conformity  is  differentially  related  to  status  based  on  where  the  actor  is located within the status hierarchy. In particular, an enduring legacy is the concept of ‘idiosyncrasy credits’, coined by Hollander (1958), which refers to the ability of high status actors to deviate from group norms without penalty. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 334 D. L. Deephouse and S. M. Carter In a study of law and investment ﬁrms, Phillips and Zuckerman (2001) found that low and high status actors were more likely to adopt non-conforming prac- tices, but for different reasons; middle-status actors were most likely to conform. While Phillips and Zuckerman (2001, p. 383) focused on the effect of status on conformity, they acknowledged that their ‘two ideal-typical phases’ of conformity and evaluation ‘are temporally intertwined’. Indeed, past research also examined how conformity affects status (e.g. Ridgeway, 1981). Consistent with our goal of highlighting differences between legitimacy and reputation, we found it useful to specify isomorphism as an antecedent of reputation to parallel its relationship to legitimacy. We follow the reasoning of Phillips and Zuckerman (2001) and con- sider different relations for middle, high and low status actors. Middle status actors conform because they seek to maintain their status. Devia- tion is viewed by constituents as questionable and unusual and therefore is more likely to lower the actor’s status than to raise it (Phillips and Zuckerman, 2001). Thus, we expect a positive relationship between isomorphism and reputation for middle status actors. Higher status organizations are more secure in their roles than are middle or lower status  organizations. This  gives  idiosyncrasy  credits  that  allow  them  to  exhibit  non-conforming behaviour (Ashforth and Gibbs, 1990; Hollander, 1958; Phillips and Zuckerman, 2001). Constituents may even judge such non-isomorphic actions positively. Indeed, social  psychology  research  indicates  that  non-conformity  by high status actors may in fact enhance their status (Berkowitz and Macaulay, 1961). Thus, there  may  be  a  negative  relationship  between  isomorphic  behaviour  and reputation among higher status ﬁrms. Our expectation for low status organizations differs from that of Phillips and Zuckerman  (2001)  because  our  boundary  conditions  differ. They  assumed  that  low  status  actors  resign  themselves  to  their  low  status  and  thus  do  not  concern  themselves with the implications of deviation. Phillips and Zuckerman (2001) also assumed actors have the option to move to alternative contexts (interfaces, in their paper). We propose these may not hold in some settings. For instance, regulatory rules in our empirical context, the commercial banking industry, limited alterna- tives, and deviation could result in closure by regulators (Spong, 1990). In this case, lower  status  organizations  have  ‘little  choice  but  to  redouble  their  efforts  to  signal membership through greater conformity’ (Phillips and Zuckerman, 2001, p. 389), with the intention of moving into the middle or high status. Some low status organizations may raise their status by conforming to industry practices, con- sistent  with  mimetic  behaviour  resulting  from  problemistic  search  (Cyert  and March, 1963; Haveman, 1993). Moreover, we expect this isomorphic behaviour to  be  viewed  positively  by  constituents. Thus, we  expect  a  positive  relationship between  isomorphism  and  reputation  for  lower  status  organizations  within  our context. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 Organizational Legitimacy 335 Taken  together, these  arguments  suggest  that  an  organization’s  isomorphic actions will be interpreted differently by constituents depending on the organiza- tion’s reputation. Thus: Proposition 2: For organizations with lower reputations, isomorphism is positively related to reputation. For organizations with better reputations, isomorphism is negatively related to reputation. Differences in Antecedents: Financial Performance Financial performance has been linked to legitimacy and reputation as both an antecedent and an outcome. We focus on ﬁnancial performance as an antecedent. Society expects for-proﬁt business organizations to convert inputs efﬁciently into goods and services and to have concomitant ﬁnancial outcomes; legitimacy accrues to those organizations that do (Czarniawska-Joerges, 1989; Dowling and Pfeffer, 1975). Because ﬁnancial performance is an indicator of efﬁciency and success, it should  be  related  in  some  way  to  legitimacy. The  issue  for  assessing  its  relative impact on legitimacy is whether ﬁnancial performance is sufﬁciently low that ques- tions are asked about the company’s existence (Meyer and Scott, 1983). Accord- ing to Hirsch and Andrews (1984, pp. 173–4): Performance challenges [to legitimacy] occur when organizations are perceived by relevant actors as having failed to execute the purpose for which they are chartered and claim support. The values they serve are not at issue, but rather their  performance  in  ‘delivering  the  goods’ and  meeting  the  goals  of their mission are called into question. [A performance challenge] places the target in an  inherently  more  unstable  situation  than  is  addressed  in  a  comparative  or  longitudinal examination of administrative efﬁciency. Such challenges may restrict market access (Brown, 1994, 1998; Phillips and Zuck- erman, 2001), especially when originating from organizations with coercive power (Stinchcombe, 1968; Weber, 1968). For instance, a company approaching bank- ruptcy becomes increasingly controlled by governmental regulations designed to stabilize the business. This observation suggests that normal ﬂuctuations in performance are likely not the  basis  of changes  in  legitimacy  for  ﬁrms  meeting  ﬁnancial  expectations. For example, a for-proﬁt business that reports a lower quarterly proﬁt is not necessar- ily viewed as less legitimate. Although the ﬁrm may not have met the expectations of certain stakeholders who beneﬁt, such as investors, it will not be perceived as any less qualiﬁed to remain in business. Also, two ﬁrms that are identical, except that  one’s  ﬁnancial  performance  is  5.1  per  cent  and  the  other’s  is  5.0  per  cent, © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 336 D. L. Deephouse and S. M. Carter would likely have no difference in legitimacy. Consideration of the organizational life cycle is also needed; start-up ﬁrms typically lose money but are not concomi- tantly considered illegitimate. Taken together, these arguments suggest that ﬁnancial performance has differ- ent effects on legitimacy: Proposition 3: For organizations with lower levels of ﬁnancial performance, ﬁnan- cial performance is positively related to legitimacy. For organizations with higher levels of ﬁnancial performance, there is no relationship between ﬁnancial per- formance and legitimacy. In  contrast  to  our  proposition  for  legitimacy, we  expect  a  positive  relationship between ﬁnancial performance and reputation at all performance levels based on past  research. Superior  ﬁnancial  performance  predisposes  stakeholders  to  assess an  organization  more  favourably  (Fombrun  and  Shanley, 1990). It  indicates  the organization’s ability to satisfy the self-interests of its exchange partners, such as investors, employees, and customers, and enhances expectations that the ﬁrm will continue to do so (Fombrun, 1996). Indeed, researchers found that ﬁnancial per- formance is a crucial, even overwhelming, determinant of corporate reputation (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Sobol and Farrelly, 1988). The effect of performance on reputation has been found not just for ﬁnancial performance but also for other aspects of performance. The philanthropic elite of Minneapolis-Saint Paul viewed companies as more generous donors and as successful businesses if they donated more to charity and were more proﬁtable, respectively (Galaskiewicz, 1995). Sci- entiﬁc accomplishment was positively related to status in the nuclear waste and photovoltaic research communities (Shrum and Wuthnow, 1988). Thus: Proposition 4: Higher ﬁnancial performance is positively related to reputation. METHODS We test these propositions using data from the population of commercial banks  in  the  Minneapolis-Saint  Paul  Metropolitan  Area, USA  (Twin  Cities, hereafter) during  1985  to  1992. Commercial  banking  is  an  appropriate  setting  to  test  our propositions because the industry faces strong institutional and competitive pres- sures, which means that legitimacy and reputation are important (Scott and Meyer, 1991; Weigelt and Camerer, 1988). Studying a single population in a single met- ropolitan area controls for differences in industries and community norms. Twin Cities  commercial  banks  are  in  an  organizational  ﬁeld  with  common  suppliers, consumers, and regulators (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983, p. 148). The sample of banks and relevant ﬁnancial data were collected from the Call Reports database of bank regulators. The unit of analysis is the bank-year. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 Organizational Legitimacy 337 There  were  several  notable  competitive  and  institutional  issues  in  the  Twin Cities commercial banking market. One competitive issue was consolidation within the metropolitan area subsequent to changes in state banking law. A second was that the Twin Cities economy did not have as severe a recession as other parts of the country and was thus spared a large number of bank closures. An important institutional  issue  was  banking  for  underserved  neighbourhoods. Late  in  the sample  period, regulators  were  mandated  by  Congress  to  make  public  their  evaluations  of how  each  bank  was  responding  to  this  issue  (i.e. CRA  ratings). These issues are reﬂected in our study’s measures. Dependent Variables Legitimacy  and  reputation  are  complex, multidimensional  concepts  linked  to  a variety of stakeholders. An ideal study would have sufﬁcient resources to measure all dimensions. From a pragmatic perspective, we followed Fombrun (1996) and Ruef and  Scott  (1998)  and  limit  our  research  design  to  certain  dimensions  (cf. Sudman, 1976). We created measures of regulative legitimacy from the perspec- tive of bank regulators, normative legitimacy from the perspective of the general public, ﬁnancial  reputation  from  the  perspective  of bank  customers  and  rating agencies, and  normative  reputation  from  the  perspective  of the  general  public (Fombrun, 1996; Scott, 1995). Our use of ﬁnancial information to create legiti- macy  and  reputation  measures  is  consistent  with  research  indicating  that  stake- holders  use  ﬁnancial  information  in  making  these  assessments  about  for-proﬁt organizations  (Fombrun, 1996; Hirsch  and  Andrews, 1984). And  as  described below, it is consistent with the practices used by regulators, rating agencies, and customers themselves. It is also analogous to how health care stakeholders use mor- tality  rates  and  other  health  care  performance  indicators  to  evaluate  hospitals (Health Grades Inc., 2002). The community is an important stakeholder, and its norms and values are important criteria for evaluating legitimacy and reputation (Fombrun, 1996; Suchman, 1995). We used media data to capture the perspective of the general public. As elaborated below, the sample used for the community stakeholder  differs  from  the  sample  used  for  the  regulatory  and  ﬁnancial  stake- holders because of data availability and resource constraints (Sudman, 1976). Financial regulatory legitimacy. Regulative legitimacy reﬂects the conformity of orga- nizational  action  to  regulatory  standards  and  has  been  measured  using  govern- ment reports (e.g. Baum and Oliver, 1991; Deephouse, 1996; Singh et al., 1986). In banking, the safety and soundness of the ﬁnancial system and the protection of consumers’ deposits  are  central  concerns  of US  regulators  (Spong, 1985). An important  tool  used  by  regulators  is  the  evaluation  of a  bank’s  capital  position, which reﬂects the bank’s ability to protect depositor savings. We used the federal government’s regulatory ratings to measure regulative legitimacy. During 1985–88, © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 338 D. L. Deephouse and S. M. Carter regulators  classiﬁed  banks  into  three  discrete  ordered  categories, based  on  their total capital ratio and their size, as presented in Appendix A (Spong, 1985). Regu- lators labelled banks in the highest category ‘adequately capitalized’; banks in the intermediate category were considered ‘minimally capitalized’; and banks in the lowest category were considered ‘undercapitalized’. We created a variable called ﬁnancial regulatory legitimacy by numbering the categories 0, 1, and 2, with 2 repre- senting adequately capitalized. For 1989–92, US regulators changed their classiﬁ- cation scheme. Combined with an improvement in regional business conditions, no banks in the Twin Cities area had substandard capital levels during this later period  (although  other  banks  in  the  USA  did). We  could  not  statistically  test  regulative legitimacy during the second half of our sample period because there  was  no  variation  in  the  dependent  variable. Thus, our  sample  consisted  of 154 banks  over  four  years. After  accounting  for  entries  and  exits, there  were  553  observations. This regulatory classiﬁcation is consistent with the conceptual distinctions raised earlier. Regulators’ use of the term ‘adequately’ ﬁts with the view of legitimacy  as being acceptable or qualiﬁed (Brown, 1994; Lawrence, 1998). For banks in the two lower categories, regulators would increase their supervisory oversight. This included  restricting  banks’ fundamental  business  decisions, such  as  borrowing, lending, and acquisitions; it also included replacing bank employees, especially top managers (Spong, 1985). Thus, increased regulatory supervision is also consistent with theory. As a legitimacy challenge, it limits unfettered access to markets and could lead to closure of a business by powerful entities (Brown, 1994, 1998; Hirsch and Andrews, 1984; Stinchcombe, 1968). Financial  reputation. We  measured  ﬁnancial  reputation  for  the  same  sample  to  facilitate comparison between legitimacy and reputation. Regulators do not make reputational distinctions for bank safety and soundness. Nevertheless, many bank customers seek more detailed information about the relative safety of individual banks. Even ‘small businesses are worried about the stability of the banks they deal with’ because many have deposits in excess of that covered by government deposit insurance (Valvo, 1988, p. 1). The growing number of bank failures heightened customer  interest  in  monitoring  banks  (Maloney, 1990; Valvo, 1988). Although  regulators have complex on-site examinations of banks, the results are not released to the public, a policy that is sometimes challenged (e.g. Scott et al., 1991). In this context, an industry of bank rating agencies developed to evaluate banks’ ﬁnan- cial stability, consistent with the general development of specialized intermediaries that evaluate the reputation of complex organizations (Fombrun, 1996). More than a  dozen  agencies  existed  in  our  sample  period, including  Duff and  Phelps, Sheshunoff, and Veribanc. These agencies analysed banks’ Call Report data, inter- viewed bank management, and provided user-friendly analyses to paying clients. Their  evaluation  systems  are  trade  secrets  and  ratings  are  expensive  to  obtain, © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 Organizational Legitimacy 339 especially given the number of active rating agencies. Only the largest US banks are rated by agencies that interview management, given the costs, whereas agen- cies  that  use  only  quantitative  analysis  examine  all  banks  (Kraus, 1998). Our sample included mostly smaller banks. Given these factors, we sought a proxy for ﬁnancial reputation (Sudman, 1976). Maloney (1990) reviewed the industry and interviewed representatives of six rating agencies. The three that used quantitative models reported that asset quality was the most important factor in their models. Asset quality indicates the proportion of bank  loans  on  which  customers  are  paying  interest  (Maloney, 1990). One agency, Sheshunoff, selected asset quality because its surveys indicated that bankers themselves ranked asset quality as most important. Locher (1992) and Valvo (1988) recommended that small businesses use asset quality to reduce their search costs of ﬁnding a quality bank. In other words, asset quality functions as a reputational signal (Weigelt and Camerer, 1988). Higher levels indicate that a bank has a higher quality  loan  portfolio  and  is  therefore  more  ﬁnancially  stable  than  a  bank  with lower levels. In sum, we measured ﬁnancial reputation using the following asset quality ratio calculated from the Call Report data. Financial reputation = 1 - (Allowance for loan and lease losses + Loans 90 days overdue + Loans not accruing)/Total Equity We measured ﬁnancial reputation for the entire period 1985–92. Because of our interest in comparing this measure with ﬁnancial regulatory legitimacy, our results report only the analyses for the 553 observations during 1985–88. Results for the remaining period were similar. Public legitimacy. Normative (or moral) legitimacy reﬂects the consistency of orga- nizational action with social norms and values (Parsons, 1960; Suchman, 1995). Dowling and Pfeffer (1975, pp. 124–5) wrote that norms and values are reﬂected in  the  communications  and  writings  of a  society. Also, media  research  found  a close alignment between media content and public opinion as part of the agenda- setting and framing paradigms, with most research indicating the media are active participants in the social construction processes of the public (Ader, 1995; Gamson et  al., 1992; McCombs  and  Shaw, 1972). Thus, we  followed  past  research  and measured  normative  legitimacy  using  content  analysis  of media  data  (Barron, 1998; Brown and Deegan, 1998; Davis et al., 1994; Deephouse, 1996; Lamertz and Baum, 1998). We call our measure public legitimacy to distinguish it from mea- sures of normative legitimacy based on professional endorsements (e.g. Ruef and Scott, 1998). We limited our sample period for this measure to 1988–92 for two reasons. First, a  change  in  state  banking  regulations  allowed  the  area’s  bank holding  companies  to  consolidate  their  independent  branch  banking  units  as  of December 1987. Media coverage before 1988 was not speciﬁc enough to identify © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 340 D. L. Deephouse and S. M. Carter a particular bank. Second, we sought greater coding accuracy within resource con- straints by selecting more articles in fewer years and coding the full text of each article (Sudman, 1976; Weber, 1990). The local print media was selected because past research suggested it best covers local  businesses. Newspapers  had  a  stronger  effect  than  television  in  setting  the public’s agenda for local issues (Palmgreen and Clarke, 1977). A nationwide survey found that that 67.3 per cent of the respondents got their news about local busi- nesses from the local newspaper; every other source scored less than 27.1 per cent (Stempel, 1991). Recall is stronger from newspaper stories (DeFleur et al., 1992), which increases the likelihood that stakeholders will take action to support or chal- lenge a bank (Fiske and Taylor, 1984; Schramm, 1949). Thus, local newspapers should be the best media source of public knowledge, values, and opinions about local banks. The speciﬁc newspapers chosen were The Minneapolis Star Tribune and The Saint Paul Pioneer Press, the two metropolitan dailies having the largest circula- tions in the area. The  sample  of articles  consisted  of all  letters  to  the  editor, all  editorials, all columns, and a stratiﬁed sample of the remaining articles. All letters, editorials, and columns were included because they represent interpretations of ﬁrms that are  overt  attempts  to  inﬂuence  attitudes  (Fombrun  and  Shanley, 1990; Hynds, 1989, 1994). A two-step process was used to select the remaining articles. All arti- cles  were  selected  for  each  bank  that  had  fewer  than  eight  articles  in  a  year  to increase accuracy. For the rest, a total of eight plus 25 per cent of the remaining number of articles was randomly selected. In total, this sampling procedure yielded 1277 articles. Coding the articles entailed identifying and rating recording units (Weber, 1990). A recording unit was deﬁned as the evaluation of an individual bank in a single article  in  terms  of its  legitimacy. Because  many  articles  mention  several  banks, 2071 recording units were identiﬁed. Only 275 (13.3 per cent) were from letters, editorials, and  columns; the  rest  (86.7  per  cent)  were  from  news  articles. Each recording unit was given equal weight in the analysis, consistent with past research (Brown and Deegan, 1998; Dickson, 1992). To measure public legitimacy, each recording unit was rated as either endors- ing the bank or questioning its legitimacy, consistent with our earlier review (Hirsch and Andrews, 1984; Meyer and Scott, 1983; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). A record- ing unit was rated as questioning when there was evidence that the bank’s action, structure, mission, or  performance  was  being  questioned  or  challenged. Other- wise, the recording unit was rated as endorsing the bank. Annual measures for each bank were created using the Janis-Fadner coefﬁcient of imbalance (Coombs, 1992; Janis and Fadner, 1965). As implemented here, this measures the relative number of endorsing (e) and questioning (q) codes in a given year. Its formula is: © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 Organizational Legitimacy 341 Public legitimacy = - ( e * *2 eq Ï Ô Ì ÓÔ -( eq q* *2 total * *2 if e > q; ) ( ) 0 if e = q; ) ) ( total * *2 if q> e. The range of this variable is (-1, 1), where 1 indicates all endorsing coverage, -1 indicates all questioning coverage, and 0 indicates a balance between the two.[1] One author read and coded full text versions of all sampled articles. A colleague was instructed to use the same coding scheme on 23 per cent (52) of the articles from one year. The two raters agreed on 68 of the 71 recording units (95.8 per cent), suggesting high levels of intercoder reliability (Weber, 1990). Our sample size for analysing this dependent variable totalled 265, consisting of 96 different banks over 1988–92. Not all banks had media coverage each year. We address the statistical problem this raises below. Public reputation. Normative reputation represents the extent to which an organi- zation is viewed as better than other organizations in terms of societal norms and values. We again use the media to measure public norms and values for reasons similar  to  those  for  measuring  public  legitimacy. Communication  research  indi- cates a close alignment between media content and public opinion (Ader, 1995; Gamson et al., 1992; McCombs and Shaw, 1972). Past reputation research used the  media  to  measure  reputation  (e.g. Deephouse, 2000; Dutton  and  Dukerich, 1991), given  the  media  circulate  reputational  information  among  stakeholders (Fombrun, 1996). Moreover, the media has been important in creating the repu- tations of organizations of all types, including the well known rankings of busi- nesses (e.g. the Fortune ratings) and business schools published by different media outlets (Elsbach and Kramer, 1996; Fombrun, 1998). We call our variable public reputation. We  used  the  same  sample  of articles  used  to  measure  public  legitimacy  but applied a different coding scheme. Although one might question the appropriate- ness of measuring the two concepts from the same media sample, our approach is analogous to having a sample of individuals answering a survey that measures more than one concept, such as job satisfaction and self-efﬁcacy. That is, we follow past textual research that derived multiple themes and relationships from a par- ticular text or set of texts, such as propaganda (Lasswell et al., 1965) or news and discussion about industrial accidents (Gephart, 1993). We measured public reputation as follows. First, each recording unit was rated as positive, negative, or neutral, following Dominick’s (1981) study of network news coverage of business. A recording unit was rated positive when a bank was praised for  its  actions  or  associated  with  actions  that  past  research  indicated  should increase a ﬁrm’s reputation. Examples of the latter include: awards given to the © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 342 D. L. Deephouse and S. M. Carter bank or its employees (Fombrun, 1996); monetary or in-kind donations (Fombrun and  Shanley, 1990); and  director  linkages  to  other  organizations  (Weigelt  and Camerer, 1988). A  negative  rating  was  given  when  a  bank  was  criticized  for  its actions or was associated with actions that past research indicated should decrease a  ﬁrm’s  reputation. There  were  few  of the  latter, except  for  legal  or  regulatory charges. More often, an author or source criticized a bank’s actions. The essence of a  neutral  rating  was  the  reporting  of role  performance  without  evaluative  modiﬁers. Essential roles for banks included lending, holding deposits, purchasing from suppliers, trying to expand market share, etc. This rating was also given when there was a balance of positive and negative reporting. Annual measures for each bank were created using the Janis-Fadner coefﬁcient (Coombs, 1992; Janis and Fadner, 1965). As implemented here, this measures the relative number of positive (p) and negative (n) codes in a given year. Its formula is: Public reputation = ( Ï Ô Ì ÓÔ ( ) ( ) 0 if p = n; ) ) ( p * *2 pn - total * *2 if p > n; pn n * *2 - total * *2 if u > f. The range of this variable is (-1, 1), where 1 indicates all positive coverage, -1 indicates all negative coverage, and 0 indicates a balance between the two.[2] One author read and coded full text versions of all sampled articles. The afore- mentioned colleague also coded the sample for reputation. The two raters agreed on 65 of the 71 recording units (91.5 per cent). A second colleague coded 30 arti- cles from a different year, and the two raters agreed on 83.3 per cent of the codes. Together, these results suggest high levels of intercoder reliability (Weber, 1990). Independent Variables Strategic isomorphism. As noted above, past research has examined isomorphism on many organizational attributes, such as strategies, structures, and practices (Deep- house, 1996; Edelman, 1992; Fligstein, 1985, 1991). As  with  legitimacy  and  reputation, most empirical research focused on one attribute to limit the research design. We focus on strategy because of its central importance to for-proﬁt busi- nesses, an important sector for the application of institutional theory (Powell, 1991; Scott, 1994, 1995). Moreover, we follow conﬁgurational perspectives and assume that  strategy, structure, processes, culture, etc., are  generally  complementary (Meyer et al., 1993; Miller, 1981). Strategy is a concrete instantiation of an orga- nization’s  ‘central  orchestrating  theme’ (Miller, 1996)  and  may  be  linked  to  its interpretive  scheme  (Greenwood  and  Hinings, 1988; Ranson  et  al., 1980). Put another way, a company’s position in its product market is fundamentally related to its perspective in viewing the world (Mintzberg, 1987). For instance, a ‘prospec- © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 Organizational Legitimacy 343 tor’ may have an innovative culture that supports its exploratory product market approach (Miles et al., 1978). Bank strategies were measured using bank asset allocations, the commitment of resources  to  certain  product  markets  (Chandler, 1962; Santomero, 1984). Each allocation is measured as a proportion of total assets. For example, the commer- cial lending allocation is measured as the proportion of assets that a bank commits to commercial loans. Eleven bank asset allocations were included here: commer- cial loans, real estate loans, loans to individuals, agriculture loans, other loans and leases, cash, overnight money, securities, trading accounts, ﬁxed assets, and other assets. Reger et al. (1992), Haveman (1993) and Swamy et al. (1996) used similar categories to measure the strategies of banks and thrifts. We computed the strategic isomorphism of a bank with strategic conformity, which measures the extent to which an organization’s strategies resemble conven- tional strategies in an industry (Finkelstein and Hambrick, 1990). Each bank’s asset strategy was compared to the industry mean value for that strategy and expressed as a standard deviation. Because strategy is viewed holistically (Mintzberg, 1978), the absolute values of the standard deviations for all the asset allocation variables were  totalled  for  each  bank  to  produce  a  holistic  and  parsimonious  measure. Multiplying by –1 created a scale for which more positive values indicated greater isomorphism to strategic norms. This measurement procedure is consistent with institutional theory. DiMaggio and Powell (1983) and Scott (1995) suggested that standard  deviations  may  proxy  isomorphism  to  institutional  norms. Suchman (1994)  used  standardized  scores  to  measure  isomorphism  of legal  contracts  in Silicon Valley. Financial  performance. We  measured  ﬁnancial  performance  using  return  on  assets (ROA) because it was the most commonly used and well-regarded measure during our sample period (e.g. Gilbert, 1984; Mehra, 1996; Swamy et al., 1996). Reger et al. (1992, p. 195) stated: ‘Return on assets is the most meaningful ﬁnancial indi- cator in the banking industry and is the indicator most closely watched by bank analysts  and  the  bankers  themselves.’ ROA  measures  the  effectiveness  of man- agement’s  utilization  of its  assets  and  allows  comparison  between  banks  with  different  capital  structures  (Kidwell  and  Peterson, 1990). ROA  is  especially  appropriate for our sample because most banks were privately held so no stock market performance measures were available. We computed ROA as the ratio of net income to total average assets. Total average assets was the denominator, con- sistent with bank regulatory practice, because banks undertake ‘window dressing’ of their balance sheets at year-end and assets change over time. Control Variables Theory suggests that age and size may be positively related to both legitimacy and reputation. Although empirical evidence is mixed, we include these as control vari- © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 344 D. L. Deephouse and S. M. Carter ables. The length of time that an organization has been in business may be posi- tively related to both legitimacy and reputation (Aldrich and Auster, 1986; Baldi, 1997; Hannan and Freeman, 1984; Stinchcombe, 1965). Older organizations have established  roles, a  history  of successful  accomplishments, and  are  more  deeply embedded in networks of economic and social relationships. A bank’s age was mea- sured by subtracting the observation year by the bank’s founding year obtained from Polk’s Bank Directory, a standard bank reference. Larger organizations usually have more  contractual  and  social  ties  to  stakeholders, which  increases  their  visibility, status, and taken-for-grantedness (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Meyer and Rowan, 1977; Meznar and Nigh, 1995; Phillips and Zuckerman, 2001). Bank size was mea- sured using total average assets from the Call Reports. Average assets, number of employees, and market share are all correlated in excess of 0.93 in this sample. Data Analysis The propositions were tested using the following general statistical models. Legitimacy = b + + 0 + b * Total assets e 4 b * Strategic isomorphism b * ROA b * Age 1 2 3 + + + = Reputation c 0 + + c * Total assets e 4 c * Strategic isomorphism c * ROA c * Age 1 2 3 + + (1) (2) Because  the  measurement  properties  of our  dependent  variables  differ, we  use  different  statistical  techniques  to  estimate  these  models  and  test  the  hypotheses (Greene, 1993). Financial regulatory legitimacy is an ordered categorical variable. It is estimated using probit. Financial reputation is a continuous variable and is estimated using regression. Public legitimacy and public reputation are both cen- sored  variables  and  are  estimated  using  censored  regression  (i.e. tobit). All  data were standardized to allow coefﬁcients to be compared. Goodness of ﬁt tests were run on unstandardized data when necessary. The signiﬁcance of directional propo- sitions was assessed with one-tailed tests. Autocorrelation can be an issue in time series data. For our continuous measure of ﬁnancial reputation, OLS estimates yielded a Durbin-Watson statistic of 1.02. We  corrected  for  autocorrelation  using  the  Yule-Walker  method  of generalized least  squares  (GLS); results  using  maximum  likelihood  method  were  consistent. There are no comparable procedures for addressing autocorrelation among cen- sored or categorical dependent variables. Our conﬁdence in the reported results is enhanced because GLS estimates for ﬁnancial regulatory legitimacy were con- sistent with the probit estimates. Another important statistical issue arose when measuring public legitimacy and public reputation. Because not all banks were covered by the newspapers in every © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 Organizational Legitimacy 345 year, there was the possibility of sample selection bias (Heckman, 1979). That is, results based on the banks with media scores may not apply to all the banks in the period, raising generalizability concerns. We applied Heckman’s (1979) two-step procedure to correct for this bias. First, we estimated a dichotomous probit model estimating whether or not a bank had any media coverage. The probit estimates were used to create a variable called the ‘inverse Mills ratio’. We then added this variable to the structural regression models (above) to correct for sample selection bias. We further investigated our estimates in many ways. The major outcome of our model checking was the deletion of one outlying observation, Suburban National Bank in 1988, from our ﬁnancial reputation and regulatory legitimacy estimates. In our preliminary OLS estimate of ﬁnancial reputation, this observation had a studentized deleted residual of 32.7, well in excess of the second highest value of 3.9. A convenient statistical measure was not available for the probit and tobit esti- mates. Given the similarity of probit, OLS, and GLS estimates for ﬁnancial regu- latory legitimacy, we examined studentized deleted residuals from the OLS and found no major outliers. We relied on the residual plots for the tobit estimates that we  also  used  to  check  for  heteroskedasticity. There  were  no  dramatic  irregular- ities. Collinearity was not a problem for any of the models based on analysis of condition numbers (Belsley et al., 1980). RESULTS Table I presents the descriptive statistics and correlations for examining ﬁnancial regulatory legitimacy and ﬁnancial reputation during 1985–88. The sample size is 553. The correlation between these two variables is positive (r = 0.26) and sig- niﬁcant  (p < 0.001), which  is  not  unexpected  given  their  theoretical  similarities. Nevertheless, the bivariate explanatory power is less than 7 per cent (square of r = 0.26). ROA is correlated 0.30 and 0.55 with legitimacy and reputation, respec- tively. In bivariate terms, ROA explains 9 per cent and 30 per cent of the varia- tion. These  correlations  are  all  well  below  the  0.70  commonly  used  in organizational research to suggest that individual items measure the same concept (Nunnally, 1978). Table  II  presents  the  descriptive  statistics  and  correlations  when  examining public legitimacy and public reputation during 1988–92. The sample size is 265. The correlation between these two variables is positive (r = 0.30) and signiﬁcant (p < 0.001), as expected. Still, the bivariate explanatory power is only 9 per cent. ROA is correlated -0.03 (n.s.) and 0.15 (p < 0.05) with these measures of legiti- macy and reputation, respectively. These results clearly indicate that public legiti- macy, public reputation, and ROA are distinct.[3] Table III presents the probit estimates when ﬁnancial regulatory legitimacy is the  dependent  variable.

Table V presents the tobit estimates when public legitimacy and public reputation are the dependent variables. Propositions 1 and 2 focus on isomorphism as a way to distinguish legitimacy and reputation. In Model 1 of Table III, strategic isomorphism has a signiﬁcantly positive effect on ﬁnancial regulatory legitimacy (b = 0.203, p < 0.01). In Model 1 of Table V, strategic isomorphism has a signiﬁcantly positive effect on public legitimacy (b = 0.067, p < 0.05). Thus, there is support for Proposition 1. Proposition 2 predicts a positive relationship between isomorphism and repu- tation  for  organizations  with  lower  reputations  and  a  negative  relationship  for organizations  with  higher  reputations. This  suggests  that  the  signiﬁcant  positive relationship  between  isomorphism  and  ﬁnancial  reputation  for  the  full  sample (Model 1, Table IV) is driven by the positive relationship among banks with lower © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 Organizational Legitimacy 347 Table III.

We report in Models 2–4 the division that best informs middle status conformity theory. Model 2 has estimates for the ﬁrst quartile; the coefﬁcient for strategic isomorphism is signiﬁcantly positive (p < 0.05). Model 3 has estimates for the intermediate two quartiles; the coefﬁcient for strategic iso- morphism  is  not  signiﬁcantly  different  from  zero  (b = -0.005, SE = 0.065, p = 0.94). Model 4 has estimates for the highest quartile; the coefﬁcient for strategic isomorphism is negative and signiﬁcant at p = 0.054, which is not unreasonable for the sample size of 139. We compared the ﬁt of these sub-samples to the full sample reported in Model 1 using an F-test of structural change (Greene, 1993). Because the GLS transformation alters the R-squared statistics, we calculated the F-statistic  using  sum  of squared  errors  on  unstandardized  data. Splitting  the sample signiﬁcantly improved the ﬁt (F(12, 535) = 52.17; p < 0.001). Combined with the pattern of signiﬁcance for strategic isomorphism noted above, there is support for Proposition 2 for this dimension of reputation. The same cannot be said for public reputation. Creating split samples with the public reputation measure was problematic given its distribution. Many banks had only neutral coverage in a given year (110 of 265 observations.) Splitting the data at the median or either quartile produced only a modest level of signiﬁcance for strategic isomorphism in the highest quartile of public reputation (b = -0.172; SE = 0.120, p  < 0.10)  This  negative  relationship  is  consistent  with  the  view  that  © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 Organizational Legitimacy 349 deviation  by  higher  status  ﬁrms  may  help  their  reputation. We  also  divided  the sample into upper and lower groups at 0, inclusive, but no signiﬁcant results were found. Thus, there is minimal support for Proposition 2 connecting strategic iso- morphism and public reputation. Nevertheless, this non-signiﬁcant result does dis- tinguish  between  public  legitimacy  and  public  reputation. Taken  together, our results suggest that isomorphism has different relationships with two dimensions of legitimacy and reputation. We next turn to the effect of ﬁnancial performance on legitimacy and reputa- tion. Proposition 3 predicts that ﬁnancial performance has a positive effect on legiti- macy for lower levels of performance but no effect for higher levels. To test this, we bifurcated the samples at each quartile of ROA. For ﬁnancial regulatory legiti- macy, ROA is positive and signiﬁcant for the lowest quartile, half, and three quar- tiles of the sample. Models 2 and 3 of Table III report our results when splitting at the third quartile. Model 2 shows that ROA is positively associated with ﬁnan- cial regulatory legitimacy for banks below the third quartile (p < 0.001), whereas Model  3  shows  no  relationship  between  for  those  ﬁrms  in  the  highest  quartile. Splitting the sample in this way is a signiﬁcant improvement over the pooled model. The likelihood ratio test statistic equals 26.92 (c2(6); p < 0.001), providing support for Proposition 3 on this dimension. Support is not found for the public legitimacy data; no  signiﬁcant  results  for  ROA  are  found  for  the  whole  sample  (Model  1, Table V) or within any quartile.[4] Proposition 4 predicts that ﬁnancial performance has a positive relationship with reputation. The coefﬁcient for ROA in Model 1 of Table IV is positive and sig- niﬁcant. In  comparison  to  its  effect  on  legitimacy, we  expected  this  effect  to  be present for higher levels of ﬁnancial performance. Signiﬁcance when splitting at the third quartile (as reported for legitimacy) is p < 0.001 for the lower three quar- tiles and p < 0.05 for the highest quartile. For public reputation (Model 2, Table V), ROA is also positively related (b = 0.060; p < 0.05) for the full sample. Thus, there is support for Proposition 4. Taken together, our results suggest that ﬁnan- cial performance has different relationships with two dimensions of legitimacy and reputation. We also compared the relative effects of ﬁnancial performance on legitimacy and  reputation. Our  results  indicate  that  ﬁnancial  performance  has  a  stronger effect  on  reputation  than  legitimacy. The  testing  procedure  is  fairly  complex because  of the  dependent  variables. Details are reported in Appendix B. the  different  measurement  properties  of DISCUSSION Our starting point is the observation that legitimacy and reputation are receiving increased attention from researchers and practitioners, but there has been little to no attention to clarifying their conceptual differences, an important task in devel- © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 350 D. L. Deephouse and S. M. Carter oping  theory  (Kaplan, 1964; Stinchcombe, 1968; Wright, 1985). This  paper  theoretically distinguishes legitimacy and reputation by comparing their deﬁnitions and  by  examining  the  role  of isomorphism  and  ﬁnancial  performance  as antecedents. Empirical  support  is  found  for  two  types  of legitimacy  and  reputation. Concisely stating the deﬁnitional differences between legitimacy and reputation is difﬁcult given their complexity, yet such a statement can provide a basis for future research. Most deﬁnitions of legitimacy focused on the social acceptance resulting from adherence to regulative, normative, or cognitive norms that qualify one to exist. In contrast, most deﬁnitions of reputation focused on relative comparisons among  organizations  on  various  attributes  (see  especially  Lawrence, 1998; Ruef and Scott, 1998; Shenkar and Yuchtman-Yaar, 1997). The ability of these deﬁni- tions to distinguish the concepts is evident in the moderate correlations between our measures of legitimacy and reputation and the different regression results. This study also examines how two key antecedents theoretically and empirically differ in their relationship to two dimensions of legitimacy and reputation. Our expectations for isomorphism are by and large met: three of four tests support our propositions and the unsupported test is still indicative of a difference between the two concepts. Consistent with institutional theory and past research, we ﬁnd that isomorphism is positively related to both dimensions of legitimacy. Our study also sheds light on theories of status and conformity recently discussed by Phillips and Zuckerman (2001). Like them, we ﬁnd that organizations with the highest repu- tations  are  able  to  deviate  from  normal  strategic  behaviour  and  maintain  or improve  their  status, consistent  with  Hollander  (1958). Our  extension  to  this research examining low status organizations is also supported. We ﬁnd that in a situation where neighbouring contexts are limited, lower reputation organizations can improve their reputation by imitating the common strategies of the industry. Intermediate quartiles of ﬁnancial reputation appear to be a transition zone for conformity. These results hold for the ﬁnancial reputation dimension but not the public  reputation  dimension, however. Future  research  could  examine  if these results hold for other dimensions of reputation or for isomorphism on other orga- nizational attributes. Our expectations for ﬁnancial performance as a way to distinguish legitimacy and reputation are also by and large met: three of four propositions are supported and the unsupported test is still indicative of a difference between the two con- cepts. We extend prior theory by proposing and demonstrating that incrementally superior performance is not always required for obtaining and maintaining legiti- macy. Instead, an organization must have performance sufﬁcient to avoid ques- tions and challenges (Hirsch and Andrews, 1984; Meyer and Scott, 1983; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). We do not ﬁnd a relationship between ROA and public legiti- macy. Consistent  with  our  results, Westphal  et  al. (1997)  reported  that  hospital  performance did not affect normative legitimacy. We suggest further inquiry into © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 Organizational Legitimacy 351 the  relationship  between  ﬁnancial  performance  and  normative  legitimacy. For reputation, we  support  past  research  that  found  incrementally  superior  perfor- mance  improves  an  organization’s  relative  reputation  (Fombrun  and  Shanley, 1990). While  our  examination  shows  that  similar  antecedents  have  different  conse- quences for the legitimacy and reputation of organizations, future research could examine  the  degree  to  which  losing  legitimacy  and/or  reputation  will  interfere with a ﬁrm’s ability to operate effectively. Past research indicates that if a ﬁrm’s actions or structures do not meet social expectations, a ﬁrm can have its legitimacy questioned and challenged, and, in the extreme case, be judged illegitimate (Hirsch and Andrews, 1984; Meyer and Scott, 1983; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978). Market- oriented  organizations  facing  legitimacy  challenges  often  lose  their  unrestricted access to markets, limiting strategic choice and perhaps causing them to become non-players  in  certain  markets  (Brown, 1994, 1998; Phillips  and  Zuckerman, 2001). This is especially problematic when legitimacy challenges come from orga- nizations  that  exercise  coercive  power  or  mobilize  other  social  actors  (Stinch- combe, 1968; Weber, 1968). For example, a hospital lacking accreditation from the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations cannot par- ticipate  in  the  US  government’s  Medicare  programme  or  many  state  Medicaid programmes (Ruef and Scott, 1998; Westphal et al., 1997). In contrast, we suggest that the consequences of a lower reputation are less dire. Being less well regarded than another organization does not threaten the organi- zation’s  continued  existence  as  long  as  the  organization’s  legitimacy  remains unchallenged. The  lower  status  business  organization  does  not  lose  access  to markets, although it might have to reduce its prices to keep its customers (Podolny, 1993). Finally, and perhaps most importantly, having a lower reputation does not necessarily mean the organization will be challenged by the state or the collective action of powerful stakeholders. A case study of a legitimate and highly reputable organization that deviated so far as to lose legitimacy could inform practice and theory. And more generally, a further understanding of the complexities of man- aging legitimacy and reputation simultaneously should improve an organization’s ability to act in a more effective and informed manner. While the empirical analysis generally supports our theoretical framework, there are  several  limitations  that  warrant  inquiry  in  future  research. First, our  results may have been affected by the choice of one established industry and the selec- tion of two stakeholder groups, the ﬁnancial community and the general public. This  focus  was  necessary  to  ensure  that  we  could  observe  potential  differences between  legitimacy  and  reputation  without  the  complication  of multiple  indus- tries, dimensions, and stakeholders. Future research could examine if our distin- guishing criteria hold in other industries, such as embryonic, declining, or those facing legitimacy challenges (e.g. nuclear power in some countries). Notably, our results may not hold in industries where either competitive or institutional forces © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 352 D. L. Deephouse and S. M. Carter are weak. Moreover, future research could examine other dimensions of legitimacy and reputation. The potency of regulative, normative, and cognitive dimensions may vary by context. A  second  limitation  is  that  we  measured  reputation  using  a  ﬁnancial  ratio because of resource constraints (Sudman, 1976). This ratio was the most impor- tant indicator to bank rating agencies (Maloney, 1990) and served as a reputational signal to customers (Locher, 1992; Valvo, 1988). Also, our results are generally as expected. Nevertheless, future research could collect ratings from specialized infor- mation intermediaries in this or other industries (Fombrun, 1996). A  third  limitation  of our  study  is  that  each  newspaper  article  received  equal weight in constructing our measures of public legitimacy and public reputation, consistent  with  past  research  (e.g. Brown  and  Deegan, 1998; Dickson, 1992). Future research could examine different weighting approaches. Such an inquiry would require theory development in at least two areas (Shoemaker and Reese, 1996). The ﬁrst, pertaining to media effects, is the relative impact on audiences  of different  types  of articles, such  as  editorials  versus  news  stories. This  could  be  extended  to  include  position  on  the  front  page  of a  section, the  presence  of photographs, etc. The second area for theory development, pertaining to media content, is explaining why certain banks get covered in different ways. A fourth limitation of our study is that we only measured isomorphism using standard deviation units that were equally weighted across all asset categories, fol- lowing DiMaggio and Powell (1983), Finkelstein and Hambrick (1990), Suchman (1994), and Scott (1995). Different weightings could be used, and we considered some of these in the context of the probit model for ﬁnancial regulatory legiti- macy. One possibility is that deviations on the larger assets (e.g. real estate lending) may be more important because they would be more likely to be noticed. This is not true in our sample. Instead, we found that legitimacy is affected by a lack of isomorphism  on  smaller  asset  categories  with  high  coefﬁcients  of variation  (e.g. trading assets). Consistent with this, Porac et al. (1989) found that most Scottish knitwear ﬁrms followed the ‘Hawick Mind’, but the few that added more sporty lines like cotton golf sweaters had questions raised about them. Also, there may be less consensus about the range of acceptable behaviour for smaller, more sec- ondary attributes compared to larger, core attributes (Deephouse, 1999; Lawrence, 1998). Future  research  could  investigate  different  measures  of isomorphism  and their possibly differing effects on different types of legitimacy and reputation. The  variety  of possible  empirical  approaches  necessitates  further  theoretical  development. A ﬁfth limitation is that strict causality cannot be inferred. Our regression model implies that isomorphism and ﬁnancial performance inﬂuence legitimacy and rep- utation, following DiMaggio and Powell (1983), Shrum and Wuthnow (1988), and Fombrun and Shanley (1990). To assess the temporal precedence component of causality, we replaced contemporaneous measures of ROA and strategic isomor- © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 Organizational Legitimacy 353 phism with the prior year’s measures. Consistent results are found for these smaller samples. Still, the causal direction may be reversed for ﬁnancial performance, fol- lowing resource dependence theory (Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978) and the resource- based view of the ﬁrm (Hall, 1992). Together, these theories imply more complex relationships among performance, legitimacy, and reputation. Our study cast light on the distinctiveness of legitimacy and reputation that is necessary for examin- ing these more complex relationships (Kaplan, 1964). To conclude, this paper ﬁnds theoretical and empirical support for three key dif- ferences between legitimacy and reputation. In terms of deﬁnitions, we contrast legitimacy’s social acceptance resulting from adherence to regulative, normative and cognitive expectations with reputation’s comparisons among organizations on various attributes. Isomorphism appears critical for legitimacy but may have more complex relationships with reputation. Although ﬁnancial performance is beneﬁ- cial  for  both, for  higher  performing  ﬁrms. Future research can expand upon these distinguishing characteristics and elaborate  further  differences  and  relationships  between  these  two  important  concepts. its  beneﬁt  for  legitimacy  may  taper  off NOTES *An earlier version was presented at the annual meeting of the Academy of Management. We wish to  thank  Tima  Bansal, Charles  Fombrun, Ian  Gellatly, Royston  Greenwood, Carter  Hill, Bob Hinings, Andrew  Luchak, Michael  Mauws, Stephen  Mezias, Kevin  Mossholder, Craig  Russell, Michael Sturman, and Linnea Van Dyne for their comments on prior drafts of this manuscript. The reviewers and editors of JMS were also very helpful in developing the ﬁnal version. We also appre- ciate the technical assistance of Luke Cashen, Robin Cheramie, Anita Heck, Amy Hietapelto, Carter Hill, Marcia Simmering, and Grace Wang. [1] We considered using a simpler coefﬁcient, equal to the difference between the number of endors- ing and questioning recording units, divided by the total number of recording units. We did not use this measure because the convergence criterion was questionable in the censored regression analyses, the appropriate statistical technique for this type of range restricted variable. Never- theless, results were consistent with those presented below, which is not surprising given the 0.99 correlation between the two measures. [2] Similar  to  public  legitimacy, we  also  tested  the  simpler  ratio  of the  difference  between  the number of positive and negative recording units, divided by the total. The two are correlated 0.96, and  results  are  similar. We  use  the  Janis-Fadner  coefﬁcient  for  consistency  with  public  legitimacy. [3] There are 51 observations in 1988 that have measures of all four dependent variables. Public legitimacy is correlated 0.00 and 0.21 with ﬁnancial regulatory legitimacy and ﬁnancial reputa- tion, respectively. Public reputation is correlated 0.13 and 0.33 with ﬁnancial regulatory legiti- macy and ﬁnancial reputation, respectively. Given the small sample size, only the last correlation is signiﬁcant (p < 0.05). The magnitudes again indicate that the different measures of legitimacy and reputation are distinct. We note that 47 of 51 observations for ﬁnancial regulatory legiti- macy are in the highest category, with the other four in the intermediate category. [4] As part of our investigation, we examined if ROA has a stronger relationship with the lowest and  intermediate  levels  of ﬁnancial  regulatory  legitimacy  than  it  does  with  intermediate  and highest  levels. To  avoid  double-counting  the  intermediate  category, we  divided  randomly  the intermediate category to estimate the two models. To create statistical tests, we used a bootstrap procedure with 500 iterations (Efron, 1979; Freedman and Peters, 1984). Splitting the sample in this way is superior to the pooled model (LR = 226.4, chi-squared (4), p < 0.001). Moreover, although both ROA coefﬁcients are signiﬁcantly positive, the coefﬁcient for the lower legitimacy © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 354 D. L. Deephouse and S. M. Carter group is signiﬁcantly greater at p < 0.08 (Db = 0.503 - 0.149 = 0.354, SE(Db) = 0.250; t = 1.42, n = 51, conservatively using the smaller sample size). Thus, ﬁnancial performance may be less important as legitimacy increases.

APPENDIX B Comparison of the Effect of Financial Performance on Legitimacy and Reputation We also investigated the relative effects of ﬁnancial performance on legitimacy and reputation, suspecting it would more strongly affect reputation than legitimacy. To be seen as legitimate, an organization must have sufﬁcient ﬁnancial performance to meet societal expectations that qualify it to be an ongoing business organiza- tion and avoid questions or performance challenges (Czarniawska-Joerges, 1989; Dowling and Pfeffer, 1975; Hirsch and Andrews, 1984; Lawrence, 1998; Meyer © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 Organizational Legitimacy 355 and Scott, 1983). However, superior ﬁnancial performance can help to discrimi- nate among ﬁrms in determining status hierarchies (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). Combining  this  with  Suchman’s  (1995, pp. 573–4)  deﬁnition  of legitimacy  as  a ‘generalized perception or assumption’, we infer that stakeholders make less ﬁne- grained evaluations for legitimacy than for reputation. Testing this requires that the coefﬁcients for ROA be compared between equa- tions  1  and  2. Because  some  dependent  variables  have  different  measurement scales and thus were estimated by different methods, comparing all coefﬁcients is problematic. Past research suggested that using regression in place of probit might not  be  a  serious  problem  because  of the  robustness  of least  squares  regression (Labovitz, 1970; Michel and Hambrick, 1992). We assessed this by estimating all models using GLS and comparing the results to the original probit or tobit esti- mates. For ﬁnancial regulatory legitimacy, the pattern of signiﬁcance for the GLS estimate  was  similar  to  the  probit  estimate. The  GLS  estimates  for  public  legitimacy  and  public  reputation  were  not  consistent  with  the  tobit  estimates, however, so we did not directly compare the ﬁnancial-regulatory and normative dimensions. To enhance our comparisons, we created a categorical variable from the sorted ﬁnancial reputation variable that has the exact same distribution as the ﬁnancial regulatory legitimacy variable. Probit estimates for this were similar to the GLS estimates, so we also compared the probit coefﬁcients for ROA. Similar patterns were found when splitting the sample at the 75th percentile of ROA. Goodness of ﬁt tests (available from the authors) show that pooling the data for each estimator signiﬁcantly reduced model ﬁt, indicating that ﬁnancial regulatory legitimacy and ﬁnancial reputation behave differently. We tested the differences statistically using a Wald test (Greene, 1993; Judge et al., 1985). Table AI presents our comparison of coefﬁcients for ROA when ﬁnan- cial regulatory legitimacy and ﬁnancial reputation were dependent variables. In all cases, the coefﬁcients for ROA are signiﬁcantly larger when ﬁnancial reputa- tion was the dependent variable. Signiﬁcance levels are less than 0.01 for the full sample and the lowest three quartiles of ROA. With the 139 observations with the highest ROA, the signiﬁcance levels are still 0.02 and 0.05. The ROA coefﬁcients for  public  legitimacy  and  public  reputation  are  reported  in  Table  V. The  ROA coefﬁcient for public reputation exceeds the ROA coefﬁcient for public legitimacy by 0.074, which is signiﬁcant (Wald t = 1.61, p < 0.05). © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2005 356 D. L.
