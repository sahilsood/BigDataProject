This study employs a customer interaction approach to examine how service organizations'  strategic positioning relates to their human capital, and how the interaction between strategic  positioning and human capital impacts organizational performance. Results from 234 service  organizations in 96 different industries indicate very strong relationships between strategic  positioning choices and human capital. We also find that certain combinations of strategic  positioning and human capital result in superior performance. Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley &  Sons, Ltd.  There has been a great deal of discussion in the  literature concerning the nature of service firms  (e.g., Brush and Artz, 1999; Lovelock and Yip,  1996; Mills, 1986; Nayyar, 1993; Normann, 1984).  Some scholars suggest that these organizations are  unique (i.e., different than manufacturers) and, as  such, require the development of new models in  order to further our understanding of them (e.g.,  Mills et al, 1983). Others believe that any differ  ences that exist do so in degree rather than in kind,  and therefore existing organizational models are  robust enough to incorporate any nuances found  in the service sector of the economy (e.g., Bharad  waj, Varadarajan, and Fahy, 1993). Regardless of  this debate, there does appear to be general agree  ment that differences do exist between service and  manufacturing in a few specific areas. One of the  most often cited of these is customer interaction  with the production process (Kotier, 1983; Nor  mann, 1984).

E-mail: bskag2@uky.edu  Accordingly, scholars have begun to focus on  how the interaction between the customer and the  firm influences elements of the production pro  cess. For example, in an examination of emer  gency room units, Argote (1982) found that the  greater the variety of patient conditions treated,  the more nonprogrammed the decisions are dur  ing service production. This finding is consistent  with Jones' (1987) examination of small, mid  western service firms where he found a positive  relationship to exist between the level of uncer  tainty surrounding the customer-firm interaction  and the level of service production complexity.  Furthermore, each of these authors strongly indi  cates that strategy acts as the driving force behind  the level of customer-induced uncertainty. That is,  the service firm's strategic positioning dictates the  type of information required from customers dur  ing the interaction and, hence, the corresponding  level of uncertainty that confronts the production  process (Argote, 1982; Jones, 1987). Thus, these  studies support the idea that strategic positioning  choices influence the level of uncertainty that cus  tomers bring to the organization's production pro  cess.

Skaggs and M. Youndt  their production processes in order to effectively  cope with the level of uncertainty generated by  the customer interaction (Jones, 1987; Mills and  Moberg, 1982; Shostack, 1987; Tansik, 1990).  Of the elements that comprise service produc  tion, human capital, or the skills, knowledge, and  expertise of employees (Becker, 1964, Schultz,  1971), is believed to be one of the most impor  tant (e.g., Mills, 1986; Quinn, 1992). Unlike that  in manufacturing firms, customers of service firms  typically interact with the production process (Nor  mann, 1984). And since production in services  is typically dominated by labor, customers have  a high degree of interaction with the production  employees of the firm (Mills, 1986). Moreover,  any uncertainty that customers interject into the  process is being confronted in large part by these  production employees (Mills and Morris, 1986).  Thus, if service firms alter elements of the pro  duction process to handle varying levels of strate  gically induced customer uncertainty as previous  studies have suggested (e.g., Jones, 1987), then  this has important implications for human capital  investment decisions.  Unfortunately, very little attention has been  directed at exploring the interaction of strategic  positioning and human capital in service organi  zations. Furthermore, of those studies that have  examined this relationship (e.g., Boxall and Steen  eveld, 1999; Delery and Doty, 1996; Hitt et al,  2001), none have considered the impact of the cus  tomer interaction. While these studies are impor  tant first steps, the general dearth of research in  this area is a bit surprising given the dependence of  service organizations on human capital. Moreover,  since employees of service organizations tend to be  linked to customers during service delivery, they  play a key part in carrying out the strategic initia  tives of these firms. Thus, we believe that by taking  into account the presence of the customer during  service production, we can yield valuable insights  for researchers and practitioners concerning the  linkages among strategic positioning, human cap  ital, and organizational performance in service  organizations. As a result, managers of these firms  may be better able to implement strategic deci  sions as well as make more effective investments  in human resources. Likewise, researchers would  be granted a better understanding of the dynamics  driving human capital decisions in service firms, a  sector of the U.S. economy which now represents  over 75 percent of both employment and GPD  (United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1997).  In the following sections we begin by arguing  that different strategic positioning choices impact  the customer interaction with the firm. In particu  lar, we suggest that strategic positioning choices by  service firms will influence the potential variance  in customer demands (i.e., the range of customer  needs) that clients impose on a firm's production  process, which in turn requires varying levels of  human capital in order to deal with the correspond  ing uncertainty. Using this notion of variance in  customer demands as the organizing principle, we  then examine the specific relationships between  strategic positioning and human capital in ser  vice firm production. Next, we explore whether  the hypothesized relationships between strategic  positioning and human capital yield superior orga  nizational performance. Lastly, we discuss how  managers and researchers can use our findings in  their organizations and future research endeavors.  THEORY AND HYPOTHESES  Customer interaction, strategic positioning,  and human capital  As customers of a service firm interact with its  production process, the variance in their demands  creates uncertainty for the organization (Argote,  1982; Mills and Moberg, 1982; Tansik, 1990). In  response, service organizations may alter aspects  of production in order to process the required  levels of uncertainty. As stated above, a major  element of service production is human capital.  When customers introduce a high degree of vari  ability into the service production process, service  organizations may be able to address this vari  ability (i.e., successfully satisfy customer needs)  when their employees are proficient at diagnosing  problems, thinking creatively, developing novel  solutions, and so on; that is, when they possess  high levels of skill, knowledge, and expertise (i.e.,  human capital). This is consistent with human cap  ital theory, which contends that employees with  high skill levels can better cope with uncertainty in  the task environment (e.g., Becker, 1964; Schultz,  1971; Snell and Dean, 1992). In the present case,  this uncertainty is the result of variability in cus  tomer demands (Jones, 1987).  Though variability in customer demands may  influence human capital requirements, it has been  Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  Strat. Mgmt.

According to  the positioning view of strategy, firms undertake  strategic positions in order to differentiate them  selves from existing and potential competitors  along dimensions that are of importance to cus  tomers (e.g., Porter, 1980, 1996). Since much of  what customers purchase from a service firm is a  process (Normann, 1984), and since they are inter  acting with that process, differences in the produc  tion process itself allow for differentiation among  competing firms (Mills, 1986; Shostack, 1987).  Three key differentiating mechanisms involving  the production process that have been discussed in  the services literature are customer co-production,  customer contact, and service customization (e.g.,  Heskett, 1986; Mills, 1986). All service firms  undertake each of these to varying degrees (Nor  mann, 1984). Furthermore, since these mecha  nisms are difficult for service firms to change in  the short term (Mills, 1986), they represent strate  gic elements to these organizations.  Customer co-production  As customers actively engage in the production  of the service, they are expending effort. Ser  vice firms can alter this aspect of service cre  ation, known as customer co-production, to differ  entiate themselves from competitors by offering  their services in a manner that requires greater  or lesser amounts of effort on the part of cus  tomers (an option which very few manufacturing  firms possess) (cf. Maister and Lovelock, 1982;  Mills, 1986; Upah, 1980). For example, some ser  vice firms require customers to wait for service  (first come, first served), to receive service only  at a specific time (3:00 check-in), or to perform  various tasks (e.g., bus tables, carry your own  luggage). These are instances of high customer  co-production. Other service organizations may  choose to position their service in a manner that  reduces customer effort (e.g., free pick-up service,  use of a loaner car, meals provided on a flight).  As a firm utilizes higher levels of co-production  it tends to reduce the range of customer needs  that it must address (e.g., Mills and Morris, 1986).  For example, some tax preparation firms may  have customers sort receipts into predefined cate  gories, thereby diminishing the potential breadth of  demands customers may impose on the firm. The  use of these predefined categories creates a routine  input for the organization, reducing the amount of  uncertainty that is encountered in the task environ  ment during service production (e.g., Scott, 1992;  Thompson, 1967). This reduction in uncertainty  affords the firm a relatively predictable task envi  ronment, which allows it to codify and simplify  much of its production process. As a result, we  argue that the level of human capital required of  a service firm's production employees would be  reduced. Accordingly, we anticipate:  Hypothesis 1: Customer co-production will be  negatively related to human capital.  Customer contact  Whereas customer co-production concerns the  level of effort customers are expending during  service production, customer contact refers to the  degree of interaction they have with a firm's  production process (Mills, 1986). As firms increase  this degree of interaction, they can decrease  response time in addressing customer needs.  However, greater levels of interaction heighten  the information flows between the customer and  the organization, providing customers with a  mechanism for injecting substantial amounts of  uncertainty into the service production process  (Mills, 1986; Mills and Morris, 1986; Tansik,  1990). Furthermore, as the level of interaction  increases, more areas of the production process  can become exposed to the customer, thereby  increasing the number of points in which the  customer may inject variability. Together, we  suggest these will increase the need for effective  information processing during service production.  More specifically, as firms increase the level of  customer contact, we suggest their production  employees will need a more enhanced skill  set for dealing with customers, understanding  idiosyncratic situations, making quick decisions,  and so on. Conversely, if the service production  process is designed to minimize customer contact,  less human capital will most likely be required. As  such, we expect:  Hypothesis 2: Customer contact will be posi  tively related to human capital.  Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  Strat. Mgmt.

Youndt  Service customization  Service firms also differentiate themselves in the  competitive marketplace by the extent to which  they customize the service offering for individ  ual customers (Heskett, 1986; Normann, 1984).  As a firm increases the possibility of meeting  each customer's specific needs, it faces greater  levels of potential demand variability, which in  turn increases the level of uncertainty that is  encountered during service production (Tansik,  1990). Accordingly, we believe the decisions a  firm makes concerning customization will in turn  affect its human capital considerations. High lev  els of customization require production employees  to ascertain varying customers' needs, decide on  the particular procedures required to fulfill those  needs, and choose the most appropriate produc  tion path through the organization (Shostack, 1987;  Tansik, 1990; Wathen, 1995). On the other hand,  low levels of customization allow for service pro  duction to be routinized, thereby reducing the need  for judgment on the part of production employees.  In short, as customization increases we expect ser  vice firms to cope with this strategically induced  uncertainty in the production process through the  use of greater levels of human capital. Therefore,  we anticipate:  Given the costs, it is suggested that efficient firms  will make just enough of an investment in human  capital to handle a given level of customer variabil  ity (cf. Williamson, 1979). This is consistent with  Argote's (1982) finding that hospital emergency  rooms that achieved a fit between the level of coor  dination and the variance in customer demand gave  more effective treatment. Therefore, we suggest  that service firms that possess a match between  their strategic positioning and human capital will  have greater performance; that is, human capital  will moderate the relationship between strategic  positioning and firm performance. Thus, based on  the expected associations between strategic posi  tioning and human capital detailed in Hypotheses  1, 2, and 3, we suggest the following moderation  relationships:  Hypothesis 4: Human capital will negatively  moderate the relationship between customer co  production and firm performance.  Hypothesis 5: Human capital will positively  moderate the relationship between customer  contact and firm performance.  Hypothesis 6: Human capital will positively  moderate the relationship between service cus  tomization and firm performance.  Hypothesis 3: Service customization will be pos  itively related to human capital.  METHODS  Strategic positioning, human capital, and  performance  Service organizations are open social systems that  interface with internal and external sources of  uncertainty (Argote, 1982). For the production  processes of service firms, a large part of this  uncertainty lies in their interactions with customers  (Argote, 1982; Jones, 1987; Tansik, 1990). We  have hypothesized that service firms may invest in  human capital so that their employees are capable  of dealing with the potential variance in customer  demands generated by their strategic positioning.  However, investing in human capital can be a  costly endeavor (e.g., Tushman and Nadler, 1978).  The greater the variance in customer demands,  the more sophisticated the skills needed to trans  form a wider variety of inputs into the service  offering. This sophistication gives rise to increased  costs in terms of factors such as higher levels of  training, higher levels of education, and the like.  Sample  In constructing the study sample, we considered  only those service firms that were publicly held  in order to obtain objective performance data.  We then used a size criterion of greater than  $10 million in sales and larger than 50 employ  ees in order to increase the likelihood the orga  nizations possessed somewhat formalized strategic  and HR activities. Finally, we limited our sam  ple to only those firms that received a majority  of their sales from a single industry to reduce  the possibility of multiple strategic positioning and  human capital investment choices occurring within  a firm. This screening process yielded 1904 service  organizations. Questionnaires were mailed in late  1997 and early 1998 to the highest-ranking exec  utive in each firm (usually the CEO, but in a few  cases the President or Chief Operating Officer).  Though some have voiced concern over the use  of a single respondent (e.g., Simon and Burstein,  Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  Strat. Mgmt. J., 25: 85-99 (2004) This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 20:10:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  Strategie Positioning, Human Capital, and Performance 89  1985), our decision to use a single respondent was  based on two characteristics of the present study.  First, all firms predominately compete in a single  industry. Thus, top mangers should have a greater  understanding of their firm's competitors, industry  dynamics, and their own strategic positioning than  would managers of diversified organizations. Sec  ond, because service firms possess relatively high  concentrations of labor (i.e., labor is a primary firm  resource) (Mills, 1986), it is likely that top man  agers of these types of organizations will have an  in-depth knowledge of their human capital. Thus,  we believe these characteristics help to minimize  the concerns of using a single respondent.  A total of 234 organizations representing 96  four-digit SIC codes returned questionnaires (see  Table 1 for a listing of the sample by industry  group). An analysis of respondent-nonrespondent  organizational differences based on the number  of employees and performance showed the two  groups were not significantly different on either  of these dimensions.  Measures  A pilot study involving 23 service firms from  four industries was conducted to ascertain the  validity and reliability of the survey instrument.  Similar to the main study, all firms had greater  than $10 million in annual sales and 50 or more  employees. Alterations and clarifications were  made to the questionnaire items based on responses  and input from the pilot study. Questions for  both the pilot and main studies were based on  Table 1. Correlations, means, and standard deviations  seven-point Likert scales, and the pilot study  organizations were not included in the sample of  the main study.  Strategic positioning  These variables consisted of customer co  production, customer contact, and service cus  tomization and were measured relative to com  petitors. Customer co-production is the degree to  which customers participate in the design and  delivery of the service offering (Maister and  Lovelock, 1982; Mills and Morris, 1986) and was  measured using a five-item scale (alpha = 0.77).  Customer contact refers to the degree to which  customers and employees interact with one another  during the service production process and was  measured with a two-item scale (alpha = 0.95).  Lastly, service customization refers to a firm's  ability to alter service production in order to  meet specific customer needs and was measured  using a five-item scale (alpha = 0.89). See the  Appendix for a list of the specific strategic posi  tioning variable items.  Organizational performance  Performance was measured using two variables:  return on equity (ROE) and return on investment  (ROI). A 2-year average of both ROE and ROI  was used in order to reduce the potential for  anomalous timing effects on performance.

Youndt  overall performance variable (alpha = 0.72). ROE  and ROI data were obtained from Disclosure.  Human capital  Organizations can increase their human capital  levels through selection and/or training (i.e., buy  and/or make). Selection refers to an organization's  efforts to increase its human capital by hiring  employees with high levels of education and exper  tise from the external labor market. Training, on  the other hand, refers to an organization's effort to  increase its human capital through internal devel  opmental activities of its current employees (Snell  and Dean, 1992). While human capital theory can  be used to argue that selection and training are  substitutes for one another and therefore redun  dant when used together, many studies have found  them to be complementary (MacDuffie, 1995; Pfef  fer, 1994; Youndt et al, 1996). It is logical to  conceive, for example, that organizations can use  selection to increase their generic human capital,  while focusing on training to develop firm-specific  human capital.  Following the complementary approach com  monly employed by strategic human resource man  agement researchers studying high-performance  work systems (e.g., Arthur, 1994; Huselid, 1995;  MacDuffie, 1995; Youndt et al, 1996), we used  a composite selection and training scale consist  ing of five items to assess the level of human  capital possessed by the organization's employ  ees directly involved in the service production and  delivery process (alpha = 0.85). More specifically,  the items focused on whether or not firms select  production employees with high levels of prior  education, training, and experience, and how much  time and money they spend on internal training  activities. Similar to the strategic positioning mea  sures, these items were assessed relative to com  petitors. See the Appendix for the specific human  capital items.  Control variables  Previous studies have indicated that firm size and  industry environment can influence firm perfor  mance (e.g., Keats and Hitt, 1988). To control for  the effects of size, we gathered data on the num  ber of individuals employed by each firm. Number  of employees was used rather than total revenue,  as researchers believe it to be a more accurate  proxy of size in the service sector (cf. Normann,  1984). We then calculated the log of this number  and entered it in the first step in our regression  analyses.  In order to control for industry effects, we first  collected data using Research Insight on aver  age ROE and ROI for each of the 96 four-digit  SIC codes represented in the study. We com  bined these into an overall measure of industry  performance to be consistent with the compos  ite nature of our firm performance variable. Next,  to control for the effects of industry risk, we  obtained the industry beta for each of the 96 indus  tries from Research Insight. Finally, we incorpo  rated information asymmetry into the analysis for  two reasons. First, past data suggest the level of  information asymmetry in the environment may  impact industry-level profitability (e.g., Nayyar,  1990) as well as firm strategy (Nayyar, 1993; Nay  yar and Templeton, 1994). Second, the inclusion  of information asymmetry helps account for any  effects industry complexity/knowledge intensive  ness might have on human capital investments. To  assess information asymmetry, we used a four-item  scale that measured customers' abilities to ascer  tain the underlying quality of the service offering  as well as their ability to differentiate among the  output of competing firms (alpha = 0.90). See the  Appendix for a list of the specific information  asymmetry items.  Confirmatory factor analysis of all the self  reported constructs suggested that the model  provided a good fit to the data. The CFA resulted  in a chi-square statistic of 150 with 51 degrees  of freedom. Since the chi-square was less than  three times the degrees of freedom, a good  fit was implied (Carmines and Mclver, 1981).  Furthermore, other measures of the fit indexes all  exceeded the critical levels suggested by B entier  and Bonett (1980) (comparative fit index = 0.983;  goodness-of-fit index = 0.912; incremental fit  index = 0.983). Construct reliability was assessed  by calculating Cronbach's alpha for each of the  constructs. All of the scales reached the 0.70a  suggested by Nunnally (1978). Moreover, the  standardized loadings of all measurement items  to their respective constructs were significant at  the p < 0.05 level, suggesting that the scales for  the constructs had convergent validity (Montoya  Weiss, Massey, and Song, 2001). In addition,  none of the confidence intervals of the phi  values contained a value of one {p < 0.01),  Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  Strat. Mgmt.

RESULTS  Strategic positioning and human capital  Correlations, means, and standard deviations of  all variables are shown in Table 1. To test our  strategic positioning-human capital hypotheses (1  through 3), we used ordinary least squares regres  sion analysis. In doing so, we regressed the vari  able human capital on the three main effects (cus  tomer co-production, customer contact, and ser  vice customization) as well as on the two control  variables (firm size and information asymmetry).  Results of this analysis are shown in Table 2.  Hypothesis 1 suggested a negative relation  ship between customer co-production and human  capital. The results support this hypothesis (b =  ?0.300, p < 0.01). This finding upholds our asser  tion that higher levels of customer co-production  act to standardize customer inputs into the pro  duction process, thereby reducing the need for  higher levels of human capital among a firm's pro  duction employees. This finding is also consistent  with those who make the corollary argument that  increased co-production may allow firms to shift  production activities to customers.  Hypothesis 2 suggested a positive relationship  between customer contact and human capital. The  results also confirm this contention (b = 0.194,  p < 0.01). This finding supports the argument that  service organizations with high levels of customer  contact in the production and delivery process  require greater levels of human capital in order  to handle the increased uncertainty brought about  Table 2.

As such, increased investments  in human capital are needed.  In Hypothesis 3, we argued there would exist  a positive relationship between service customiza  tion and human capital. Again, the results support  this contention (b = 0.212, p < 0.01). Thus, there  is strong evidence to suggest that service orga  nizations with adaptable production and delivery  processes are investing heavily in human capital  so that employees can process the corresponding  variance in customer demands.  Strategic positioning, human capital, and  performance  In order to test our hypotheses examining how the  'fit' between strategic positioning and human cap  ital influences organizational performance (Hypo  theses 4, 5, and 6), we used moderated hier  archical regression analysis. In step 1 of this  analysis, we entered the control variables (size,  industry performance, industry beta, and informa  tion asymmetry) and the main effects variables  (customer co-production, customer contact, ser  vice customization, and human capital). Significant  effects here indicate direct relationships between  these variables and organizational performance.  This procedure eliminates any main effects on  performance prior to examining potential strate  gic positioning-human capital interaction, or fit,  effects (Stone and Hollenbeck, 1989). In step 2, the  cross-products of each of the strategic positioning  variables and human capital (e.g., customer co  production x human capital ) were entered as a set.  Entering the interaction terms simultaneously aids  in controlling for possible multicollinearity among  the variables. Evidence of moderation exists when  the set of interaction terms accounts for signif  icant residual variance in the dependent vari  able. A significant R2 change here indicates that  strategic positioning and human capital interact  to influence performance. To understand the spe  cific relationships between the strategic position  ing-human capital interactions and performance,  we then examined the individual interaction terms  in the regression equations.

The graphical  depiction of this relationship in Figure 1(b) reveals  that as customer contact increases, high levels of  human capital are associated with decreasing per  formance, while low levels of human capital are  linked to performance increases.  The results for our final hypothesis, Hypothe  sis 6, confirmed our prediction that service cus  tomization and human capital interact to affect  performance (b = 0.383, p < 0.001). As expected,  Figure 1(c) illustrates that the combination of high  levels of customization and human capital are  related to increased performance. Conversely, per  formance suffers substantially when increased ser  vice customization is coupled with low levels of  human capital.  As predicted in Hypothesis 4, customer co  production interacted with human capital to have  a statistically significant, negative relationship  with organizational performance (b = ? 0.145;  p < 0.05). A plot of this interaction in Figure 1(a)  confirms our belief that higher performance will  be associated with service organizations that  couple higher levels of customer co-production  with decreased human capital. On the other  hand, as these firms assume a larger portion of  service production (i.e., as customer co-production  decreases), increasing levels of human capital will  be linked to higher organizational performance.  The interaction between customer contact and  human capital was also significantly related to per  formance (b = ?0.170, p < 0.05).

Our performance analysis with regard to the cus  address this area by taking a customer interaction  approach to examining how certain strategic posi  tioning choices are related to human capital, and  how the interaction among strategic positioning  and human capital influences organizational per  formance.

As expected,  as co-production increases the performance ben  efit of high levels of human capital diminishes  substantially. Thus, on the surface it appears that  firms are behaving rationally by coupling higher  co-production with lower human capital (our result  from Hypothesis 1). However, a detailed inter  action plot (Figure la) shows that even though  there is a diminishing benefit to having high  human capital when co-production increases, firms  with high human capital always outperform those  with low human capital regardless of the level of  co-production. As such, under most co-production  choose to utilize more customer co-production  they are less likely to make investments  in human capital in their service production  processes.

Youndt  circumstances organizations would be wise to  employ high levels of human capital even though  the benefits of doing so are substantially reduced  under conditions of moderate to high co-production.  With regard to customer contact, we found a  very strong, positive link with human capital. This  finding implies that as customer-employee con  tact increases (i.e., as more of the production  process is exposed to customers), organizations  employ higher levels of human capital in order  to deal with the heightened information flows and  variability resulting from this increased interac  tion. While such organizational decisions appear  logical and were consistent with our predictions,  our interaction analysis (Figure lb) illustrates that  such a coupling can have detrimental performance  consequences. For example, combining low cus  tomer contact with low human capital results  in extremely low performance, whereas coupling  high human capital with the same low contact leads  to very high performance. With regard to high cus  tomer contact, organizations exhibited very similar  performance whether they utilized high or low lev  els of human capital when adopting this type of  strategic position.  One explanation for our unexpected findings  can be found in an offshoot of agency theory,  coined control theory (Snell, 1992). At its basic  level, control theory outlines mechanisms organi  zations can use to affect the behavior of employ  ees in a manner that serves the best interests of  the firm. Assuming that managers of service firms  are interested in meeting the needs of customers,  then investments in human capital through selec  tion and training can be used as a mechanism to  help ensure that employees have the proper skills  to meet these needs. This approach to employee  control is referred to as input control. Alterna  tively, firms can use behavioral control by directly  monitoring their employees to ensure that they are  acting in a manner consistent with meeting cus  tomer demands. We suggest that when customer  contact is high, it is possible that customers can  serve as extra-organizational monitoring agents for  service firms. Rather than requiring management  to monitor employee behavior, it is the customers  themselves that ensure their needs are met through  direct communication with production employ  ees. Due to this monitoring role by customers  brought about by a high degree of contact with the  production process, service organizations may be  able to economize on their level of investments in  human capital. Thus, firms employing high levels  of customer contact may be able to meet cus  tomer needs with either input control (i.e., higher  human capital) or behavioral control (i.e., lower  human capital). This would explain why we found  little performance differences among firms pursu  ing high levels of customer contact. When cus  tomer contact is low, however, behavioral control  through customer monitoring may not be possible  as customers' interactions with production employ  ees are reduced. In this case, service firms using  input control (i.e., higher human capital) would  most likely achieve higher performance. Though  this explanation is consistent with our results, it is  but one possible reason for our findings. For exam  ple, it is also possible that employees were not  given enough decision-making discretion to deal  with the added uncertainty brought about by high  customer contact, thereby reducing customer sat  isfaction and hence firm performance. Thus, much  more research is needed to fully understand the  effects of customer contact on human capital.  We also found a strong, positive relationship  between service customization and human capi  tal. Not surprisingly, service organizations employ  higher levels of human capital in their produc  tion processes when confronted by this poten  tial for substantial variance in customer demands.  Under such a condition, employees need to ascer  tain a customer's specific needs and determine  how to provide customized services that meet  those idiosyncratic needs. Our interaction results  (Figure lc) are consistent with this rationale and  highlight the importance of human capital to ser  vice customization. Organizations matching high  human capital with highly adaptable service pro  duction exhibited extremely high levels of perfor  mance, while companies using low human capital  with the same strategic position experienced severe  performance problems. On the other hand, when  service customization was low, organizations per  formed significantly better with low as opposed to  high levels of human capital. As one might expect,  it appears that service organizations with low cus  tomization may not be able to derive a requisite  amount of benefits to compensate for the additional  costs associated with high levels of human capital.

The only strategic posi  tioning variable with a direct effect on perfor  mance was service customization (b =?0.116,  p < 0.05). This negative performance effect seems  to suggest that service customization, unless pack  aged and implemented correctly, may be very  costly and/or not valued by consumers. That is,  service customization may have high production  and delivery costs without commensurate pricing  power and therefore erodes profit margins unless  coupled with the proper level of human capital.  The human capital variable itself had a very  strong, positive main effect on organizational per  formance (b = 0.325, p < 0.001). This result lends  considerable support to the basic argument that  human capital is vital to the production and deliv  ery processes of service organizations (e.g., Mills,  1986). Thus, all else being equal (e.g., strategic  positioning, industry environment), more human  capital appears to be better than less human capital.  This result is also consistent with the visual plots  of the performance effects of the strategic posi  tioning-human capital interactions. While theses  interactions revealed that certain strategic positions  required more or less human capital to maximize  performance, the graphs illustrated that high lev  els of human capital were better than low levels in  most service production contexts.  In controlling for the potential effects of infor  mation asymmetry, we noticed that it too was  significantly related to human capital.1 Interest  ingly, the relationship was negative (b = ?0.123,  p < 0.05). This is in direct contrast to what most  scholars have suggested, which is that industries  1 We would like to thank an anonymous reviewer for calling  attention to this relationship and encouraging us to investigate it  further.  with high levels of information asymmetry are  typically characterized by complex, knowledge  intensive tasks and hence require high levels of  human capital (Heskett, 1986; Normann, 1984).  Because of the contrary nature of this finding, we  decided to investigate the effect of the interaction  of information asymmetry and human capital on  performance. Our results indicated that the interac  tion was significant (b = ?0.160, p < 0.05); how  ever, the graphical depiction of the relationship  was again contrary to what one would expect based  on the literature. As highlighted in Figure 2, ser  vice firms utilizing high levels of human capital  in environments characterized by low information  asymmetry had correspondingly high performance,  while firms employing low levels of human capital  in the same environments possessed low perfor  mance. At the other end of the spectrum, the per  formance differences among firms taking either a  low or high human capital approach narrowed sub  stantially when the environment was characterized  by high information asymmetry.  One explanation for these results is the poten  tial effect of information asymmetry on the need  for organizational slack. Slack is typically con  ceptualized as excess resources that give firms a  greater ability to respond to unforeseen demands  (e.g., Thompson, 1967). In a service firm, invest  ments in human capital add to the level of orga  nizational slack, for they create a resource that  allows the firm to better cope with the potential  uncertainty customers bring to the service envi  ronment (Quinn, 1992). However, as information  asymmetry increases, customers are less able to  ascertain the underlying quality of the service  offering and therefore have a reduced understand  ing as to whether or not their demands are actu  ally being met (Normann, 1984).

Youndt  knowledge may therefore significantly decrease  the impact of a customer's demands upon the  service production process. In effect, information  asymmetry may act as a buffer between the firm  and its customers, allowing the firm to reduce its  investment in slack resources, which in this case  is human capital. In low information asymmetry  environments, however, there is not much of an  information buffer between the firm and its cus  tomers, thereby necessitating the use of high levels  of human capital. Much more research is needed to  fully understand the impact of information asym  metry on service organizations.  Limitations and additional future directions  One limitation of this study involves the tim  ing of the effects between strategic positioning  characteristics, investments in human capital, and  performance. Though we developed our customer  interaction arguments in terms of the impact of  strategic positioning on human capital and their  subsequent affect on organizational performance,  other directional influences are possible. For exam  ple, it is reasonable to contend that successful  organizations?regardless of the strategic posi  tioning characteristics they implement?have the  resources necessary to invest in human capital.  Likewise, it can also be argued that high levels of  human capital afford organizations the ability to  pursue various strategic alternatives. On the other  hand, firms currently exhibiting low performance  may invest in human capital and certain strategic  positions in order to improve their performance.  The cross-sectional nature of our study prohibits  us from excluding any of these possibilities. Future  research might look at strategic positioning charac  teristics, human capital, and performance over time  to examine the sequential and reciprocal relation  ships among these aspects of service organizations.  A second limitation involves the object of the  study. Consistent with our customer interaction  approach, our study focused on the service produc  tion and delivery process. This focus allowed us  to target a relatively homogeneous subpopulation  of an organization's employees, thereby increas  ing the accuracy of our human capital measure  ments. However, doing so limits the generaliz  ability of our results to the production process.  Future studies are needed to explore the linkages  between strategic positioning, human capital, and  performance in other subpopulations of employees  within service organizations. In a related matter,  scholars may also consider examining these inter  relationships in diversified firms, as we limited  our study to nondiversified organizations primarily  competing in a single industry.  A third limitation concerns the relationship  between organizations' decision-making structures  and the level of human capital in their production  processes. We have argued that as variability in  customer demands increases, service organizations  will increase the level of human capital involved in  the production process to address this uncertainty.  However, it is likely that these same production  employees will also require higher degrees  of autonomy so that they may address this  uncertainty. In the present study, we assumed  that managers would give the requisite amount of  decision-making power to production employees  depending on the level of variability they  encountered. If, however, managers did not grant  such authority to production employees, then  any potential returns from investments in human  capital may not materialize. For example, as  mentioned previously, our contrary performance  findings surrounding the customer contact-human  capital interaction may result from organizations  not providing the requisite amount of decision  making authority to their production employees.  This suggests there may exist both direct and  interaction effects among strategic positioning,  human capital, and the decision-making structure  that ultimately impact performance?effects that  were not accounted for in the present study. Due  to the potential impact of decentralization on a  service firm's ability to handle uncertainty, we  encourage future research in this area.  Besides these areas for future research, two  others are of note. The first concerns the role  of technology in service organizations. As stated  above, our study focused on the human capital  requirements surrounding the service production  process. Past research on production processes has  mostly examined the throughput aspect of produc  tion, in particular the use of technology in effi  ciency gains (e.g., Thompson, 1967; Woodward,  1965). However, in the present study we did  not measure technology. Instead, we assumed  it to be a multifaceted resource that is applied  to achieve efficiency gains in a manner consis  tent with the organization's strategic positioning.  Though this approach was theoretically consistent,  Copyright ? 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.  Strat. Mgmt.

Contin  uing advances in technology allow it to be used  in more difficult and complex tasks. Although our  results show strong support for our argument that  service firms use human capital to address vari  ability in customer demands, it is possible that  technology is playing an ever-increasing role in  allowing firms to contend with this uncertainty.  That said, the reality is we know very little about  the role of technology in services. For instance,  why is it that new technologies have brought forth  vast productivity gains in the manufacturing sec  tor, while very few gains have occurred in the  services (United States Bureau of Labor Statistics,  1997)? Another question involves the creation of  new technology by service firms. Much of what a  service firm sells is a process. When such a firm  develops a new process for delivering the service,  this is by definition a new technology. However,  processes are very difficult to patent. As such, new  technologies in services may be easily copied by  competitors, which in turn may reduce these orga  nizations' desire to invest in innovation. These  questions have only scratched the surface of poten  tial topics involving technology in the services. A  great deal more research is needed in this area.  The second area involves the skill level of cus  tomers. In the present study we assumed that all  customers possessed a similar level of skill. How  ever, it is likely that differences do exist among  customers based on their skill and/or knowledge  surrounding the service. For example, Nayyar and  Templeton (1994) suggest that expert buyers may  have a better familiarity with the service than  would novice clients. As such, expert customers  may be able to perform more complex tasks dur  ing service production, thereby reducing the need  for higher levels of human capital. In addition,  customer skill level could also impact the strate  gic options available to service firms. When cus  tomer skill level is very low, firms may encounter  difficulty in adopting a production process high  in customer co-production (i.e., one that requires  much effort on the part of customers). Finally,  the level of customer skill may also impact a  buyer's susceptibility to the effects of informa  tion asymmetry (Nayyar and Templeton, 1994).  For example, highly skilled customers may have  a better understanding of what constitutes quality  in the service offering. As such, this could have  implications for the level of slack resources in the  form of human capital that service firms require.  These are just a few examples of how customer  skill level can affect service organizations. Again,  much more research is needed.  CONCLUSION  Previous research on production and human cap  ital has typically focused on the nature of the  task. However, this body of research implicitly  assumes a separation between production and the  environment. Recent works have suggested that  in service environments a client-firm interaction  occurs that can create higher levels of uncertainty  for the firm. As a result of this interaction, ser  vice organizations must adapt elements of their  production processes to address this uncertainty.  The current study extends this idea by suggesting  that the strategic positioning of service production  determines the level of uncertainty arising from the  client-firm interaction, and hence the human capi  tal required to handle this uncertainty. In addition,  we found partial support for performance differ  ences among service firms as a result of their fit  between strategic positioning and human capital.  Thus, the findings in this study add to the grow  ing belief among researchers that a different set  of dynamics may be at work in service organiza  tions. With this sector of the economy account  ing for the vast majority of both employment and  gross domestic product in the United States, we  believe that more research in this area is war  ranted. We hope that the findings presented here  will encourage researchers to continue investigat  ing the dynamics driving these organizations.
