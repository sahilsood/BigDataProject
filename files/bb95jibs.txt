LINKS BETWEEN BUSINESS STRATEGY AND HUMAN RESOURCE  MANAGEMENT STRATEGY IN U.S.-BASED JAPANESE  SUBSIDIARIES: AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION  California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo  Allan Bird*  Schon Beechler**  Columbia University  Abstract. This study examines linkages between business strategy  and human resource management (HRM) strategy in Japanese  subsidiaries in the U.S. It investigates whether or not fit between a  subsidiary's business strategy and its HRM strategy is associated  with higher performance. The data show that subsidiaries with  matched strategies performed better than unmatched ones in terms  of HRM-related performance measures such as rates of promotion  and turnover. Japanese subsidiaries with a business strategy/HRM  strategy match were also more likely to experience better business  performance versus competitors than were unmatched ones.  INTRODUCTION  Japanese management practices have received considerable attention and notoriety  over the past fifteen years as Westerners have searched for the key to Japan's  meteoric economic success. This attention has shifted in the last few years from  what the Japanese are doing at home to what they are doing overseas. This atten-  tion is due, in part, to the increased level of overseas investment by Japanese firms.  Japanese transnational corporations (TNCs) have aggressively moved into a global  business  arena once  dominated by  European and American TNCs.

Today, Japanese TNCs represent a formidable international presence around  the world. Between  1988  and 1989 alone, total direct foreign investment by  Japanese firms increased from $47.02 billion to $67.54 billion, more than a five-  fold increase over the  1985 investment level  [JEI 1990]. By  the end of March,  1990,  cases  of  Japanese FDI had reached 57,400,  totaling $254  billion  [JEI  1990]. Japanese investment in the U.S. between FY 1951 and FY 1990 accounted  for 42% of all Japanese FDI, making the U.S.  the largest recipient of Japanese  FDI during the postwar period. In comparison, the U.K.,  the second highest  recipient of Japanese FDI during the same period, accounted for only 7.3% of  total Japanese FDI worldwide. New Japanese investment in the U.S.  increased  dramatically in the mid- 1980s and peaked in fiscal year 1989 at an annual total of  $32.54  billion  including  2,668  new  cases  of  investment.  Although  annual  Japanese investment in the United States declined 19.7% from the 1989 figure,  2,269 new cases, amounting to $26.1 billion in new Japanese investment flowed  into the United States in 1990.  Although the rapid and visible increase in Japanese foreign direct investment has  spawned a closer look at Japanese overseas operations, this attention is also due,  in no small part, to the perceived successes a number of visible Japanese firms  have had in management and production in their foreign operations. For example,  NUMMI, the Toyota-GM joint venture, has been the focus of attention for both  journalists and academicians (cf., Duerr [1991]).  Although most American managers, the business press, and the general public  believe that Japanese transnational corporations are well managed and that they  share common management characteristics because they are Japanese, there is  little empirical evidence to support these conclusions [DeNero 1990]. Relatively  little is known about the management of the foreign operations of Japanese TNCs  and much of what is known comes from the popular press and is primarily anec-  dotal in nature. With few exceptions, the empirical studies that do exist [Beechler  & Bird 1994; Kenney & Florida 1993; Pucik, Hanada & Fifield, 1989; Shibagaki,  Trevor & Abo  1989] are generally descriptive in nature with the result that little  progress has been made toward developing and applying discipline-based theo-  retical paradigms to Japanese TNCs.  One consequence of this empirical deficiency has been an assumption by some  researchers that Japanese management is culturally deterministic: Japanese com-  panies have instituted specific types of policies and practices both at home and  abroad simply because they are Japanese. Such an assumption overlooks the  potential influence of  distinctive competencies, industry effects, or other vari-  ables which  have been  shown to  be  elemental in determining organizational  structures and processes in research on American firms, both domestic and inter-  national (cf., Chandler [1962]; Bartlett & Ghoshal [1989]).  In this paper we focus on the relationship between business strategy and human  resource management [HRM] strategy and the impact that this relationship has on  performance in U.S.-based Japanese subsidiaries. We first describe a theoretical  LINKS BETWEEN BUSINESS & HRM STRATEGY  25  framework that incorporates recent thinking in strategy and international human  resource management and explicitly attempts to explain the relationships between  business-level  strategies and human resource management strategies and out-  comes. We then test this model in a study of business strategy-HRM linkages in  sixty-four U.S.-based Japanese subsidiaries.  This research serves several valuable functions. First, it provides an expanded  empirical platform for analyzing the actions of Japanese firms in the U.S.  The  behaviors of Japanese subsidiaries have a dynamic impact on the U.S. economy  and on how U.S. firms are managed. Numerous books and articles (cf., Lincoln  &  Kalleberg [1990];  Ouchi  [1981];  Pascale  & Athos  [1981];  Sethi,  Namiki  & Swanson  [1984];  Sullivan  [1992])  have detailed how Japanese managerial  practices -  many specifically related to human resources -  may or may not be  effective in the U.S.  While most of these posit a relationship between strategy  and HRM policies,  many are unclear as to the specific relationships and offer  little systematic data to support their contentions. This paper explicitly examines  the relationship between subsidiary business unit strategy and HRM strategy and  the link to HRM outcomes and firm performance.  A  second beneficial function served by this study is  the insight it provides re-  garding organizational activity in environments of  heightened uncertainty. The  prevailing theoretical assumptions underlying conceptual and empirical work on  the connections between HRM practices and business strategy are ones of contin-  gency [Baird & Meshoulam 1988; Lengnick-Hall & Lengnick-Hall 1988]. These  assumptions are twofold. First, it is assumed that the selection and mix of human  resource practices are determined by the specific strategy a firm adopts, which is  itself influenced by environmental constraints. Second, it is  assumed that firms  achieving a tighter fit between environmental constraints, strategy requirements,  and HRM actions will  perform better than those that do not. Achieving  a fit  between environment, strategy and HRM is  difficult for most business units  under normal circumstances. Under conditions of  increased diversity and un-  certainty, a situation encountered by TNCs, the challenge is even greater. Regu-  latory differences between home and host country, cultural differences between  the headquarters personnel and the host country labor force, and geographical  distance  from the parent company all  imbue the activities  of  environmental  scanning, strategy formulation, and policy implementation with substantial ambi-  guity. Achieving fit under such conditions is  likely to be simultaneously more  important and more difficult to accomplish.  In the next section we develop a theoretical framework of the linkages between  business strategy and HRM strategy. This framework is used to generate hypo-  theses that we then test with data from U.S.-based Japanese subsidiaries.  THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK  A  general model is  employed to conceptualize linkages between environment,  business  strategy, HRM strategy and performance. Business  strategy can be  thought of as a set of decisions about the direction of a firm. Firms select busi-  ness  strategies in accordance with evaluations they make about their distinctive  26  JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES, FIRST QUARTER 1995  competencies and the environment in which they wish to compete [Mintzberg  1990]. Implementation of a business strategy necessitates breaking it down into  smaller, manageable components. This process of decomposition occurs as the  various functional or divisional units within the organization develop responses  specific  to  their activities.  Functional units within an organization establish  underlying strategies which provide a foundation that helps to guide them in the  development and implementation of policy [Beechler, Bird & Raghuram 1993].  Although the model recognizes relationships between organization-level business  strategy and various functional strategies, the focus of this study is solely on the  human resource management function. In short, the interest is specifically in the  relationship between business strategy, HRM strategy, and performance.  While each firm tailors its particular business strategy to fit its unique distinctive  competencies, needs, and circumstances, it is useful to apply a simplifying frame-  work when developing theoretical constructs [Daft 1984; Dubin 1978]. Consistent  with previous studies in this area [Miles & Snow  1984; Olian & Rynes  1984;  Sonnenfeld & Peiperl 1988],  we  adopt Miles  and Snow's  [1984]  typology  of  Prospector, Defender and Analyzer strategies. We do so for two reasons. First,  extensive use of  this classificatory scheme in prior empirical efforts [Gupta &  Govindarajan  1986;  Hambrick  & Mason  1984;  Miles  & Snow  1978]  has  demonstrated its utility is explaining general strategic orientations at the business  level. Second, the typology appears to fit well with the strategic orientations of  subsidiaries. Foreign direct investment occurs for a variety of  reasons, but, in  general, three of the most commonly identified rationales are: 1) to develop new  markets; 2) to solidify current market positions; and 3) to simultaneously maintain  current market position, while expanding into new markets. These orientations  toward foreign direct investment are consistent with the Miles and Snow typology,  where the Prospector pursues market expansion and innovation, the Defender  strives to maintain market position, and the Analyzer seeks some combination of  market expansion/innovation while endeavoring to preserve stability in existing  markets.  Although they do not discuss HRM in detail, Miles and Snow [1984] identify  three pure types  of  strategies  and their key  human resource  implications.  Defenders create a secure market share with moderate, steady growth. To support  their strategy, Defenders rely heavily on internally developed human resources:  employees  are carefully  selected,  placed  and trained. In addition,  they are  expected to be with the company for much, if not all, of their careers.  The second strategy is the Prospector. Firms employing this type of strategy are  characterized by rapid growth and continual resource deployment/redeployment,  particularly of  management and technical personnel. To support this strategy,  human resource units perform an entrepreneurial role, helping to identify and  quickly develop crucial human resources through the rapid movement and altera-  tion of assignments. Key human resources are brought in from outside as well as  developed internally.  The  third strategic  type  identified  by  Miles  and Snow  is  the Analyzer.  In  Analyzers, management believes that the firm can compete not only in the early  LINKS BETWEEN BUSINESS & HRM STRATEGY  27  phase of product development when the emphasis in on uniqueness, but later on  as well,  when efficient mass production becomes necessary to be competitive.  For mature products and production processes, the human resource unit plays the  training and maintenance role appropriate to the Defender strategy by using ac-  curate placement and appraisal devices. For innovative developments, the human  resource unit plays  a more developmental role by designing  flexible  and en-  riching team structures and processes.  Drawing on the work of Miles and Snow, the model predicts that when a firm's  strategy is congruent with the external environment, firm performance will be  higher than when the business strategy is not. Consistency between a business  strategy and the external environment is only a first step, however. Consistency at  this interface does not directly influence firm performance. The second half of  the process of aligning a firm with the environment occurs in the implementation  of the strategy. It is the enactment of a business strategy, through the development  and application of  functional strategies within the various divisions  or units,  which also  determines firm performance [Hrebiniak & Joyce  1984].  In other  words, external fit is achieved, in part, as a consequence of internal fit.  Although the linkages in the model could be applied to any and all of the func-  tional areas within a firm, this study focuses solely on the HRM function. While  many classificatory schemes exist for typing HRM, we use one that reflects the  philosophical approach taken to manage human resources [Carroll 1991; Cascio  1991; Dyer  1984; Schuler 1988; Schuler & Jackson 1987b]. This approach is  consistent with previous theoretical and empirical writings regarding Japanese  and American business  practices [Hatvany & Pucik  1981; Kagono, Nonaka,  Sakakibara & Okumura 1985] and defines three kinds of HRM strategy [Carroll  1991; Cascio 1991; Schuler 1988]. A  Utilizer strategy is predicated on minimal  commitment and high skill utilization. It seeks to deploy the human resources of  a firm as efficiently as possible through: 1) acquiring and dismissing personnel  based on  short-term needs; and 2)  matching employee  skills  to  specific  task  requirements. An Accumulator strategy is based on maximum involvement and  skilled execution. It attempts to build up the human resources of the firm through:  1) the acquisition of  personnel with large, latent potential; and 2) the develop-  ment of that latent potential over time in a manner consistent with the needs of  the organization. Finally, a Facilitator strategy is  founded on generating new  knowledge and new knowledge creation. It seeks to develop the human resources  of the firm as effectively as possible through: 1) the acquisition of self-motivated  personnel; and 2)  the encouragement and support of  personnel to develop, on  their own,  the  skills  and knowledge  which  they, the employees,  believe  are  important.  To clarify the match of business strategy to HRM strategy, it is useful to consider  the organizational requirements that a selected business strategy may impose and  the proposed policy implications that a given HRM strategy might suggest. These  are presented in Table 1.  In the following  sections  we  consider the relationship between specific  com-  binations of business strategy and HRM strategy. We show how particular ideal  28  JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES, FIRST QUARTER 1995  TABLE 1  Relationship  between  Business  Strategy,  Organizational  Requirements,  and  HRM Strategy.

Defender Business Strategy/Accumulator HRM Strategy  Firms with a Defender strategy limit their search for new opportunities and,  instead, focus attention internally on ways to enhance organizational effective-  ness  [Miles  & Snow  1978].  Given  a narrow product market domain and an  orientation toward efficiency, organizational requirements gravitate in favor of  maintaining stability and focusing on internal operations. As a consequence, there  is  likely to be  limited environmental monitoring. Finally, central control, high  degrees of formalization, and elaborate control systems are hypothesized to pro-  mote organizational effectiveness [Miles & Snow 1978].  An Accumulator  HRM strategy, based  on  building  maximum involvement  and achieving skilled execution, serves Defender needs because it focuses  on  LINKS BETWEEN BUSINESS & HRM STRATEGY  29  providing skill development in an evolutionary fashion in accordance with the  firm's slowly evolving human resource needs. Its concern is on the acquisition of  employees  perceived to possess  large latent potential. Once latent potential is  acquired, the attention then shifts to developing ability, skill and knowledge in  ways that will serve company purposes.  The internal development of human resources over time requires the firm to exer-  cise  care in the selection of  new employees. The firm searches for both human  potential and personal fit and the relationship between employer and employee is  expected to be longterm. The result is an emphasis on job-security and the appli-  cation of  compensation and promotion policies  containing a  strong seniority  component. These, in turn, call for extensive training to develop potential which,  because it is directed at internal fit, is biased toward on-the-job training and the  development of a skill set that is firm-specific.  Analyzer Business Strategy/Facilitator HRM Strategy  Analyzers represent organizations that operate in relatively stable as well  as  changing product-market domains [Miles & Snow  1978]. Consequently, these  firms must identify and pursue new product-market opportunities while simulta-  neously maintaining a presence in existing domains. The pursuit of effectiveness  in both areas necessitates an ability to be efficient yet flexible in production tech-  nologies.  Accommodation of  both stable and dynamic areas of  operations re-  quires similar differentiation with regard to human resources.  A  Facilitator strategy fits  the organizational requirements of  Analyzer firms  because  it  accommodates the management of  dual pressures imposed by  an  Analyzer strategy. The pursuit of new markets requires an infusion of new skills  and talents into the firm, encouraging hiring from the external labor market.  Maintenance of existing product lines, by contrast, necessitates the internal devel-  opment of employees and encourages the development of an internal labor mar-  ket. Consequently, staffing policies will likely be a mix of both internal and exter-  nal selection. Firms with a Facilitator strategy may seek to offset the potential  schizophrenic  outcomes  of  a mixed  staffing  policy  by  carefully  recruiting  employees  with a desire for self-development. By  encouraging and supporting  self-development, a firm can focus its activities more fully on the accurate place-  ment of personnel and the design of flexible teams.  Prospector Business Strategy/Utilizer HRM Strategy  Prospector firms compete in broad product-market domains characterized by con-  tinual states of  flux. Constant product-market innovation reflects a response to  this dynamic domain, requiring the capacity to closely  monitor external events  [Miles & Snow 1978]. Additionally, the ability to develop new products and enter  new markets requires creativity and idea generation. Decentralized control sys-  tems and rapid deployment of  resources further characterize firms employing  Prospector strategies.  Given the  volatility  of  their environments, Prospector firms are expected  to  employ a Utilizer HRM strategy geared towards providing appropriate, readily  30  JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES, FIRST QUARTER 1995  available skills consistent with the companies' constantly changing needs. Such  an approach places minimal emphasis on employee commitment while trying to  achieve  high  skill  utilization. As  a consequence,  selection  policies  focus  on  closely  matching skills to immediate task requirements. The need for rapid de-  ployment of  resources in response to market development and innovation also  reduces emphasis on training. The view of employees as another resource of the  firm and the emphasis on resource utilization and deployment encourage the de-  velopment of appraisal and reward systems based on results [Kagono et al. 1985].  Additionally, compensation is likely to be referenced to the external market.  In terms of  the impact of  specific combinations of business strategy and HRM  strategy on organizational performance, Table 1 presents suggestions regarding  the appropriate match between each business strategy and HRM strategy type.  Miles and Snow [1978] have argued that their typology does not imply one best  business  strategy, any of  the three strategy types  can lead to high  firm per-  formance. Consequently, no distinction is made as to whether or not one particu-  lar ideal  match will  outperform another, rather it is  proposed that firms with  appropriate matches will outperform firms with mismatches.  Proposition 1: Firms with ideal matches between business strategy and  HRM strategy (i.e., Prospector- Utilizer, Defender-  Accumulator; and Analyzer-Facilitator) will perform  better than firms with mismatches.  HYPOTHESES  The  business  strategy/HRM  strategy match may  influence  subsidiary  per-  formance on several dimensions. Below  we  identify two aspects of  subsidiary  performance and propose specific hypotheses.  HRM-Related Outcome Measures  The contingency  model  indicates that business  strategy is  translated by each  functional unit into a local strategy that influences performance in that functional  area. While performance in each functional area, in turn, affects performance at  the firm level, it constitutes only one of several factors contributing to firm per-  formance. Consequently, in the case of this study, we anticipate that the strongest  effects  of  a business strategy/HRM strategy match will  be on outcomes most  closely tied to HRM activities.  In the context  of  subsidiary operations, four HRM-related outcomes  appear  important. These four include employee morale, tenure, promotion, and turnover.  Each is considered below.  Employee morale constitutes one outcome that is  likely to be influenced by the  business strategy/HRM strategy match. Previous research (cf., Tung [1981]) on  foreign subsidiary HRM activities has noted that cultural differences between  parent and subsidiary countries, the presence of parent-company managers, and  perceptions by host country employees of  a lack of control and autonomy fre-  quently contribute to a low level of  morale. A  proper combination of business  LINKS BETWEEN BUSINESS & HRM STRATEGY  31  strategy and HRM strategy should increase morale by helping to create in the  minds of subsidiary employees a sense of coherency and rationality in what the  subsidiary is trying to accomplish and how it is trying to accomplish it. Indeed,  Pucik et al.  [1989] note that one of  the most frequently cited sources of  local  national employee dissatisfaction within U.S.-based Japanese subsidiaries is not  knowing why things are done or how they fit into a bigger picture.  Hypothesis 1: Japanese subsidiaries with ideal matches between business  strategy and HRM strategy will experience higher levels of  employee morale than subsidiaries with mismatches.  One indication that a firm has effective HRM functions is its ability to retain and  promote employees. Firms that are able to match business strategy and HRM  strategies will be more likely to select people appropriate to the strategy they are  pursuing. Better selection and retention suggests higher levels of employee tenure  and lower levels of turnover. Moreover, selection of employees who match sub-  sidiary needs should also lead to an increased likelihood of promotion for such  employees.  Hypothesis 2: Japanese subsidiaries with ideal matches between business  strategy and HRM strategy will have higher levels of average  employee tenure than subsidiaries with mismatches.  Hypothesis 3: Japanese subsidiaries with ideal matches between business  strategy and HRM strategy will have higher rates of employ-  ee promotion than subsidiaries with mismatches.  Hypothesis 4: Japanese subsidiaries with ideal matches between business  strategy and HRM strategy will experience lower rates of  employee turnover than subsidiaries with mismatches.  Firm Performance Measures  The business strategy-HRM strategy match may affect different aspects of perfor-  mance at the firm level. As  we previously noted, however, firm performance is  influenced by a broad array of  factors. It is  also probable that some aspects of  firm performance may be more strongly affected by specific factors. By decom-  posing firm performance into several variables we should be better able to get at  the issue of which performance factors may be most influenced by the business  strategy-HRM strategy match.  Subsidiary profit and sales growth are two financial measures frequently used in  evaluating  company performance. Companies,  including  foreign  subsidiary  operations, with business strategy/HRM strategy matches should manage their  resources more efficiently and effectively, thereby reducing their operating costs.  Moreover, firms with ideal matches should be more effective in aligning human  resources to their overall strategic thrusts, thereby responding more appropriately  to environmental constraints and opportunities. Fit between business strategy and  HRM strategy is  therefore predicted to lead to increased subsidiary sales and  greater profits.  32  JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES, FIRST QUARTER 1995  Hypothesis 5: Japanese subsidiaries with ideal matches between business  strategy and HRM strategy will achieve higher profits than  subsidiaries with mismatches.  Hypothesis 6: Japanese subsidiaries with ideal matches between business  strategy and HRM strategy will experience higher sales  growth than subsidiaries with mismatches.  It should also be recognized, however, that subsidiaries do not always act with  complete autonomy. Sometimes they pursue goals mandated by the parent or-  ganization that are not directly related to financial objectives. For example, a parent  firm may establish goals for its subsidiary, such as developing new products or  improving product quality, which do not lead to enhanced profit or sales for that  subsidiary in the short term, but which benefit the larger organization. Parent com-  pany objectives for the subsidiary should enhance the strategic focus of managers  in the subsidiary and, to the extent that subsidiary managers in turn align the sub-  sidiary's HRM strategy with these objectives, the subsidiary should do better in  reaching them.  Hypothesis 7: Japanese subsidiaries with ideal matches between business  strategy and HRM strategy will experience higher levels of  performance on parent-prescribed objectives than sub-  sidiaries with mismatches.  A second way of looking at firm performance is in more general terms. Because  its activities are directed at people throughout an organization, HRM is purported  to have wide-ranging effects within the organization. Rather than thinking of per-  formance in terms of specific outcomes, it may be useful to think of it as having  overarching impact. If HRM activities do have wide-ranging effects, then firms  with a good  match between strategy and HRM ought to do better overall than  mismatched firms.  Hypothesis 8: Japanese subsidiaries with ideal matches between business  strategy and HRM strategy will achieve higher overall per-  formance than subsidiaries with mismatches.  A  second generalized approach to conceptualizing subsidiary performance is to  evaluate how an organization is  doing relative to its competitors. While firms  with matches may not outperform their rivals when those rivals also have ideal  matches, we  would expect firms with mismatched strategies to perform more  poorly than their competitors.  Hypothesis 9: Japanese subsidiaries with ideal matches between business  strategy and HRM strategy will perform better relative to  their competitors than will subsidiaries with mismatches.  METHODOLOGY  Sample  A  questionnaire survey of non-randomly selected senior personnel managers in  U.S. subsidiaries of Japanese firms was carried out between November 1990 and  LINKS BETWEEN BUSINESS & HRM STRATEGY  33  February  1991.  Questionnaires  were  mailed  to  219  of  approximately  400  Japanese-owned companies in the United States that had expressed interest in  HRM issues in an earlier KPMG Peat Marwick study of labor practices. Roughly  equal numbers of manufacturing and service firms with 100 employees or more  were selected for inclusion in our study. After partitioning, the sample was divided  along two strata: 1) manufacturing and non-manufacturing firms; 2)  geographic  distribution across the United States, with equal numbers of manufacturing and  non-manufacturing firms drawn from the East Coast, West Coast, and Midwest  regions of the U.S.  The expressed interest of these firms in HRM-related issues raises the question of  whether or not they are representative of the larger population of Japanese sub-  sidiaries in the U.S.  To the extent that an expressed emphasis on HRM issues  may predispose firms to align their business and HRM strategies, the differences  between matched and unmatched firms in this sample would be lessened, making  our test of hypotheses a conservative one.  Sixty-four of  the 219 firms returned usable surveys, for a response rate of 29%.  This return rate is  roughly comparable to other studies with similar objectives  [Hitt, Ireland & Palia 1982; Dean & Snell  1991]. An analysis of  basic charac-  teristics of respondent and non-respondent firms in terms of type [manufacturing  vs.  non-manufacturing], geographic location,  and company size  revealed no  significant differences. The 64  firms included 33  manufacturing and 31  non-  manufacturing firms. A profile of basic firm characteristics is presented in Table 2.

However, for  forty-one  companies  we  received  a completed  questionnaire  from only  the  34  JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES, FIRST QUARTER 1995  American manager. For the remaining twenty-three, we received responses from  both the Japanese and American managers. To test for possible  differences in  responses due to nationality for these twenty-three firms we conducted an analy-  sis to test for interrater agreement using the procedure followed by Shortell and  Zajac [1990] and by Kotha, Dunbar and Bird [forthcoming]. As  82% [228/276]  of the responses on self-report items were either identical or within one interval  of  one another, we  concluded that a satisfactory degree of  interrater reliability  existed. In the interest of  consistency across observations, only the American  responses were retained.  Strategy Measures  Business Strategy. A modified version of Miles and Snow's [Hrebiniak & Joyce  1984]  typology  including Prospectors, Defenders and Analyzers was used to  measure respondents' business strategy and classify  them into nominal cate-  gories. HRM managers read brief descriptions of strategy types and were asked  to identify the one that most closely resembled their firm's strategy. Self-typing  using nominal scales for the measurement of Miles  and Snow strategic arche-  types is both a common and accepted methodology [McDaniel & Kolari 1987;  McKee, Varadarajan & Pride 1989; Segev 1987a, 1987b; Shortell & Zajac 1990;  Snow & Hrebiniak 1980].  HRM Strategy. Respondents' HRM strategies were identified in a fashion similar  to that used to  measure business strategy. After reading general descriptions of  HRM strategy types  [Schuler  1988],  respondents indicated which  one  most  closely  resembled the HRM strategy employed at their firm. The result was a  nominal variable with three categories.  HRM Outcome Measures  In the case  of  outcomes directly related to HRM practices, it was possible to  obtain objective,  quantitative data on  all but one  of  the variables. Employee  Morale, the extent to which employees, in the firm as a whole, exhibit a positive  affect toward their work, was measured using a five-point scale ranging from  " very low" to "very high."  Although evaluation of employee morale may be considered an inherently sub-  jective task, the respondents-human resource managers-are charged with making  such assessments as a function of their job and are experienced at doing so. In  this respect, though a subjective evaluation, the measurement of employee morale  used in this study is made by individuals who may be considered experts at doing  so. Having only a single measure of employee morale is problematic and would  be a critical issue if our concern was with the level of  employee morale. How-  ever, our interest is  in the difference in level between matched and unmatched  firms. Because there is no obvious reason for HRM managers in matched firms to  assess employee morale more highly than HRM managers in unmatched firms it  was felt that a single-item measure was acceptable.  Average length of tenure is a measure of the effectiveness of HRM policies be-  cause it reflects a subsidiary's ability to attract and retain appropriate employees.  LINKS BETWEEN BUSINESS & HRM STRATEGY  35  This variable was calculated by taking the average length of tenure of all manage-  rial-class U.S. employees in the subsidiary.  A  third outcome  of  effective  HRM activities  is  increased  opportunities for  individual growth and career advancement. Annual rates of promotion for  top  managers  and promotion for  all  other  managers  were  used  to  provide two  measures of this variable. Promotions were measured as the average percentage  of managers receiving promotions annually.  A  final measure of  an effective  business  strategy/HRM-strategy match is  the  extent to which firms can avoid unnecessary quits or layoffs. While it is true that  employee exits can constitute a positive outcome for both an organization and an  employee under some circumstances, in a more general sense turnover represents  at the very least the presence of  inadequacies in  selection  practices or HRM  planning. As with promotions, turnover was measured for both top managers and  all other managerial class employees, and was calculated as the average annual  turnover rate for each group.  Subsidiary Performance Measures  Because Japanese companies are quite sensitive about publicly reporting finan-  cial data, we  were compelled to use  less  intrusive self-reported measures. This  approach was also necessary because a majority of the firms sampled are wholly-  owned subsidiaries and, consequently, are not required to divulge such informa-  tion to regulatory agencies or make it public in other ways. While self-report data  may be  subject to  response bias  in  some  circumstances, Dess  and Robinson  [1984] suggest that, in the absence of objective data, self-report measures consti-  tute an acceptable substitute and are often equally reliable.  On a five-point scale ranging from "very low level of performance" to "very high  level of  performance," managers were asked to indicate the level of  their sub-  sidiary's performance with regard to specific outcomes. These included subsidiary  profit and subsidiary sales volume. Additionally, each manager identified the parent  organization's most important criterion for evaluating the success  of  the sub-  sidiary's operations-parent-prescribed objective-and,  using the same scale  as  above, rated their firm's performance on that criterion for 1989.  In addition to these outcome-specific measures, respondents also rated their sub-  sidiary's overall performance and its performance relative to major competitors  in the U.S. These ratings were also measured on a five-point Likert-type scale.  The means, standard deviations, and correlations for the HRM and subsidiary  performance variables are presented in Table 3.  Analysis  The analytical methods used  in this study were chi-square and t-tests of  dif-  ferences between  means. These  are appropriate techniques, given the size  of  the  sample and the nature of  the hypotheses  to  be  tested. Analyses  focused  on identifying and testing for the presence of  fit between business strategy and  HRM strategy, followed by an investigation into the relationship between busi-  ness strategylHRM strategy match and performance.  36  JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES, FIRST QUARTER 1995  0 c  00  Q co  8  to2  C  0  OOC\J  CM N  000  a  0)  LO  n  n  M  0  o  o  T  0  m  cLO  L0N0Nf-CO.JCO  LO  COQD  Ov-  0.~D  C  1- 'JCt~  0  ) tJ  0  0  o  co  .0  oo  0.  0  0  L)  0  o  N-  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .

Table 4 reveals that only ten of the sixty-four firms employed a Prospector busi-  ness  strategy. The remaining fifty-four subsidiaries adopted either Analyzer or  Defender business strategies, suggesting a generally conservative approach to  product and market innovations among the Japanese subsidiaries in our sample.

In terms of managing their human resources, ten firms used a Utilizer strategy.  The remaining fifty-four employed either an Accumulator or Facilitator strategy,  indicating an orientation toward long-term investment in human resources.  Results of the chi-square test of the business strategy/HRM strategy matches are  also  shown in Table 4.  Overall, thirty of  the sixty-four subsidiaries had com-  binations hypothesized as ideal. In summary, the findings indicate that thirty of  sixty-four firms, or 47%, have business strategy/HRM strategy matches, which  we  have proposed will  lead to higher performance. Moreover, Japanese sub-  sidiaries in the U.S. appear to rely on conservative business strategies and HRM  strategies emphasizing a long-term orientation toward human resources. These  findings are consistent with those of  prior empirical investigations into the be-  havior of Japanese firms domestically within Japan [Kagono et al. 1985].  In the second phase of the analysis, firms were divided into two sets, those with  matched strategies and those with unmatched ones. Differences in means tests  were then conducted on  the  six  HRM-related performance measures. These  results are presented in Table 5.  Among the HRM-related outcome measures, the findings are mixed, although  generally supportive of  the hypotheses. The results, shown in Table 5,  support  Hypothesis 1: matched firms experienced significantly higher levels of employee  morale than did unmatched firms. Also,  the prediction that subsidiaries with  hypothesized matches will experience significantly longer employee tenure than  unmatched firms (Hypothesis 2), is strongly supported. Employees in subsidiaries  that conformed to proposed ideal matches between business strategy and HRM  strategy experienced significantly longer tenures than employees in firms that  were unmatched. Results pertaining to our third hypothesis, that managers in  38  JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES, FIRST QUARTER 1995  matched firms would experience higher levels  of  promotion, were in the pre-  dicted direction but not statistically significant. Finally, strong support was found  for Hypothesis 4: subsidiaries with matched strategies experienced substantially  lower rates of turnover than their unmatched counterparts.

Table 5 also presents the  results for the t-tests of differences between means for matched and unmatched  firms on firm performance. Hypothesis 5 was not supported by the findings. In  fact, unmatched subsidiaries report slightly better performance on profit than  matched ones.  Results for Hypotheses 6 through 8 are in the predicted direction, but not statisti-  cally  significant. The one  subsidiary performance measure where firms with  matched strategies did outperform unmatched ones at a significant level was in  performance versus rivals. Thus, the results of the analysis support Hypothesis 9.  In the case of  Hypothesis 6,  which stated that matched firms would experience  higher sales growth than unmatched firms, there arose a question as to whether  the  weak findings  might not reflect  the possibility  that growth was  directly  LINKS BETWEEN BUSINESS & HRM STRATEGY  39  influenced by the business strategy, the logic being that Prospectors might possi-  bly experience higher levels of growth than Analyzers or Defenders. This is a dis-  tinct possibility. However, adoption of a Defender strategy does not necessarily  mean that a firm will not pursue growth. One way of maintaining market posi-  tion is by keeping up with or outpacing the growth of one's competitors. The dis-  tinctive differences between Prospectors and Defenders, while perhaps involving  some  variance with  regard to  an emphasis  on growth, revolve  more around  product and market innovation. Defenders seek growth through defense of posi-  tion within an existing product domain, whereas Prospectors seek growth through  the development of new products or new product domains.  One way to test for the possible confounding effects of comparing matched ver-  sus unmatched firms across different strategy types would be to conduct a within-  type analysis. Unfortunately, the small sample size,  particularly in the case of  Prospectors, negated the possibility of doing this effectively. However, post hoc  within-type comparative assessments appeared to confirm our findings from the  pooled analysis.  The  absence  of,  or weak  support for, the  hypotheses  linking  HRM strategy  match with subsidiary performance may be attributable to the contributing in-  fluence of other factors outside the HRM function. We therefore examined other  characteristics of  matched and unmatched firms to  determine if  moderating  factors influencing performance were present. Though not shown here, tests of  the influence of parent and subsidiary size, subsidiary age, level of capitalization,  initial mode of entry, and type of  industry were carried out. Neither size of the  parent nor subsidiary, nor age of the parent or subsidiary, nor type of industry -  manufacturing or service -  were found to differ significantly between matched  and unmatched firms.  We also explored the possibility that some of  the findings might be due to the  influence of  either business strategy or HRM strategy alone as opposed to the  match between the two. To do this we  recalibrated the two  strategy variables  using ordinal measures in place of the original categorical measures to generate  Spearman rank correlations with the performance outcome measures. In the case  of business strategy, the Miles and Snow archetypes were rank ordered in terms  of  the  degree  to  which  they  favor  product/market  innovativeness,  with  Prospectors being  greatest, then Analyzers,  and Defenders being  least.  This  characterization is consistent with Miles and Snow's [1978] original presentation  of the typology and with its subsequent interpretation and use [Hambrick 1983].  Similar treatment was applied to the Schuler typology of  HRM strategies. The  primary dimension  along  which  the  three types  can be  differentiated is  the  emphasis on,  and investment in,  training and development [Beechler & Bird  1994]  with Accumulators investing  and emphasizing training the most,  then  Facilitators, and Utilizers emphasizing and investing the least. The results of the  Spearman rank correlation analysis of  business strategy, HRM strategy and the  performance outcome measures is reported in Table 6.  Hypothesis 3 held that subsidiaries with an ideal match would have higher rates  of  employee  promotion. It is  conceivable  that business  strategy alone might  40  JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES, FIRST QUARTER 1995  explain differences between matched and unmatched firms in terms of  rates of  promotion, with the expectation being that promotions might be more prevalent  in Prospectors as opposed to Defenders. However, a consideration of the results  in Table 6 reveals that the relationship between the two variables is statistically  insignificant. In a similar vein, because the Utilizer HRM strategy focuses on the  efficient  deployment of  personnel, there was  some concern that the findings  favoring Hypothesis 4 might derive from a direct influence between turnover and  HRM strategy. Table 6 indicates that this is not the case. Indeed, neither business  strategy nor HRM strategy had a statistically significant relationship to the HRM  or firm performance variables. This post hoc  analysis further strengthens the  argument that it is the match between the two strategies that is important.

The findings offer firm, but guarded support for  this proposition. Subsidiaries with matched combinations did outperform their  unmatched counterparts, particularly with regard to  HRM-related outcomes.  Matching business strategy to HRM strategy is  associated with superior HRM  outcomes. However, there appears to be less  impact on organization-level sub-  sidiary performance. Consequently, the extent to which the business strategy-  HRM strategy linkage  matters to  organizational-level  performance requires  further investigation.  Beyond findings of  statistical significance and support for several hypotheses,  this study raises a number of other points that warrant discussion. Of particular  interest are the findings regarding the prevalence of particular business strategies  and HRM strategies among our sample firms. In terms of business strategy, fifty-  four of the sixty-four firms were either Defenders or Analyzers. This distribution  seems consistent with previous empirical work on Japanese firms that suggests  they are more inclined  to  respond in  an incremental and reactive fashion to  changes in their external environment [Kagono, Nonaka, Sakakibara & Okumura  1985].  LINKS BETWEEN BUSINESS & HRM STRATEGY  41  This conservative tendency may be heightened in U.S.-based subsidiaries as a  consequence  of  Japanese MNCs'  inexperience  in managing operations in  a  foreign context. The average subsidiary in the sample was only ten years old,  suggesting that many are still at the steep end of the learning curve. Follow-up  interviews by the authors with a number of HRM managers in the participating  companies confirmed this interpretation. Several managers noted that not only  was the subsidiary young, but that it also represented the parent company's first  major operation outside of Japan. As  a result, the parent firm was moving for-  ward conservatively and making changes very slowly. One manager noted that  his firm spent four years preparing for the opening of  its U.S.  manufacturing  facility. This was in addition to three years spent in considering whether or not to  establish a U.S. operation.  Firms were  also  bunched in terms of  HRM strategies,  with  fifty-four  firms  adopting either Accumulator or Facilitator strategies. Interviews with HRM man-  agers suggest that this bifurcation was largely the result of the HRM manager's  personal orientation. Firms more frequently adopted Accumulator strategies when  they hired managers sympathetic to a Japanese management approach and en-  couraged those managers to apply parent company values.  The influence of  the HRM manager was not the only, or necessarily the most,  important factor in determining HRM strategy. Differences  in HRM strategy  appear to reflect underlying company orientations to adaptation. Firms pursuing  an Accumulator approach relied heavily on a more traditional Japanese approach  to managing subsidiary employees, attempting to transplant many of the practices  that they used in Japan. For example, one subsidiary went so far as to translate  the parent company's employee  handbook into English and then modified it  where necessary to comply with U.S. labor laws.  In contrast, firms employing a Facilitator strategy sought adaptation through the  interpretation of basic parent company norms and values provided by a U.S. man-  ager familiar with the local environment. Facilitators sought the middle ground  between traditional Japanese and traditional American approaches to managing  the HRM function.  Nevertheless,  the underlying foundation appeared to  be  strongly tilted toward that of the parent company's HRM strategy.  Although in our sample there were only a small number of  Utilizers, an HRM  strategy most frequently associated with American firms, these companies dis-  played several distinctive characteristics. Subsidiaries with Utilizer strategies  hired experienced  U.S.  human resources  managers and granted them near-  autonomy. They sought adaptation through the absorption of  local norms and  practices into the organization. Human resource managers we  interviewed in  Utilizers saw their role as one of educating the parent company.  One particularly striking aspect of the distribution of HRM strategies is the rela-  tively  large number of  firms opting for a Facilitator approach. Japanese firms  have often been portrayed as resource accumulators [Kagono et al. 1985], partic-  ularly with regard to HRM activities. Researchers have characterized them as  focused  on acquiring employees  possessing  large reserves of  latent potential  which can be developed and tailored to organization needs over time. While some  42  JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES, FIRST QUARTER 1995  writers [Abegglen 1956; Clark 1979; Dore  1973; Rohlen 1974] point out that  Japanese organizations are effective in achieving congruence between individual  interests and organizational goals, the tendency has been to characterize this fit in  terms of  how employee skills and abilities are shaped to match organizational  needs. References to Japanese practices aimed at developing human resource  potential that take into consideration individual preferences and aspirations are  rare. For Japanese subsidiaries in the U.S.,  it may be that the mix of  Japanese  organizational values and U.S. sociocultural orientations encourages a more indi-  vidual-centered approach in the selection of a HRM strategy. The result may be  the adoption of a Facilitator approach that allows for greater individual participa-  tion in the determination of what and how human resources are to be developed.  Considered in the larger context of theories regarding foreign subsidiary perfor-  mance, the findings of  this study point to a number of  important implications.  First, though much of  the work on subsidiary performance has focused on the  need to align the firm with environmental constraints, the importance of internal  fit deserves much more attention. Having found that internal fit with regard to the  business strategy-HRM strategy match affects performance, there is every reason  to assume that similar influences are exerted by matches between business strate-  gy and other functional areas of the subsidiary. To our knowledge this is a line of  inquiry that has remained largely unexplored.  This would also seem to suggest that our theories need to be more holistic. The  rather lackluster results regarding the impact of  the business-HRM strategy  match on firm performance point to a need to consider the subsidiary's internal  fit as a whole.  Given a strong presumption that HRM activities have a deep  impact on how a firm performs, the approach taken in this study may be some-  what simplistic. Rather than assuming that the business-HRM strategy match  influences only HRM performance and firm performance, it is more reasonable  to assume that this match also influences performance in other functional areas.  Indeed, mismatches between business strategy and HRM strategy may lead to  lowered firm performance indirectly through lowered performance in production,  sales and R&D.  The findings of  this investigation also have implications for practitioners. Our  interviews with HRM managers participating in this study suggest that, at least in  the case of Japanese subsidiaries in the U.S., little thought has been given to the  need to align business strategy and HRM strategy. In essence, managers at the  firms in our sample had not yet developed a view of HRM as a strategic activity  and, consequently, did not see a need to align their HRM strategy with the sub-  sidiary's business strategy. Yet it is clear that doing so yields benefits in terms of  lower turnover rates, longer employee tenure, as well  as higher levels  of  em-  ployee morale. The costs associated with turnover and new employee selection  and training ought to encourage HRM managers to focus more attention on the  business-HRM strategy match.  Several limitations of this study should be noted. One limitation of this study is  that the companies  were  not  chosen  randomly from the total population of  Japanese subsidiaries operating in the United States, but instead represent a large  LINKS BETWEEN BUSINESS & HRM STRATEGY  43  subset of  companies that had previously identified themselves as being particu-  larly interested in HRM issues. Therefore, generalization of this study's findings  cannot be made to the total population of Japanese firms operating in the U.S.  Despite significant findings for four of  the nine hypotheses, the failure to find  stronger support for the impact of  the business strategy/HRM strategy linkage  appears to be the result of the weak effect of this variable on organization-level  performance measures. Though an argument can be made that the power of the  statistical analyses was low, ultimately the issue is one of effect size. Given the  other factors that affect organization-level performance, the limited strength of  the linkage relationship may not be too surprising. Nevertheless, a relationship  does appear to exist.  Future research should move forward in several directions. First, the findings of  this  study  demonstrate  the  influence  of  internal  fit  on  firm  performance.  However, little is known about how easy it may be to achieve internal fit, particu-  larly with regard to HRM practices. Beechler, Bird and Raghuram [1993] note  that the importance of  internal fit may be moderated by  several key considera-  tions. The particular strategic orientation of  the parent firm and the nature of  international competition in which it is involved place differing levels of pressure  on  a TNC to  maintain policies  that are consistent  across countries and sub-  sidiaries. They note, for example, that TNCs with a strategic orientation centered  on cost leadership in industries characterized by global competition will face sub-  stantially greater pressure to maintain consistency between parent and subsidiary  policies than will TNCs with a strategic orientation based on product differentia-  tion in  industries where competition is  multidomestic. This suggests  that the  ability and need to achieve internal fit may be moderated by the parent's strategic  orientation in combination. In other words, some foreign subsidiaries may find it  more  difficult  than  others  to  match  business  strategy  and  HRM  strategy.  Additionally, the costs  involved in failing to achieve a business strategy-HRM  strategy match may be larger for some foreign subsidiaries than others. This is an  area where further theoretical and empirical work is sorely needed.  A  second  line  of  inquiry should focus  on the process  by  which  subsidiaries  achieve internal fit between business strategy and HRM strategy. There is  an  absence of descriptive evidence regarding how foreign subsidiaries develop HRM  strategy or align an existing one with business strategy. Calling for a matching up  of  HRM and business strategies without an understanding of  how to go  about  doing so  would be  imprudent. For this reason we  strongly suggest that future  investigations focus on how foreign subsidiaries go about aligning business and  HRM strategies.  CONCLUSION  This study examined linkages between business strategy and HRM practices in  Japanese subsidiaries in the U.S. It specifically investigated whether or not fit be-  tween a subsidiary's business strategy and its HRM strategy were associated with  higher performance. Subsidiaries with matched strategies did perform better on  HRM-related outcome measures than those that were unmatched. The relationship  44  JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES, FIRST QUARTER 1995  between HRM outcomes and firm performance, however, was less clear. Having  established a relationship between business strategy/HRM strategy match and  some aspects of performance, future research should explore the mechanisms by  which this match affects HRM policy formulation and implementation in over-  seas subsidiaries.
