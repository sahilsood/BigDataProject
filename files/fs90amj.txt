REPUTATION BUILDING  AND CORPORATE STRATEGY  CHARLES FOMBRUN  New York University  MARK SHANLEY  University of Chicago  Firms compete for reputational status in institutional fields. Managers  attempt to influence other stakeholders' assessments by signaling firms'  salient advantages. Stakeholders gauge firms' relative merits by inter-  preting ambiguous informational signals from the firms, the media, and  other monitors. The results of an empirical study of 292 large U.S. firms  supported the general hypothesis that publics construct reputations on  the basis of information about firms' relative structural positions within  organizational fields, specifically using market and accounting signals  indicating performance, institutional signals indicating conformity to  social norms, and strategy signals indicating strategic postures. Under-  standing the informational medium from which publics construct rep-  utations helps explain sources of mobility barriers within industries  that originate in external perceptions.  Corporate audiences routinely rely on the reputations of firms in making  investment decisions, career decisions, and product choices (Dowling,  1986). Reputations signal publics about how a firm's products, jobs, strate-  gies, and prospects compare to those of competing firms. Favorable reputa-  tions can therefore generate excess returns for firms by inhibiting the mo-  bility of rivals in an industry (Caves & Porter, 1977; Wilson, 1985).  Reputations may have other potentially favorable consequences. By sig-  naling consumers about product quality, favorable reputations may enable  firms to charge premium prices (Klein & Leffler, 1981; Milgrom & Roberts,  1986b), attract better applicants (Stigler, 1962), enhance their access to cap-  ital markets (Beatty & Ritter, 1986), and attract investors (Milgrom & Roberts,  1986a). Ultimately, reputational orderings crystallize the statuses of firms  within an industrial social system (Shrum & Wuthnow, 1988) and thereby  constitute an important venue for reconciling economic and sociological  contributions to the study of industrial stratification (Fombrun, 1986).  We have greatly benefited from the encouragement and helpful suggestions of colleagues,  especially Wayne Baker, Jane Dutton, Mark Mizruchi, Stefan Wally, and this journal's anony-  mous reviewers.

In a study of the Fortune 500, McGuire,  Sundgren, and Schneeweis (1988) found that prior return on assets was  highly correlated with a firm's reputation for social responsibility, which  suggests that economic performance serves an important signaling function  when publics construct reputational rankings of firms.  Yet economic performance is not the only basis on which to assess  firms. Firms serve multiple stakeholders, each of which applies distinct  criteria in evaluating corporate performance (Freeman, 1984). A theoretical  articulation of reputation as a construct should therefore anticipate the mul-  tiple economic and noneconomic criteria different constituents are likely to  apply in assessing firms.  This article interprets reputations as the outcome of a competitive pro-  cess in which firms signal their key characteristics to constituents to maxi-  mize their social status (Spence, 1974). Because of informational asymme-  tries in the market for reputational status, each of a firm's multiple publics  selectively attends to different informational cues, or signals, in judging its  effectiveness. Following Spence, we defined signals as "alterable observable  attributes" (1974: 107).  Although many signals broadcast to constituents are under firms' con-  trol, others emanate from external monitors. We therefore proposed specific  hypotheses relating assessments of reputation to various informational sig-  nals emanating from firms and their audiences: market and accounting sig-  nals representing corporate performance, institutional signals depicting  firms as more or less visible, attractive, and socially responsive, and strategy  signals defining firms' corporate postures. We tested this model of reputa-  tion building with data from a set of Fortune 500 firms.  REPUTATION BUILDING: INTERPRETING AMBIGUOUS SIGNALS  Just as firms compete for customers, so also do they vie for reputational  status. Publics construct reputations from available information about firms'  activities originating from the firms themselves, from the media, or from  other monitors. Publics use and propagate information they deem important  for assessing firms' successes and failures at acquiring resource inputs, im-  proving throughputs, and sustaining outputs. As signals about firms' activ-  ities, achievements, and prospects diffuse, individual interpretations aggre-  gate into collective judgments that crystallize into reputational orderings of  firms in organizational fields (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). Established repu-  tations themselves are signals that also influence the actions of firms' stake-  holders.  Reputational rankings constitute a potentially significant and under-  studied form of normative control that channels firms' actions by conferring  relative competitive advantage and disadvantage upon conforming organi-  zations within an organizational field (Shapiro, 1987; Shrum & Wuthnow, This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:41:52 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1990  Fombrun and Shanley  235  1988). If firms value their reputations, the desire to protect them can inhibit  them and their managers from engaging in activities constituents deem un-  acceptable. Established reputations may, therefore, impede managers' stra-  tegic responses to environmental events and are thus a distinct source of  intraindustry structure (Caves & Porter, 1977).  Fombrun and Zajac (1987), for instance, demonstrated how top manag-  ers' perceptions of environments induced different patterns of intraindustry  stratification-and hence of rivalry-than predictions based on purely  structural variables suggested. If reputational rankings are widely publicized  (as, say, Fortune's have become), they may alter managers' perceptions of  environmental threats and opportunities and of their firms' strengths and  weaknesses (Dutton & Jackson, 1987) and so influence the mobility barriers  that managers enact: Well-reputed firms have a competitive advantage  within their industries, but poorly reputed firms are disadvantaged. As Wil-  son pointed out, "the essential requirement for a player's reputation to mat-  ter for his current choice of action is his anticipation that his later decisions  will be conditioned by his later reputation" (1985: 27).  Since different publics attend to different features of firms' perfor-  mance, reputations reflect firms' relative success in fulfilling the expecta-  tions of multiple stakeholders (Freeman, 1984). The more informational  asymmetry and ambiguity characterize the interactions between managers  and stakeholders, the more likely the latter are to search for information  (Shrum & Wuthnow, 1988).  With homogeneous evaluators and informational symmetry between  managers and constituents, reputations would be irrelevant and epiphenom-  enal. Figure 1 presents a model of reputation building under the more real-  istic conditions of incomplete and ambiguous information and heteroge-  neous publics. The figure suggests that reputations represent publics' cumu-  lative judgments of firms over time. By showing how previous evaluators  have resolved ambivalence in firms' performance, reputations inform pub-  lics about current ambivalence and influence firms' actions. As Wilson  wrote about reputation building among individuals,  Differences in the information available to participants make  their strategies acutely sensitive to their beliefs and expecta-  tions. This in turn affects the behavior not only of the unin-  formed person, but also of the informed one, who realizes that  his current actions affect others' later beliefs, their expectations  about his subsequent behavior, and ultimately their choice of  actions. Knowing that this chain of events will occur, the in-  formed person has an incentive to trade off the immediate con-  sequences of his current decision against the long-term effects of  his reputation (1985: 59).  Although in this study we only addressed the determinants of reputa-  tion, reputational consequences are also worthy of considerable attention in  future research.

Such an investigation would require a strong theoretical model  capable of recognizing the simultaneous contributions to subsequent profit-  ability of both a firm's prior reputation and its entire performance history  and including other industry- and firm-level variables and evaluative crite-  ria with varying time lags. Lacking such a model, McGuire, Sundgren, and  Schneeweis (1988) may have concluded prematurely that a reputation for This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:41:52 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1990  Fombrun and Shanley  237  social responsibility had little effect on various measures of performance.1  Nonetheless, we agree with those researchers that in the short run, "it may  be more fruitful to consider financial performance as a variable influencing  ... [reputation] than the reverse" (1988: 869).  This study investigated hypotheses derived from the notion that firms  compete for reputation in a market characterized by incomplete information.  In framing hypotheses, we followed the outline of Figure 1 and assumed that  corporate audiences attend to market, accounting, institutional, and strategy  signals about firms.  Market Signals  Market signals present information to constituents about firms' current  activities, results, and prospects. External analysts, creditors, and investors  are particularly attuned to the market performance of firms and routinely  incorporate such data in their trading decisions (Fama, 1970). Through in-  formal networks and formal reports, their assessments of firms' prospects  diffuse through capital markets and contribute information to other publics'  judgments (Shrum & Wuthnow, 1988).  Market performance and market risk. High performance and low risk  predispose constituents to assess firms and their managers favorably. Klein  and Leffler (1981) proposed a model explaining the price premiums firms  obtain for high-quality products in terms of requiring investments in non-  salvageable assets like advertising and charitable contributions to maintain  consumer purchases, particularly in the case of products whose merits are  not verifiable prior to purchase. Just as prices signal product quality to  consumers, high economic performance signals a firm's inherent quality to  investors and creditors.2 Firms that report high performance and low risk  1 The high correlation (.41) McGuire and colleagues (1988) reported between 1982 reputa-  tion for social responsibility and average ROA for 1982-84 is deceiving. Not only does such a  bivariate analysis fail to control for multiple firm- and industry-level influences on ROA, it also  glosses over the joint influence of a firm's performance history on both reputation and values of  ROA. A better estimate is obtained by correlating the residuals obtained from two regressions of  (1) ROAt_2 and ROAt_1 on ROAt and (2) ROAt_2 and ROAt_1 on reputationt_1. We ran these  analyses for three years of data and obtained the following.  Simple Correlations  Variables Correlations of Residuals  1982 reputation x ROA, 1983 .45*** .09  1982 reputation x ROA, 1984 .41*** .07  1982 reputation x ROA, 1985 .26*** -.03  *** p < .001  The nonsignificant correlations between the residual scores indicate that a stronger model is  required to investigate the implications of reputation for subsequent performance.  2 The analogy may appear somewhat stretched since firms do not as a rule select perfor-  mance levels. However, managers are known to manipulate accounting data to present a clean  balance sheet or to reduce their tax liability. Often, they also take aggressive action to boost their  stock price or otherwise influence market value.

Optimistic  projections in turn incline some publics to purchase those firms' equity  offerings, thereby increasing their market value and also signaling other  publics that the firms have the inherent potential to meet some of their  objectives, be they economic or social. The market value and market risk of  firms provides investors and their advisors, as well as firms' competitors and  other auditors, with both firm-specific and comparative information. Ceteris  paribus, investors prefer high market returns and low market risk, suggest-  ing:  Hypothesis 1: The greater a firm's current market perfor-  mance, the better its reputation.  Hypothesis 2: The greater a firm's current performance-  adjusted market risk, the worse its reputation.  Dividend policy. Another aspect of market performance that investors  attend to is a firm's dividend policy (Walter, 1971). Dividend payouts, how-  ever, can signal rival messages. Some publics may interpret high distribu-  tions as indicating that a firm has tapped a more profitable and protected  niche than competitors, but others may regard high distributions as a signal  that the firm's managers lack attractive investment opportunities capable of  ensuring future cash flows (Ross, 1977). These expectations, however,  should also influence the stock price of the firm, increasing it in the first case  and decreasing it in the second. The dividend yield-a ratio of dividend  payout to stock price-is therefore a useful indicator of whether publics take  a short- or long-run view of firms. Ross and Westerfield suggested that "firms  with high growth prospects will generally have lower dividend yields"  (1988: 41). If publics take a long-term view when they assess the reputational  status of a firm, then  Hypothesis 3: The greater a firm's current dividend yield,  the worse its reputation.  Accounting Signals  Accounting data provide an obvious source of information to constitu-  encies interested in firms' economic performance. Financial statements in-  dicate both the current results of prior activities and the current resource  allocations the firms' managers have made. They therefore signal the merits  of firms.  Accounting profitability and risk. Since long-run effectiveness requires  firms to be profitable,  Hypothesis 4: The greater a firm's prior accounting prof-  itability, the better its reputation.  Ceteris paribus, however, publics are risk-averse: Constituents expect a  high level of return from firms whose strategies demonstrate high levels of  risk (Bettis & Mahajan, 1985). For two firms with similar levels of profitabil-  ity, therefore, greater risk should negatively influence publics' assessments.  Hence, This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:41:52 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1990  Fombrun and Shanley  239  Hypothesis 5: The greater a firm's prior performance-  adjusted accounting risk, the worse its reputation.  Institutional Signals  Economic outcomes are not the only source of information important to  all firms' constituencies. Firms belong to institutional environments that  influence constituents' assessments: institutions often hold their stock; some  firms expend heavily on social welfare, frequently through their own foun-  dations; and the news media propagate information about their activities.  Institutional ownership. Patterns of institutional ownership are known  to affect the behavior of firms' managers. For instance, when institutions  hold more of a firm's stock than individuals, managers invest less in R&D  (Graves, 1988). The composition of investors in firms' shares arguably sends  a strong signal to their other constituents. The more institutional investors  there are, the more likely some publics are to view firms favorably, taking it  for granted that careful screening by well-informed portfolio analysts led to  the institutional purchase decision.  Hypothesis 6: The greater the concentration of a firm's  equity among institutions, the better its reputation.  Social responsibility. Publics also judge how well firms respond to their  noneconomic agendas. Perceptions of firms' concern for the wider society  may influence judgments, with social responsiveness signaling that firms  have achieved a mutualistic relationship with potentially powerful groups  in their environments. Social and political involvement, of course, may tie  in directly to a firm's continued ability to operate, or they may represent a  means of thwarting environmental challenges from powerful stakeholders  (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978).  Managers can signal their firms' social concern by contributing to char-  itable causes, developing nonpolluting products, achieving equal opportu-  nity employment, creating foundations, placing women and minority mem-  bers on boards, or adhering to the Sullivan principles3 (Lydenberg, Marlin,  & Strub, 1986; Ryan, Swanson, & Buchholz, 1987). Managers presume that  social responsiveness generates goodwill from employees, consumers, and  other publics that enhances the long-run profitability and viability of firms  and protects their own employment.  Hypothesis 7: The greater a firm's contributions to social  welfare, the better its reputation.  Media visibility. Managers' strategic attempts to influence constituents  contribute to propagating information that in turn gets disseminated through  networks of interpersonal relations or interlocking corporate ties (Mizruchi  & Schwartz, 1987) and through press articles and mass media presentations  3 The Sullivan principles are voluntary guidelines proposed in the mid-1970s by the Rev.  Leon Sullivan to encourage U.S. firms to implement nondiscriminatory labor practices in South  Africa and to support progressive projects for blacks in the communities in which the compa-  nies operate (Lydenberg, Marlin, & Strub, 1986: 30-33).

The media themselves act not only as vehicles for adver-  tising and mirrors of reality reflecting firms' actions, but also as active agents  shaping information through editorials and feature articles (Fombrun &  Abrahamson, 1988).  Publics also differ in how much importance they attach to the domains  in which firms operate. Involvement in a turbulent domain, for instance,  enhances a firm's media visibility. Just as information availability biases  individual judgments (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), the availability of infor-  mation in an arena may shape a particular audience's assessment of firms'  activities: Publics are more likely to perceive as important the domains that  receive the greatest media attention (McQuail, 1985). Greater visibility can  be expected of firms operating in controversial product-market domains (to-  bacco and biotechnology), in national and regional public policy debates  (aerospace and defense), and in risky technologies (nuclear power and  chemicals).  Both the mass media and specialized publications also propagate eval-  uations of firms. Again, much as the availability of information biases indi-  viduals' judgments (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), so may the amount of  information channeled through informal networks, the business press, and  the mass media bias publics' constructions of firms' reputations. Firms fre-  quently and nonnegatively touted by the media might therefore develop  better reputations than other firms because they occupy more central posi-  tions in a social network (Burt, 1983). This suggests two principal hypoth-  eses and an interaction:  Hypothesis 8: The greater a firm's current media visibil-  ity, the better its reputation.  Hypothesis 9: The more nonnegative a firm's current me-  dia coverage, the better its reputation.  Hypothesis 10: Nonnegative coverage and visibility have  a positive, interactive effect on reputation.  Firm size. As institutions in their own right, large firms tend to receive  much public scrutiny. The availability of information may benefit large  firms disproportionally by inflating audiences' familiarity with their activ-  ities (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). Assuming that corporate audiences asked  to rate firms' reputations less readily remember small firms,  Hypothesis 11: The larger the firm, the better its reputa-  tion.  Strategy Signals  Publics also assess firms on the basis of the payoffs likely from their  managers' choice of business and corporate strategies. At the business-unit  level, firms develop differentiated strategic postures by allocating resources  in different ways across functional areas (Fombrun & Ginsberg, 1989). At the  corporate level, firms differ in their diversification postures or the degree to  which their activities span multiple related and unrelated businesses This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:41:52 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1990  Fombrun and Shanley  241  (Rumelt, 1974). The extent of a firm's diversification informs constituents  about corporate managers' preoccupations and therefore signals the firm's  future prospects.  Differentiation. Over time, advertising helps firms develop strategic po-  sitions that are differentiated from their competitors' and that provide them  with a measure of goodwill from consumers and other stakeholders (Rumelt,  1987; Weiss, 1969). Advertising not only signals product and firm charac-  teristics in ways that can reduce constituents' searches for information but  also presents firms in a favorable light.  Common to economic models of reputation building is a view of adver-  tising as a source of product and imaging cues designed to influence the  perceptions of external publics. Strategic decisions represent choices for a  sequence of games4 in which firms advertise to reduce consumer search  (Stigler, 1961), stabilize output disposal (Milgrom & Roberts, 1986a), and  increase barriers to entry (Comanor & Wilson, 1974). Similar models can be  formulated for firms' investments in ensuring inputs and improving  throughputs. Just as advertising helps induce a protected strategic position  that stabilizes sales, so can investments in improved supplier, customer, and  employee relationships enhance the quality of firms' input supplies, im-  prove their pool of new recruits, lower their labor costs, raise their produc-  tivity, and thereby build unique and protected strategic niches (Schuler &  MacMillan, 1984).  If firms develop strategic postures from cumulative resource allocations  across functional domains (Fombrun & Ginsberg, 1989), by deploying re-  sources to research and advertising and by maintaining tightly knit cultures,  stable supplier relations, and high-productivity technologies, managers sig-  nal constituents about firms' strategic postures and transform their own  histories into reputations (Kreps & Spence, 1985). In particular, differentia-  tion may result from advertising allocations.  Hypothesis 12: The greater a firm's advertising intensity,  the better its reputation.  Diversification posture. Some constituents may interpret diversification  as increasing efficiency because administrative costs are likely to fall if a  firm adopts a conglomerate structure. Other constituents, however, may ex-  pect lowered efficiency from diversification because of functional duplica-  tion. The two interpretations may coexist among different publics, and  which one is most influential may depend on the information available  about managers' actions.  Diversification also spreads risk and provides firms with a hedge against  downturns in single products or markets that some investors might welcome  (Bettis & Hall, 1982). Some previous research has cautioned against broad  diversification, however, and noted that the capital markets favor firms that  only diversify into related product-market domains to capitalize on synergy  4 For a current review of game-theoretic approaches to strategy, see Shapiro (1989).

Such interpretations, if believed by firms' con-  stituents, suggest that relatedness enhances firms' reputations.  If reputations partly reflect publics' interpretations of the merits of  firms' strategic postures, the reputations of unrelated diversifiers might de-  cline, not only because constituents expect them not to capitalize on pro-  duction synergies between domains, but also because inclusion under a  broad corporate umbrella hampers actual capital allocations within divi-  sions. Unrelated firms, for instance, may spirit cash away from profitable  divisions instead of reinvesting it in needed R&D (Hoskisson & Hitt, 1988),  spend less on advertising (Bettis, 1981), and carry a high percentage of debt  (Barton & Gordon, 1988)-actions that may worsen a firm's external image  and increase its perceived riskiness to investors.  Finally, corporate managers of unrelated diversifiers control the release  of division-level data and may be less encumbered by the reporting require-  ments of public auditors than their counterparts in focused firms (Ronen,  1982). Unrelated diversification may make a firm more opaque to constitu-  ents because of corporate managers' greater ability to control the presenta-  tion of divisional results and activities in consolidated public statements.  External audiences might therefore discount unrelated portfolios because  informational signals about individual divisions may be ambiguous and dis-  torted, may serve the purposes of incumbent managers, and hence may be  more difficult to interpret than signals from focused firms. Jointly, these  arguments suggest that  Hypothesis 13: The greater a firm's unrelated diversifica-  tion, the worse its reputation.  Unrelated diversification may also make evaluation difficult and am-  biguous by reducing the credibility and effectiveness of corporate informa-  tion and advertising. Unrelated diversification obscures divisional contribu-  tions to corporate profitability, making external assessments of activities  tentative. Moreover, the trend toward takeovers and "deconglomeration" in  the mid-1980s may have made unrelated diversifiers even more suspect to  constituents (Galambos & Pratt, 1988). Since achieving synergistic relation-  ships across unrelated businesses is a daunting task requiring the constant  transfer of capital and know-how, we suggest that, lacking detailed and  credible information about divisions, publics may be driven to rely on a  broader set of signals in assessing firms with high levels of unrelated diver-  sification.  Hypothesis 14: The determinants of reputation are more  varied for unrelated diversifiers than for focused firms.  DATA AND METHODS  The 292 firms included in Fortune's 1985 study of corporate reputation  constituted the set of firms for this analysis. The Fortune survey, which  solicited ratings of corporate excellence from 8,000 executives, outside di-  rectors, and securities analysts, had a 50 percent response rate (Hutton, This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:41:52 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1990  Fombrun and Shanley  243  1986: 16-18). Respondents did not rate all the firms; they rated only those  in their own industry or economic sector. Firms were rated relative to their  principal competitors on eight attributes of reputation. We obtained sum-  mary data for the 1985 Fortune study from Erdos and Morgan, New York, the  firm that conducted the study.  Accounting data for these firms were obtained from Standard and Poor's  COMPUSTAT industrial and business segment tapes, which include ac-  counting information regularly reported by public firms to the Securities and  Exchange Commission (SEC). Data were selected for the end of fiscal 1984  and represent the most highly publicized accounting information available  to respondents at the time they were surveyed.  Market performance and institutional ownership data came from the  O'Neill Datagraphs (William O'Neill and Company, Inc., 1985). Data on  media citations throughout 1985 came from the Business Periodical Index  (H. W. Wilson Company, 1986). We obtained data on 1984 charitable con-  tributions from the Taft Corporate Giving Directory (Taft Group, Inc., 1986),  the Corporate Foundation Profiles (Foundation Center, 1986), and Corporate  500: The Directory of Corporate Philanthropy (Public Management Institute,  1986). Data on foundations were coded from The Foundation Directory  (Foundation Research Center, 1985).  COMPUSTAT data for regularly reported variables were not available  for all 292 firms Fortune reported on, resulting in the loss of 23 firms because  of missing data or post-1984 mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures. We  referred to the 269 remaining firms as group 1. The inclusion of advertising  expenditures-data not regularly reported to the SEC-and charitable con-  tributions further reduced the study set to 157 firms (group 2). Use of models  including diversification data further reduced the set under investigation to  119 firms (group 3).5  Representativeness  Since both the survey design and missing values made the final set of  firms nonrandom, we investigated the extent to which the two subsets,  groups 2 and 3, were representative of the Fortune sample (group 1). Firms  included in group 2 differed significantly from excluded firms on sales,  income, and number of employees. When these variables were standardized  to sector means and standard deviations, the only significant difference was  in 1984 sales (p < .01). The results of t-tests on group 3 firms showed that  they had no significant differences from group 2 firms but had significant  differences in size (measured as sales and income) from firms excluded from  group 3. These differences remained after we had controlled for sector ef-  5 The number of firms in groups 2 and 3 actually used in the analyses reported in Table 3  were further reduced to 154 and 115, respectively, because of missing values on firms' risk for  which complete data were required for 1975-83.

Excluded firms did not, however, differ significantly from included  firms in either group 2 or group 3 on the key independent variables used in  the analyses.6  To check that included firms were representative of the original set, we  derived three regression models of reputation using three predictor variables  for which we had complete data: profitability, size, and visibility. The first  model was based on group 2 firms, the second on firms excluded by missing  values from group 2, and the third on pooling the two sets of firms to re-  constitute group 1.  All three models were nearly identical in the size and direction of their  beta coefficients and explained 27-35 percent of the variation in reputation.  A Chow test showed no significant difference between included and ex-  cluded firms (F3,272 = 2.08, p > .10). We calculated differences between  predicted values for each pair of models and found them to be normally  distributed around a mean of zero. There was therefore no reason to suspect  that the form of the relationship between variables would be different for  excluded firms than for included firms because of missing data on predictor  variables.  Measures  Corporate reputation. The dependent variable was reputation, an index  formed from ratings respondents provided on eight 11-point scales (0 =  poor, 10 = excellent) to the Fortune survey, which was conducted between  September and December of 1985.7 The survey began by asking respondents  to name the leading firms in an economic sector and continued: "How would  you rate these companies on each of the following attributes: quality of  management; quality of products or services; long-term investment value;  innovativeness; financial soundness; ability to attract, develop, and keep  talented people; community and environmental responsibility; and use of  corporate assets?"  Previous studies using Fortune's ratings have relied on single dimen-  sions and typically investigated either the correlates of one dimension of  reputation or its consequences. For example, McGuire, Sundgren, and  Schneeweis (1988), Conine and Madden (1986), and Chakravarthy (1986) all  investigated social responsibility. The pattern of correlations among these  6 Differences between included and excluded firms reflect the fact that smaller and less  profitable firms do not advertise as much or give as much to charity as larger, more profitable  firms do. However, this fact did not prevent our generalizing from the results of analyses of  included firms to excluded firms.  7 Fortune declines to specify the exact time during which the survey was conducted. Since  they announced the study in August 1985 and provided summary results in January 1986, we  concluded that all questionnaires were filled out during the last quarter (September-December)  of 1985. All market measures used in this study were therefore estimated for September 27,  1985.

To overcome the limitations of analyzing separate dimensions of repu-  tation, we created an index of overall reputation from the eight single di-  mensions (a = .97). A varimax factor analysis of the eight attributes ex-  tracted a single factor with an eigenvalue of 6.68 that accounted for 84  percent of the variance. Factor analyses of other surveys conducted by For-  tune in the last quarters of 1982, 1983, 1984, and 1986 supported the stability  of this factor solution and justified our conclusion that the eight attributes  elicited from respondents were components of an underlying and stable  construct of reputation. We adjusted overall reputation for sector differences  since the Fortune survey asked people to assess firms' reputations in com-  parison to those of other firms competing in the same primary sector. We  also used the three additional scores for reputations at the end of calendar  years 1982, 1983, and 1984 in a cross-sectional time series model.  Sector. All variables in the analyses reported below were normalized  with respect to the means and standard deviations of the economic sectors  defined in Fortune. These sectors are similar, though not identical, to two-  digit Standard Industrial Classification codes and represent the primary eco-  nomic involvements of firms in the study.8 Normalization by these sectors,  though imperfect, makes firms roughly equivalent in terms of primary eco-  nomic or historical commitments and is especially justified because the  Fortune survey asked respondents to rate firms relative to other firms in the  same primary sector (Hutton, 1986: 16-18).  Size. Size was computed as a logarithmic transformation of total sales in  1984.  Economic performance. Economic performance was gauged in three  ways: (1) by prior-year accounting profitability, measured as return on in-  vested capital (ROIC) at the end of fiscal year 1984, a measure that is inde-  pendent of capital structure (Nathanson, 1980); (2) by the ratio of market to  book value (for September 27, 1985), a measure that captured market value  just prior to the assessments of firms' reputations in fall 1985; and (3) by the  yield, for September 27, 1985, a ratio of the prior four quarters' dividends  divided by share price on that date.  Riskiness. The level of accounting risk in 1984 was estimated by the  coefficient of variation (the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean) of  ROIC in the previous nine years, 1975-83 (Martin & Gray, 1971). A market  measure of risk was gauged by firms' beta coefficients on September 27,  1985. Beta coefficients are commonly used measures of the systematic risk of  a firm-the degree to which movement in a firm's stock is associated with  general stock market movements.  8 We use the term "sector" to distinguish these domains of economic activity from  "industry," a term increasingly applied to business-level activity at the four-digit SIC code  level.

The concentration of a firm's stock in institu-  tional hands was estimated as a variable called institutional ownership,  representing the percentage of all outstanding shares held on September 27,  1985, by banks, insurance companies, and mutual funds.  Media exposure. Media visibility was estimated as the total number of  articles written about a firm in 1985, the calendar period most closely match-  ing the period during which this survey's respondents would have formed  their individual judgments of firms. We included the full year because of  uncertainty about the actual timing of survey responses. We also tabulated  the month-to-month distribution of articles for a 10 percent random sample  of firms to check for bias in the timing of articles during the year. Although  there was variation for individual firms, the aggregate distribution of articles  throughout the year was not significantly different from the distribution of a  random sample drawn from a uniform distribution (t = 1.4, p > .20), sug-  gesting that there would be no systematic bias from using the full year of  news reports. The resulting indicator was adjusted for both sector and size  effects because we expected variations in the firms' sizes to skew the distri-  bution of media citations and expected differences in coverage between  sectors. A rater then content-analyzed the titles of the 15,400 articles found  and classified each as indicating either positive or negative news about a  firm.9 Announcements concerning performance, new products, or a new  CEO were "good" news, and news about crises, regulation, or federal inves-  tigation was "bad." To check the reliability of the index, three raters inde-  pendently rated a 10 percent subset of the articles (2,132 titles); agreement  with the principal rater was high, with a .88 coefficient of reliability. We  therefore created a favorability index, calculating the degree to which media  reports were not negative as the proportion of positive and neutral ratings  received.  Differentiation. A firm's total advertising expenditures in 1984, ad-  justed for firm size, was the measure of advertising intensity. We estimated  a firm's charitable contributions during 1984, adjusted for firm size,10 for the  measure "charity." A dummy variable called foundation was used to dis-  tinguish between firms that had a separately endowed foundation in 1984  through which they funneled charitable contributions and those with no  such foundation.  Diversification. COMPUSTAT's business segment tape provides data on  firms' annual sales by segment, a business domain that can encompass both  9 We considered coding a "neutral" category but found it less reliable than "positive" and  "negative." Raters tended to either over- or underuse the neutral category. Very few items  proved difficult to code into the more restrictive categorization, and those were eliminated.  10 We also tried adjusting charitable donations for net income rather than total sales to  account for the possibility that firms might use different rules of thumb in budgeting resources  to advertising (total sales) and to charitable causes (prior net income) (Burt, 1983). The results  were similar to those with the reported variable.

Up to 2 four-digit codes are reported for  each segment. From these data, we created a continuous Herfindahl-type"  measure of diversification across segments at the end of fiscal year 1985,  calculated as 1 - (E Salesj2)/( Salesj)2, where j = the number of segments.  As Montgomery (1982) showed, this measure is highly correlated with  Rumelt's (1974) categorical measure of relatedness, so firms with high scores  on the index are more likely to encompass less related businesses under their  corporate umbrellas than firms with low scores on the index. However, the  COMPUSTAT data base does not report the exact percentage of segment  sales in each four-digit business. To better account for relatedness, we there-  fore assigned segment-level sales equally to distinct four-digit industries  only when they did not fall under the umbrella of the same two-digit sector  (Amit & Livnat, 1988; Wally, 1989).  Analyses  Table 1 presents the basic descriptive statistics for all the independent  variables incorporated in the analyses and the intercorrelations among these  variables after adjustment for economic sector. The low intercorrelations  among adjusted predictor variables used in the models gave us no reason to  suspect multicollinearity, and various diagnostic tests run on derived re-  gression models confirmed that it was not a problem.  The analyses were carried out in three steps, the first of which was  calculation of a cross-sectional time series model that explains reputation in  terms of four signals derived from prior-year accounting data.  Second, we modeled market measures as a function of prior-year ac-  counting information. Since market measures already embody publicly  available information about firms, we created standardized residual scores  for the market-book ratio, beta, yield, and visibility, the only variables for  which prior-year accounting data had strong effects. The residual scores  ensured the independence of those variables from profitability, risk, adver-  tising, and size and represented the information remaining in the variables  after the influence of previously distributed, readily available accounting  information had been removed. We then incorporated these residuals into  models of corporate reputation designed to test the hypothesized relation-  ships presented in Figure 1.  Third, to investigate the effects of informational signals on the reputa-  tions of firms with differing levels of diversity, we split the subset of firms  for which diversification level could be calculated at the median value of  their ratings on that variable. We created the two groups to see if publics rely  on different informational signals in constructing the reputations of diver-  sified firms of greater or lesser relatedness.  1 For a detailed discussion of Herfindahl-type and related entropy measures, see Amit and  Livnat (1988).

Together, these categories represented 30 percent of  the firms under study, and noneconomic informational cues appeared par-  ticularly relevant to explaining their reputations. Despite the firms' rela-  tively high profitability, for instance, publics assigned worse reputations to  such diverse firms as Pepsico, Polaroid, and RCA, suggesting that constitu-  ents are judging the prospects of these firms on other than accounting prof-  itability. Similarly, firms like Eastman Kodak, Merrill Lynch, General Elec-  tric, Texas Instruments, and Gencorp enjoyed better reputations than their  profitability levels would warrant. On what basis did constituents form judg-  ments of these firms' prospects? To address this question requires multivari-  ate models that incorporate more than accounting profitability as a predictor  of reputation.  Cross-sectional Time Series  The influence of four variables for which we had complete data on the  three-year time series of corporate reputations for the ends of fiscal years  1982, 1983, and 1984 were first investigated. Those data provide a first-order  test of the influence that accounting signals have on constituents' assess-  ments of reputation. Table 2 presents the standardized model.  The cross-sectional time series analysis on 557 firm-years indicates ba-  sic support for Hypotheses 4, 5, 11, and 12. As expected, assessments of  reputation appear to be positively related to prior accounting profitability,  advertising intensity, and size and negatively related to prior performance-  adjusted risk. Although the pooling of firm-years violates the least-squares  Cross-sectional Time Series Analysis of Corporate Reputation, 1982-84a  TABLE 2  Independent Variables Adjusted Reputation  Profitability .42 **  Risk -.21**  Advertising .10 *  Size .17 **  Adjusted R2 .30 * *  df 4,552  F 21.45  a The independent variables were calculated for the year before the year of data collection;  reputation is for the year of data collection.  ** p < .01  *** p < .001 This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:41:52 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  250  Academy of Management Journal  June  assumption of independence, a Durbin-Watson statistic of 1.94 suggests that  autocorrelation did not seriously affect the stability of the model (p < .01).  Regression Models  To investigate the joint influence of both prior accounting information  and current market and institutional signals on publics' assessments, we  calculated various models that assess the influence of residual scores for the  market-book ratio, beta, yield, and visibility against other informational sig-  nals. Table 3 presents results for these models.  Model 1 confirms the results of the cross-sectional time series analysis  and provides significant support for Hypotheses 4, 5, 11, and 12, relating  accounting signals to publics' assessments of firms. Profitability, advertising  intensity, and size positively influence assessments of reputation, and ac-  counting risk has a strong negative effect.  Hypotheses 1 and 3 were also supported.

The data did not, however, support  Hypothesis 2. Residual information embodied in firms' beta coefficients  does not appear to influence reputations.  Hypothesis 6 predicts that institutional ownership will positively affect  reputations. Model 1 corroborates the hypothesis that publics tend to assign  higher reputations to firms with a high proportion of stock held by banks,  insurance companies, and mutual funds.  Hypotheses 8-10 propose that firms' exposure through the media will  significantly influence reputational judgments. The results indicate that re-  sidual visibility negatively influences reputations, refuting Hypothesis 8:  With size controlled, model 1 suggests that the higher a firms' visibility per  unit of sales and hence the greater the scrutiny of the firm by the press, the  worse its reputation. Contrary to expectations, model 1 also fails to provide  support for Hypothesis 9, stating that the greater the volume of nonnegative  coverage, the better a firm's reputation. Nor does there appear to be any  interaction between nonnegative coverage and the intensity of scrutiny of  firms by the media, as Hypothesis 10 proposes.  Figure 1 suggested that firms' responsiveness to social concerns would  positively influence publics' assessments. The significance of the beta coef-  ficients for the charity and foundation variables support Hypothesis 7: Pub-  lics assign higher reputations to firms that have foundations and give pro-  portionally more to charity than other firms.  Altogether, the results of model 1 provide significant support for the  hypotheses shown in Figure 1. The strengths of the variables' contributions  to explained variance can be examined by comparing the beta coefficients. In  descending order of importance, they are: (1) accounting signals of profit-  ability and risk, (2) market valuation, (3) media visibility, (4) dividend yield,  (5) size of firm, and (6) boundary-spanning through foundations, charitable  contributions, and advertising.  Diversification  In model 2, we added the Herfindahl measure of firm diversification to  model 1. The results indicate that diversification tends to negatively influ-  ence publics' assessments of reputation, supporting Hypothesis 13. Since  the beta coefficients of the other variables change, however, model 2 sug-  gests that publics may draw on different informational inputs in construct-  ing the reputations of firms of various levels of diversification. To examine  the signals used in constructing these reputations, we calculated models 3  and 4, which present the results of model 2 broken out at the median value  of diversification. Following Montgomery (1982), we assumed that firms  with low diversification tended to be more focused and that firms with high  diversification were involved in a broad range of businesses.

To  further test for significant differences between firms of low and high diver-  sity, we computed a set of moderator regression models by introducing in-  teractions of each variable with diversification. Diversification only signifi-  cantly moderated the effects on reputation of media visibility (p = .09),  nonnegative media appraisals (p = .03), the interaction of visibility with  those appraisals (p = .002), size (p = .11), and dividend yield (p = .15),  with the last two effects relatively weak. Given this pattern and the results of  models 3 and 4, the results appear consistent with Hypothesis 14: Publics  appear to rely on different criteria and a broader range of informational  inputs to assess the reputations of diversified firms than they use to interpret  the activities of focused firms.  DISCUSSION  Economists have proposed dynamic models to explain why firms invest  in reputation building (Weigelt & Camerer, 1988; Wilson, 1985). They have  neglected to consider, however, the institutional context within which rep-  utations develop. In this study, we emphasized the social community within  which firms themselves are embedded and the central role played by firms,  constituents, and the media in influencing the informational context within  which reputational judgments are made. Economists may benefit from ac-  commodating such an institutional understanding of corporate reputations  in their game-theoretic models.  The results of this study support an understanding of firms as involved  in a competitive market for reputational status in which, because of infor-  mational asymmetries, firms signal their key characteristics to constituents.  Consistent with the logic of Figure 1, our findings show that publics appear  to construct reputations from a mix of signals derived from accounting and  market information, media reports, and other noneconomic cues. Firms'  risk-return profiles, resource allocations, social responsiveness, institutional  ownership, media exposure, and corporate diversification postures signal  constituents about firms' prospects and generate reputations.  The analyses confirmed our suspicion that a limited bivariate analysis  linking short-term profitability to reputation would be misleading: The mul-  tivariate models suggest that historical performance and other noneconomic  cues also influence reputations, and that must be true particularly for the 51  firms for which reputations and short-term profitability were out of line.  A broad range of economic and noneconomic signals emanating from  firms help predict publics' reputational orderings within sectors. Most sig-  nificantly, and as expected, accounting measures of profitability and risk  and market value most strongly affected judgments of firms. Also important,  however, were firms' reflected visibility in the media, the extent to which  institutions held their stock, their dividend yield to investors, and their  demonstrations of social concern.

Banks, in-  surance companies, and, increasingly, investment funds occupy central po-  sitions in the economy (Mintz & Schwartz, 1985). Our results suggest that by  purchasing a firm's equity in capital markets, institutional investors signal  constituents about the merits of the firm's activities. Since these signals are  incorporated into constituents' reputational assessments, they may consti-  tute a path through which institutional investment patterns influence man-  agers themselves and possibly alter competitive dynamics in industries.  The finding that intensive media scrutiny has a strong negative effect on  firms' reputations was surprising, particularly since it did not matter  whether those ratings were favorable or unfavorable, except for diversified  firms, for which nonnegative press improved reputation. We suggest three  explanations: (1) media reporters deem newsworthy only events that im-  pugn corporate managements, (2) external publics react negatively to all  forms of publicity, and (3) only negatively predisposed evaluators rely on  media accounts of firms.  However, since this study's coder rated an average of 87 percent of the  article titles analyzed as not negative, the business media do not appear to be  predominantly negative in their reviews of firms. Moreover, a scan of se-  lected news reports indicated that detailed accounts varied widely in tone,  making them inherently ambiguous informational vehicles. Finally, it seems  difficult to defend the view that evaluators who rely on media-generated  signals are inherently negative.  The data in Table 3 demonstrate the interaction of diversification with  media exposure. Since media visibility, the extent of nonnegative coverage,  and the interaction of visibility and nonnegative coverage do not influence  publics' assessments of focused firms but are all significant for diversified  firms, we propose that constituents rely on media accounts in the absence of  confidence in firm-generated data. Since benefits only accrue to diversified  firms at the cost of increased complexity (Montgomery, 1985), it may be that  publics turn to the media because information is either too difficult to obtain  from these firms directly or is seen as unreliable when it is so obtained.  More broadly, the influence of diversification on the reputation-  building models suggests that publics draw on different and fewer sources of  information in making judgments about focused firms than they do when  making judgments about diversified firms. Diversification itself appears to  encourage publics to broaden their search for information when constructing  their assessments. In contrast, the publics of focused firms construct their  judgments principally from accounting and market measures of both perfor-  mance and risk, institutional ownership patterns, and advertising (Milgrom  & Roberts, 1986a). We therefore speculate that focused firms appear more  easily interpretable to evaluators, making economic signals less ambiguous This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:41:52 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  254  Academy of Management Journal  June  and their reputations less susceptible to influence by the media and other  external monitors.  CONCLUSIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE RESEARCH  This study made a preliminary attempt to fuse economic and sociolog-  ical approaches to the study of firms' interactions with their publics. Little  previous empirical research has viewed firms as involved in a competitive  market for reputational status. Yet, the judgments of publics collectively  create reputations that stratify industries, with potentially significant com-  petitive advantages accruing to firms with higher perceived reputational  status (Caves & Porter, 1977; Weigelt & Camerer, 1988). This study demon-  strated how students of strategy might benefit from investigating the infor-  mational bedrock upon which firms' reputations rest.  Future research should attempt to specify the particular interpretive  process through which firms' investments become cognitions in the minds  of individual constituents, whether based on product and image advertising  or on firms' internal commitments of funds to R&D or their labor force. Firms  actively intrude into their environments, not only through resource deploy-  ments (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978), but also through social networks (Laumann  & Knoke, 1987; Shrum & Wuthnow, 1988) and carefully disseminated self-  presentations like annual reports (Ryan et al., 1987; Salancik & Meindl,  1984). Much as employees in organizations invest in activities to win pro-  motions, so may organizations invest in activities that afford them good  marks in interorganizational fields (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). Students of  strategy should appreciate how firms' actions intertwine with those of rivals  through elaborate networks of constituents to create a distinct social collec-  tivity with emergent properties (Fombrun, 1986).  Methodologically, researchers should attend to the longitudinal process  through which reputations attain stability and structure. Yearly budget al-  locations do not in and of themselves generate stable reputations; rather, the  cumulative investments that firms consistently make in different domains  over long time spans are more likely to influence the cognitive interpreta-  tions of stakeholders. Although it may be reasonable to assume-as we did  in this study-that the yearly budgets of large firms are highly correlated  with their long-term total investments, future research could directly assess  these cumulative investments. Like electromagnetic signals, reputations  may have a long-term component that reflects cumulative investments.  Short-term noise may, however, obstruct the transmission if cross-sectional  analyses are relied upon. Even if reputations reflect long-term status order-  ings, they can change as a result of short-term actions, whether intentional or  accidental. Separating the short- and long-term components of reputational  signals should be the subject of much future debate in the analysis of cor-  porate reputation building.  Another direction for future research lies in better specifying the dimen-  sionality of the construct: Do firms have one reputation or many? Do repu- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Sun, 26 Feb 2017 21:41:52 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1990  Fombrun and Shanley  255  tations significantly differ by either domain or audience? This study as-  sumed a single underlying construct of reputation produced by aggregating  findings across multiple domains. Factor analyses of the Fortune data we  used here and the similarity of the respondents in the study to other audi-  ences firms confront supported that assumption. A more extensive study of  reputation might enrich our understanding of the construct by including  other audiences with which firms interact, such as consumers and employ-  ees. Incorporating more domain-specific components might make it possible  to distinguish central and peripheral influences on firms' reputations.  Although cash disbursements had considerable signaling value for the  publics' studied, future research might also consider if short-term jolts such  as CEO successions, mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, and new product  developments affect reputations in the way they affect stock market behav-  ior. Corporate catastrophes like Union Carbide's 1985 Bhopal accident and  the failure of Continental Illinois in 1984 undoubtedly damage reputations.  How long-lived are these effects? Does competent handling of crises dampen  their negative effects? Johnson and Johnson's successful turnaround of the  Tylenol crisis in 1984 suggests that competent handling may well moderate  the reputational effects of environmental jolts.  Finally, analyses of the consequences of established reputations-and  major changes in reputations-for competitive dynamics in an industry are  needed to complement this research. Positive reputations are often said to  attract investors, lower the cost of capital, and enhance the competitive  ability of firms. Managers may strive to enhance employee welfare, not only  to increase the likelihood of compliance with directives, but also to signal  potential workers about working conditions and internal norms (Kreps &  Spence, 1985; Spence, 1974). In turn, firms that develop reputations for  attending to employee welfare may find themselves in a good bargaining  position in labor markets, attract better applicants, and achieve lower costs  (Stigler, 1962). However, few empirical studies have actually demonstrated  these effects, probably because, as we have argued, a firm's acquired repu-  tation is only likely to affect performance marginally. Investigating reputa-  tion's influence requires a fully articulated model of organizational perfor-  mance that also acknowledges the effects of market, product, and strategy  variables. To tease out the marginal effect of reputation on performance  would therefore require extending the present analyses over time and de-  veloping, in tandem with surveys like Fortune's, a data base of strategic,  market, and environmental variables that would allow the matching of  changes in reputation with changes in underlying influents and thus enable  the modeling of joint consequences.  If reputations confer competitive advantage, they constitute important  barriers to firms' mobility within industries and into related or unrelated  industries. How resilient are reputations, how sound an investment, how  much of an asset? To identify the effects of reputation on mobility, compet-  itiveness, and ultimately, on performance, is a formidable and potentially  rewarding research challenge.
