REVISITING THE PERFORMANCE CONSEQUENCES OF CEO  SUCCESSION: THE IMPACTS OF SUCCESSOR TYPE,  POSTSUCCESSION SENIOR EXECUTIVE TURNOVER,  AND DEPARTING CEO TENURE  WEI SHEN  University  of  Florida  ALBERT A.  CANNELLA, Jr.  Texas  A&M University  Highlighting the  importance of  succession  context, this  study  examines  the  perfor-  mance impacts of successor type, postsuccession  senior executive turnover, and de-  parting CEO tenure. Following a power circulation theory of control, we distinguished  three types of CEO successors: followers, contenders, and outsiders. Our theory and  evidence from a sample of 228 CEO successions suggest that successor type interacts  with postsuccession senior executive turnover to influence firm return on assets (ROA)  and that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between departing CEO tenure and  postsuccession firm ROA.  In the past several decades, research on the per-  formance  consequences  of  CEO succession  has  been  extensive  but  characterized by  inconsistent  findings and debates about causes and effects (e.g.,  Brown,  1982;  Carroll, 1984;  Friedman & Singh,  1989; Gamson & Scotch, 1964; Grusky, 1963; Have-  man,  1993;  Lubatkin, Chung,  Rogers, & Owers,  1989;  Wiersema,  1995;  Zajac,  1990).  The  general  observation  has been  made  that it is not the event  of  CEO succession per se, but the succession context,  that  affects  postsuccession  firm  performance  (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1996: 193-201).  Succes-  sor origin, a key successor characteristic that refers  to whether a new CEO comes from inside or outside  the firm whose  chief executive he or she becomes,  has been  proposed as important. Successor origin  both reflects succession context and has significant  implications  for  subsequent  firm  performance  (Brady & Helmich, 1984). However, empirical stud-  ies also report inconsistent evidence regarding the  performance impacts of insider and outsider suc-  cession,  even when the influence of presuccession  firm performance has been controlled (for a review,  see Kesner and Sebora [1994]).  In this  study,  we  strove to  capture succession  context  more  completely  than  previous  research  has  and to  enhance  understanding of  the  perfor-  mance consequences  of CEO succession  by simul-  We thank Bob Hoskisson, Jing Zhou, Catherine Daily,  and three anonymous reviewers for their helpful  com-  ments and suggestions.  717  taneously examining three important components  of  succession  contexts.  First, we  focused  on  key  characteristics of CEO successors, but we diverged  from previous research in that we did not dichoto-  mize  CEO successors into  insiders  and outsiders.  Adopting  a  power  circulation  theory  of  control,  which  takes  intrafirm  contention  into  account  (Ocasio, 1994; Ocasio & Kim, 1999), we  propose  herein that there are two  distinct types  of insider  successors: those appointed following their prede-  cessors' dismissals  and those appointed following  their  predecessors'  ordinary retirements. We  la-  beled these two types of inside successors contend-  ers  and  followers,  respectively.  Thus,  including  outsiders, we examined three types of CEO succes-  sors. These three types of successors-contenders,  followers,  and outsiders-differ  importantly with  respect their ability to manage change, their firm-  specific  knowledge, and the risk of adverse selec-  tion  (selection  of  an  unsuitable  successor)  they  pose. We expected them to have different impacts  on firm performance.  Second, we focused on postsuccession executive  turnover at the  top  management team  level.  Ac-  cording to upper echelons theory, it is not a firm's  CEO alone, but  its  entire management team, that  shapes strategic decisions  (Dooley & Fryxell, 1999;  Hambrick, Cho, & Chen, 1996; Hambrick & Mason,  1984).  Senior  executive  turnover influences  top  management team composition (Wagner, Pfeffer, &  O'Reilly, 1984) and may have a significant impact  on strategic decision making and firm performance  (Virany, Tushman, & Romanelli, 1992). However,  718  Academy  of Management  Journal  August  its performance impact has not received much in-  vestigation in  previous research. We propose that  senior  executive  turnover following  CEO succes-  sion  reflects top management team dynamics and  that its impact on firm performance will be moder-  ated by successor type.  Lastly, we focused on CEO succession frequency  at the organizational level by examining the influ-  ence  of  a  departing CEO's tenure. Frequent CEO  successions  may disrupt organizational continuity  and hurt firm performance (Grusky, 1963; Kesner &  Sebora, 1994). At the same time, long CEO tenure  has been found to be directly linked to top manage-  ment's commitment to  the  status quo  (Hambrick,  Geletkanycz, & Fredrickson, 1993) and decreases in  the  fit between  firm strategy, structure, and envi-  ronmental demands (Miller, 1991). Drawing on the  organizational change literature, we  propose that  departing CEO tenure  importantly affects  subse-  quent firm performance through its impact on or-  ganizational inertia and the disruption surrounding  a succession  event.  Previous research has  suggested that many fac-  tors  influence  firm  performance. The  impact  of  some factors, such as firm size,  governance struc-  ture, and  industry environment, may be  particu-  larly significant in the CEO succession context ow-  ing  to  their  potential  influence  over  managerial  discretion (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1996). To re-  duce the influence  of confounding factors, we  in-  cluded  several  control variables in  our  analysis:  successor industry experience; firm size, diversifi-  cation,  presuccession  performance,  and  gover-  nance structure; and industry performance and in-  stability. Figure 1 illustrates our proposed model of  the performance consequences of CEO succession.  Firm performance is  a  multidimensional  phe-  nomenon  that has  been  measured with  both  ac-  counting- and market-based indicators in previous  research (e.g., Daily, Certo, & Dalton, 2000; Finkel-  stein  & Hambrick,  1990;  Ocasio,  1994;  Zajac, 1990).  Accounting  measures  reflect  the  current  opera-  tional  performance of  a  firm, while  market mea-  sures indicate investors' perceptions of the firm's  future performance potential  (Daily et  al.,  2000).  Our study  focused  on  firms'  operational perfor-  mance rather than market valuation for the follow-  ing reasons: First, market valuation is often subject  to forces beyond management control; in contrast,  operational performance is  more  under  manage-  ment control (Grossman & Hoskisson, 1998; Ham-  brick & Finkelstein, 1995). Second, boards of direc-  tors often find  that accounting measures provide  convenient  targets for management to  reach (Jos-  kow, Rose, & Shepard, 1993) and are more likely  to  link  them  (rather than  market valuation)  to  CEO compensation (Hambrick & Finkelstein, 1995;  Jensen & Murphy, 1990).  Thus,  management has  A Model of the Performance Consequences of CEO Succession  FIGURE 1  2002  Shen  and  Cannella  719  incentives to focus on operational performance. Fi-  nally,  in  the  succession  literature, financial event  studies  have  generally used  market indicators to  examine  immediate  investor  reactions to  succes-  sion  announcements  rather than  the  actual  cash  flows  generated by the firms over the first two  or  three years  of  new  CEOs' tenures  (Finkelstein  &  Hambrick, 1996: 201). Our study is  an attempt to  understand  the  impact  of  CEO succession  on  a  firm's actual operational performance, not investor  reactions or market valuation.  THEORY AND  HYPOTHESES  Three  Types  of  CEO Successors  Organization and strategy scholars studying CEO  succession  often dichotomize CEO successors into  insiders and outsiders: insiders are executives pro-  moted from within the firm, and outsiders come to  new  CEO  positions  from  other  organizations  (Allen,  Panian,  & Lotz,  1979;  Dalton  & Kesner,  1985; Helmich  & Brown, 1972; Kesner & Dalton,  1994; Wiersema, 1995; Zajac, 1990). The assump-  tion in most research is that inside  successors are  appointed under conditions of good company per-  formance and  reflect  intent  to  maintain  strategic  continuity,  and  outside  successors  are appointed  under  conditions  of  poor  company  performance  and reflect intent to initiate strategic change (Brady  & Helmich, 1984). We agree that firms do not typ-  ically  appoint outside  successors unless  they face  the pressure of initiating strategic change, coupled  with  an  unavailability  of  competent  inside  suc-  cessor  candidates  (Cannella  &  Lubatkin,  1993;  Fredrickson, Hambrick, & Baumrin, 1988; Ocasio,  1999). However, we propose that the appointment  of an inside  successor does not necessarily reflect  intent to maintain strategic continuity. This prop-  osition is grounded in a power circulation theory of  control, and it separates our study from mainstream  succession  research.  The power circulation theory of control (Jackall,  1988; Ocasio, 1994; Ocasio & Kim, 1999) suggests  that incumbent CEOs face a risk of power contests  initiated by  other senior executives  as well  as by  outsider directors. CEOs are surrounded by senior  executives who are typically ambitious individuals  with  strong  needs  for  power  and  control.  The  power of a CEO is thus, from time to time, subject to  challenge and contestation from these senior exec-  utives  (Pfeffer, 1981, 1992). The likelihood  of CEO  turnover is significantly increased when questions  arise about an incumbent's capabilities and viable  inside candidates exist (Ocasio, 1994). Research on  successor selection has also shown that inside suc-  cessors are often appointed in periods of poor firm  performance (Dalton & Kesner, 1985; Friedman &  Singh, 1989), even in situations of forced CEO de-  parture (Parrino, 1997). Although this phenomenon  has been proposed to reflect managerial entrench-  ment (Boeker & Goodstein, 1993), we believe that it  more likely reflects the outcome of power struggles  within top management. According to power circu-  lation theory (Ocasio, 1994; Ocasio & Kim, 1999);  an inside  succession  following  a CEO's dismissal  reflects a successful internal power contest against  the CEO, and the successor is a contending execu-  tive who has won the support and approval of the  board of directors. In this situation, the inside suc-  cessor, whom  we  refer to  as a contender, is  more  likely  to  be  charged with  a  mandate to  initiate  strategic change, as is  the  case in  an outside  suc-  cession, rather than a mandate to maintain strategic  continuity.  In contrast, if  an inside  successor  is  appointed  following  the  predecessor's  ordinary  retirement  rather than dismissal,  the  successor's mandate is  more likely to be to maintain strategic continuity,  as  proposed  in  previous  research (Brady & Hel-  mich, 1984; Datta & Rajagopalan, 1998; Friedman &  Singh,  1989).  Because  successors  who  follow  a  CEO's ordinary retirement are  often  expected  to  continue  and follow  their predecessors' strategies  (Hambrick et al., 1993), we refer them as followers.  Thus, as noted above, including outsider succes-  sors, there are three types  of CEO successors: fol-  lowers,  contenders,  and  outsiders.  These  three  types of CEO successors will have different impacts  on  postsuccession  firm  operational performance.  We view  three sets of factors as the source of per-  formance effects: firm-specific knowledge, change  initiatives, and the risk of adverse selection. In our  conceptualization,  change  initiatives  have  two  parts-a  board mandate  for  alterations of  firm's  strategic profile, and the  new  leader's propensity  for and ability to make such alterations. The risk of  adverse selection arises because information asym-  metry between the board and successor candidates  makes it difficult for the board to accurately assess  if  the  abilities  of  a potential  successor match the  needs  of the firm. The board may select  someone  who is poorly suited to the job (Zajac, 1990).  Follower successors. Follower successors are in-  side executives who are promoted to CEO positions  following  the  ordinary retirements of their prede-  cessors.  As  insiders,  they  possess  firm-specific  knowledge  (Brady & Helmich,  1984). Further, be-  cause  of  their  frequent exposure  to  their  firms'  boards  of  directors and  other  senior  executives,  coupled  with  their history of performance inside  the firms, the risk of adverse selection is relatively  720  Academy of Management Journal  August  Therefore,  although  follower  successors'  firm-  specific  knowledge  and  the  relatively  low  risk  of  adverse  selection  they  pose  can  help  reduce  the  their  close  connec-  disruption  of  CEO succession,  tion  to  their  predecessors  and  social  networks  within  the  firm,  coupled  with  a likely  mandate  for  continuity  rather  than  change,  will  impede  their  initiating  significant  strategic  change  and  make  it  firm  difficult  for  them  to  significantly  operational  performance.  Given  this,  no hypothesis  is  proposed  regarding  the  performance  impact  of  follower  successors.  influence  low  (Zajac,  1990).  However,  follower  successors  have  significant  limitations  in  their  ability  to  initi-  ate strategic  change  because  they  are often  selected  and  groomed  by  the  outgoing  CEOs  (Cannella  &  Shen,  2001).  Incumbent  CEOs  often  believe  that  their  successors  should  be  similar  to  them  (Ham-  brick  et al.,  1993),  and  many  incumbents  do  select  such  successors  when  they  retire  (Levinson,  1974;  Zajac  & Westphal,  1996).  Because  of  their  close  connections  and  similarities  to  their  predecessors,  follower  successors  are heavily  influenced  and  so-  cialized  by their outgoing  CEOs and may  share with  them  the  same  or  similar  strategic  perspectives  (Fondas  & Wiersema,  1997).  They  are  also  signifi-  cantly  constrained  by  their  within-firm  social  net-  works  (Shleifer  & Summers,  1988).  Further,  CEO  successors  promoted  after  their  predecessors'  re-  tirements  typically  have  mandates  to maintain  stra-  tegic  continuity  rather  than  to  initiate  change  (Friedman  & Olk,  1995).  Contender  successors.  Contender  successors  are  inside  executives  who  are  promoted  to  CEO posi-  tions  after the  dismissals  of their predecessors.  Like  follower  successors,  contender  successors'  work  experiences  give  them  firm-specific  knowledge  (Brady  &  Helmich,  1984)  and  their  exposure  to  directors  and  other  senior  executives  reduces  the  risk of adverse  selection  (Zajac, 1990).  What distin-  guishes  contender  successors  from follower  succes-  sors  is  their  having  mandates  for change  from their  that  boards  of  directors  and  the  high  likelihood  they  will  be  able  to  initiate  and  implement  impor-  tant  changes.  Unlike  follower  successors,  who  are usually  se-  lected  and  groomed  by  the  outgoing  CEOs,  con-  tender  successors  are  promoted  after  successfully  challenging  their predecessors.  Because  power  con-  testation  and  CEO dismissal  often  occur  in  periods  of  poor  firm  performance  (Ocasio,  1994;  Puffer  &  successors  will  be  Weintrop,  1991),  contender  charged  to  initiate  strategic  change  and  improve  firm  performance.  CEO dismissal  is  a very  disrup-  tive  event,  and boards  of directors  are very  cautious  in  making  dismissal  decisions  (Alderfer,  1986;  their  predecessors  Lorsch  & MacIver,  1989).  In  order  to  gain  support  from directors,  contenders  for succession  must  con-  vince  them  that the incumbent  CEOs' competencies  are not  up  to  the  demands  of the  job and  that  they  (the  contenders)  have  different  strategic  perspec-  tives  and  can  perform  better  (Ocasio,  1994).  Fur-  ther,  contenders  may  not  only  have  board  support,  but  also  support  among  senior  executives  for their  power  contests  against  the  incumbent  CEOs (Van-  cil,  1987).  An  established  power  base  and  support  within  top  management  will  greatly  facilitate  the  process  of  taking  charge  (Gabarro,  1987).  Lastly,  contender  successors  do  not  have  to  be  concerned  in  initiating  about  offending  changes  because  their  predecessors  have  been  dis-  missed  and  have  terminated  all  association  with  the  firms  (Vancil,  1987).  Contender  successors  may  also  be  constrained  to  a  certain  degree  by  their  within-firm  social  networks,  but  demands  from the  boards  for change  initiatives  will  push  contenders  to  overcome  such  constraints  in  their  actions.  The  firm-specific  knowledge,  different  strategic  per-  spectives,  and  supportive  directors  and  executives  possessed  by  contender  successors  can  not  only  help  them  reduce  harmful  disruption  associated  with  CEO dismissal,  but also  enable  them  to formu-  late  and  implement  appropriate  strategic  changes  in  a timely  manner.  Thus,  we  expected  contender  successors  to have  a positive  impact  on subsequent  operational  performance.  Hypothesis  1.  Contender  successors  will  be  positively  associated  with  postsuccession  op-  erational  performance.  Outsider  successors.  Outsider  successors  are  most  often  selected  in  periods  of  poor  firm  perfor-  mance  and  when  directors  cannot  locate  a compe-  tent  successor  within  their  firms  (Finkelstein  &  Hambrick,  1996:  182-183).  Outsider  successors  are  prized  for their  fresh  perspectives  and  their  ability  to  initiate  strategic  change  (Helmich  &  Brown,  1972;  Kesner  &  Dalton,  1994;  Wiersema,  1995).  Also,  the popular  business  press  has advocated  out-  sider  succession  when  corporate  transformation  is  required  (e.g.,  BusinessWeek,  1997).  However,  past  research  has  reported  mixed  investor  reactions  to  outsider  succession,  and  little  is  known  about  its  (Kesner  &  Sebora,  1994:  long-term  355).  Although  the  objective  of outsider  succession  is  improved  firm  performance,  three  factors  work  against this  outcome.  First, outsider  successors  lack  firm-specific  knowledge.  Facing  mandates  to  turn  performance  around,  outsider  successors  are often  pressured  to  take  quick  action  (Friedman  & Saul,  1991).  However,  without  a  deep  understanding  of  their  new  firms'  internal  operations  and  external  implications  2002  Shen  and  Cannella  721  environments, it is difficult for outsider successors  to  quickly  formulate and  implement  appropriate  strategic changes (Gabarro, 1987; Kotter, 1982).  Second, it is more difficult for directors to fully  and accurately evaluate the capabilities of outside  candidates (compared with  inside  candidates) be-  cause  directors usually  do not have a deep famil-  iarity with them. This evaluation difficulty leads to  a higher risk of adverse selection  in  that a newly  appointed outsider successor may not  fit a firm's  strategic demands (Zajac, 1990). Finally,  outsider  successors often face the challenge of finding com-  petent  and  supportive  senior  executives  within  their new  firms (Friedman & Saul,  1991).  Senior  executives  have  often been  selected  by  outsiders'  predecessors  and  have  close  connections  with  them.  These  executives  are  often  hostile  toward  outside  successors  (Boeker  &  Goodstein,  1993;  Gouldner, 1954). Constrained by their experiences  and by hostility, these executives may have strong  commitments to their firms' past strategies and will  resist  any  significant  changes  initiated  by  the  outsider  successors  (Helmich  &  Brown,  1972;  Wiersema, 1995). Although the outsider successors  have the support of their boards, the lack of com-  petent and supportive executive teams when  they  take office puts them at a significant disadvantage.  Thus, despite their being appointed to turn around  performance,  we  expected  outsider  successors  to  often  have  negative  impacts  on  operational  performance.  Hypothesis 2. Outsider successors will be neg-  atively associated  with postsuccession  opera-  tional performance.  Postsuccession  Senior Executive Turnover  According  to  upper  echelons  theory,  a  firm's  strategies and performance are shaped by its entire  top  management  team  rather than  by  the  CEO  alone  (Hambrick & Mason,  1984).  We  expected  that personnel  changes in a top management team  following  CEO succession  would  have  a signifi-  cant  impact  on  firm  operational  performance.  Postsuccession  senior executive turnover has been  studied primarily as a consequence of CEO succes-  sion. Following a "strategic replacement" argument  (Gouldner, 1954), most previous studies  state that  postsuccession  senior executive turnover reflects a  new CEO's efforts to clear executive deadwood and  to  facilitate  strategic  reorientation  (Friedman &  Saul,  1991;  Helmich  & Brown,  1972;  Kesner  & Dal-  ton,  1994; Wiersema,  1995).  The underlying  logic  is  that because  executives  are constrained by  their  experiences (Hambrick & Mason, 1984), it is neces-  sary for new  CEOs to  replace  executives  whose  knowledge and skills have become obsolete in  or-  der to facilitate desired strategic changes (Keck &  Tushman, 1993; Wiersema & Bantel, 1993). Accord-  ing to this strategic replacement argument, postsuc-  cession  senior  executive  turnover will  positively  contribute to firm performance. However, there is  evidence  that  executive  turnover following  CEO  succession,  considered in  isolation,  has no  direct  impact on postsuccession  operational performance  (Virany et al., 1992).  Like successor selection,  senior executive  turn-  over in different succession contexts likely has dif-  ferent causes,  and thus  different impacts on  firm  operational performance. For example, much of the  senior executive  turnover after a follower succes-  sion  may  simply  consist  of  ordinary retirements  rather than dismissals initiated by the new CEO. In  other  situations,  some  executives  may  leave  be-  cause of their dissatisfaction with their firms' suc-  cession  decisions  or their desire to  pursue better  career opportunities. Further, the  succession  con-  text may even significantly moderate the impact of  senior executive turnover attributable to dismissal  on firm operational performance. Because succes-  sor  type  reflects  important characteristics of  the  succession  context, as pointed out earlier, we  dis-  cuss below how  successor type may influence the  nature of executive turnover and moderate the as-  sociation between postsuccession  senior executive  turnover and firm operational performance.  Senior executive  turnover after a follower  suc-  cession.  In a follower succession,  the retired CEO  exercises  a  strong influence  over  the  succession  process  (Lorsch & MacIver, 1989).  As  discussed  earlier, follower successors are usually  committed  to the retired CEOs' strategies and are unlikely  to  initiate significant organizational changes. In this  context, most senior executive departures are likely  to be ordinary retirements among top management  team members and to  reflect a well-planned  suc-  cession  process in  which  a new  top management  team smoothly succeeds the old one (Vancil, 1987).  This kind of senior executive turnover emphasizes  continuity of leadership and strategies, and it gen-  erally will  not  have  a  significant impact on  firm  performance (Friedman & Singh,  1989).  Even  if  there are cases in  which  senior executives  depart  for reasons other than ordinary retirement, the de-  partures are unlikely  to  affect firm performance.  For example, when  these  executives  quit because  they are passed over in the CEO succession tourna-  ment, their departures are probably expected  and  prepared for (Vancil, 1987). Further, dismissals  of  executives by follower successors often reflect the  successors' efforts to  consolidate  their leadership  722  Academy of Management Journal  August  initiate  rather  than  efforts  to  strategic  change  (Friedman  & Saul,  1991).  No matter which  scenario  unfolds,  senior  executive  turnover  in  a  follower  succession  context  is  unlikely  to  significantly  in-  fluence  firm  operational  performance.  Senior  executive  turnover  following  a  con-  tender  succession.  In  a  contender  succession,  se-  nior  executive  turnover  is  likely  to be greatly  influ-  enced  by  the  new  CEO's effort  to  initiate  strategic  change.  As  pointed  out  earlier,  contender  succes-  sors  have  garnered  support  from  directors  in  their  power  contests  with  their  predecessors,  and  they  are expected  to perform better than  their  dismissed  predecessors.  Under  the pressure  of improving  firm  performance,  contender  successors  will  be  very  prudent  in  assessing  the  capabilities  of their  senior  executive  teams  and restructuring  them  to suit their  new  strategies.  Those  executives  whose  capabili-  ties  and  loyalties  are  suited  to  the  predecessors'  strategies  will  be  removed  in  favor  of  those  more  suited  to  the  new  leaders'  strategies.  As  insiders,  contender  successors  are  familiar  with  both  the  existing  cadre  of  senior  executives  and  the  firms'  (Brady  &  Helmich,  competitive  1984).  Their  valuable  firm-specific  knowledge  can  help  them  reduce  the  risk  of making  poor  replace-  ment  decisions  and  help  them  identify  and  pro-  mote  executives  who  are competent  to  assist  them  to  accomplish  the  needed  strategic  change.  Thus,  turnover  following  a  contender  senior  executive  succession  will  have  a  positive  impact  on  opera-  tional  performance.  environments  turnover  following  Hypothesis  3.  Senior  executive  turnover  fol-  lowing  a  contender  succession  will  be  posi-  tively  associated  with  postsuccession  opera-  tional  performance.  Senior  executive  an  out-  sider  succession.  Like contenders,  outsider  succes-  sors  are  also  expected  to  initiate  strategic  change  and  turn  around  firm  performance.  However,  the  organizational  context  of  an  outsider  succession  is  significantly  different  from that of a contender  suc-  cession.  An  important  reason  for  outsider  succes-  sion  is the judgment  by directors  that no  competent  successor  candidate  is  available  within  their  firm  (Finkelstein  & Hambrick,  1996).  Indeed,  an  out-  sider  succession  often  signals  a loss  of control  for a  firm's  entire  top  management  team,  rather than  for  the  CEO alone  (Boeker  & Goodstein,  1993).  In this  situation,  tension  within  the  top  management  team  is  likely  to be high,  because  senior  executives  from  the  previous  regime  may  feel  inferior,  fearful,  or  even  hostile  toward  the  outsider  successor,  who  may  in  turn  question  the  competencies  of  these  senior  executives  (Gouldner,  1954).  Senior  execu-  tive  turnover  following  an  outsider  succession,  therefore,  is  likely  to be  initiated  either  by the  suc-  cessor,  to  restructure  the  top  management  team  (Helmich  & Brown,  1972;  Wiersema,  1995),  or by  the  senior  executives  themselves,  out  of  disap-  pointment  with  the  succession  decision  and/or  the  fear  of  dismissal  by  the  new  leader  (Friedman  &  Saul,  1991).  In  addition,  because  the  context  in-  volves  poor  firm performance  and  tension  with  the  outsider  successor,  some  executives  who  are well  suited  to  helping  the  outsider  successor  initiate  change  may  elect  to  jump  ship  for  better  career  opportunities  elsewhere  (Cannella,  Fraser,  & Lee,  1995).  Unlike  in  executive  senior  executive  in  a  contender  succession,  in  an  out-  sider  succession  turnover  will  be  detrimental  to  firm  performance  for  two  rea-  sons.  First,  it  further  increases  the  disruption  of  the  outsider  succession.  Although  disruption  in  an  outsider  succession  is  inevitable  and  neces-  sary  to  eliminate  the  influence  of  past  strategies,  a  certain  degree  of  stability  leader-  ship  is  beneficial  to  firm  operations  because  out-  sider  successors  need  time  to  accumulate  firm-  (Gabarro,  1987;  Kotter,  1982;  specific  knowledge  Virany  et  al.,  1992).  A  high  rate  of  senior  execu-  tive  turnover  after  an  outsider  succession,  espe-  cially  turnover  owing  to  the  executives  seeking  better  career  opportunities,  will  deprive  the  out-  sider  successor  of  some  managerial  talent  and  a  much-needed  transition  period.  Second,  unlike  contender  successors,  outsider  successors  are not  familiar  with  their  new  firms'  internal  and  exter-  nal  environments,  nor  do  they  know  their  senior  executives  well.  In  this  situation,  executive  re-  placement  decisions  they  make  very  early  in  their  tenures  may  not  always  meet  the  demands  of  their  competitive  environments,  and  some  valu-  able  executive  talent  may  be  lost  (Gabarro, 1987).  Indeed,  such  personnel  changes  may  arise  more  from  pressure  to  initiate  change  and  power  con-  solidation  than  from  a careful  assessment  of  stra-  tegic  contingencies  and  executive  competencies  (Gouldner,  1954).  Such  motivation  further  under-  mines  the  quality  of  the  outsider  successor's  ex-  ecutive  replacement  decisions.  Given  these  rea-  an  sons,  outsider  succession  to  have  a  nega-  tive  impact  on  firm  operational  performance.  senior  executive  is  expected  turnover  following  Hypothesis  4.  Senior  executive  turnover  fol-  lowing  an  outsider  succession  will  be  nega-  tively  associated  with  postsuccession  opera-  tional  performance.  2002  Shen  and  Cannella  723  Departing CEO Tenure  The length of a departing CEO's tenure is another  important  component  of  the  succession  context  and reflects the frequency of CEO succession  at a  firm. Departing CEO tenure influences postsucces-  sion  operational  performance through  organiza-  tional inertia and the disruption surrounding CEO  succession.  Hambrick and  Fukutomi  (1991)  pro-  posed that CEOs increase commitment to their stra-  tegic paradigms over their tenure in office. There is  empirical evidence that top executive tenure is di-  rectly  linked  to  top  management commitment to  the status quo (Hambrick et al., 1993) and strategic  persistence (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1990; Grimm  & Smith,  1991). Because strategies determine the  direction  of  capital  investment,  the  means  of  re-  source allocation within  a firm, and its  exchange  relations with  other firms (Porter, 1980), strategic  persistence implies  a strong continuity in the pat-  terns of these activities, all of which  are sources of  organizational inertia (Hannan & Freeman, 1984).  Strong inertia arising from a long-tenured CEO can  create serious problems for the  successor because  the strategies and structures developed  during the  departing CEO's tenure are probably no longer ap-  propriate. For example,  Miller  (1991)  reported a  decreased  fit  between  firm  strategies, structures,  and  environmental  demands  among  firms  with  long-tenured  CEOs. For  successors  who  adhere  to  their  predecessors'  strategies, negative  conse-  quences of the decreased fit are likely to arise. For  successors who  want to initiate strategic changes,  the strong organizational inertia developed  during  their predecessors' time in office will  increase the  difficulty  of, or may even  prevent, accomplishing  their goals. Thus, the exit of a long-tenured CEO is  likely to have a negative impact on postsuccession  operational performance.  However, a very short departing CEO tenure may  also be  detrimental to  postsuccession  firm opera-  tions.  When firms replace their CEOs frequently,  the new  leaders are often unable to establish reli-  able  and  accountable organizational routines  be-  cause  of the  disruption associated with  each suc-  cession event (Vancil, 1987). This lack of reliability  and accountability will  have a negative impact on  both inside  and outside stakeholders (Friedman &  Saul,  1991; Hannan & Freeman, 1984). Empirical  studies  have  consistently  reported that  frequent  CEO  succession  negatively  affects  firm  perfor-  mance (Kesner & Sebora, 1994). Further, short CEO  tenure often implies  that departing CEOs failed to  consolidate  their  leadership,  either because  they  lacked  the  needed  competencies  or because  the  situations  they  were  facing were  extremely diffi-  cult. The failure of these  CEOs drains away valu-  able resources and worsens the situation faced by  their successors (Grusky, 1963). Thus, like the exit  of a long-tenured CEO, the exit of a short-tenured  CEO will  also have a negative impact on postsuc-  cession  firm performance. Given this  pattern, we  propose  an  inverted  U-shaped  relationship  be-  tween  departing CEO tenure  and  postsuccession  firm operational performance.  Hypothesis  5.  There  will  be  an  inverted  U-shaped  relationship  between  departing  CEO tenure  and  postsuccession  operational  performance.  METHODS  Sample and Data Collection  The population for this study was large, publicly  traded U.S.  corporations. We  initially  selected  a  random sample of 300 public corporations report-  ing at least $200 million in sales for 1988. We then  gathered data on CEO succession  and senior exec-  utive  turnover for  each  year  from  1988  through  1994.  A  primary data source for CEO succession  and senior executive  turnover was  the  officer list  provided in  each firm's 10K reports to sharehold-  ers. Additional descriptive data on CEOs and their  successors were collected from Dun & Bradstreet's  Reference Book of Corporate Management and Dow  Jones Interactive's database, the Wall Street Journal  and News  Wires. Data on firm operational perfor-  mance,  size,  diversification  level,  and  industry  characteristics were collected  from COMPUSTAT.  Data on governance structure were collected  from  proxy  statements. Our final  sample  consisted  of  228 successions with complete data, including 159  follower  successions,  41  contender  successions,  and 28 outsider successions.  Measures  Dependent  variable:  Postsuccession  opera-  tional  performance.  As  pointed  out  earlier, our  study focused on the impact of CEO succession  on  firm  operational  performance. Return  on  assets  (ROA) was  selected  as the dependent variable be-  cause it is  a well-understood and widely  used  ac-  counting  measure  of  operational performance in  CEO succession  research (Zajac, 1990). We calcu-  lated each firm's ROA as income before extraordi-  nary items and discontinued operations divided by  net  assets as reported during each fiscal  year. To  fully  capture the  succession  effect and to  smooth  fluctuations in  ROA specific  to  a given  year, we  calculated postsuccession firm ROA as average firm  724  Academy of Management Journal  August  ROA during the first three years following the year  of CEO succession (e.g., Daily et al., 2000; Kesner &  Dalton,  1994).  Successor  type.  As  also  described above, there  are three types of successors-followers,  contend-  ers, and outsiders. A major challenge for this study  was to separate contenders and followers, as both  are insider successors. What differentiates them is  the cause of their predecessors' departure: follow-  ers are executives  promoted after an ordinary re-  tirement, whereas contenders are promoted after a  dismissal. It is difficult to identify CEO dismissals  because  firms seldom  fully  disclose  the  true rea-  sons  behind  CEO resignations  (Denis  & Denis,  1995; Fredrickson et  al.,  1988; Warner, Watts, &  Wruck,  1988;  Weisbach,  1988;  Wiersema,  1995).  Some previous research has relied upon CEO age to  separate dismissals  from retirements (e.g., Ocasio,  1994; Puffer & Weintrop, 1991). Researchers often  use  age 64  as a cutoff in  making these  decisions:  CEOs who left office before the age of 64 are treated  as dismissed,  and others, as retired. An  examina-  tion of our sample suggested that solely relying on  CEO age to make the decision  might be too crude  for  our  study.  Many  CEOs in  our  sample  relin-  quished the CEO title at the age of 62 or 63 but kept  the title of chairman of the board until the age of 64  or 65.  These  CEOs can  hardly be  treated as  dis-  missed  because  it  is  unreasonable to  keep  a  dis-  missed CEO as the chairman of the board, or even  as a director (Lorsch & MacIver, 1989). Indeed, the  observation described above may actually reflect an  ordinary relay  CEO succession  process  (Vancil,  1987).  Given that firms are unlikely to keep dismissed  CEOs on their boards, we  used both CEO age and  continued board membership to separate contend-  ers  from followers.  Further, we  checked  annual  reports, proxy statements, and the Wall Street Jour-  nal and News  Wires to exclude  from our analysis  CEO turnovers due  to  sudden  death  (12  cases),  health issues (2 cases), and taking a similar position  at another firm (9 cases). Contender successor was  coded  1 when  an executive who was currently an  officer of a firm was promoted to the CEO position  and the  departing CEO terminated his/her  service  as both the CEO and a director of the firm before the  age of 64, and it was coded  0 otherwise. Outsider  successor was coded 1 when an executive who was  not an employee of the focal firm was promoted to  the  CEO position,  and  coded  0  otherwise.  Fol-  lower  successors,  the  omitted  category  in  our  analysis,  included  all  noncontender  inside  suc-  cessors.  We  also  examined  news  reports to  bolster our  identification  of CEO dismissals  described above.  Contender  and  outsider  successors  identified  through news analysis composed a subset of those  identified in our above approach. We analyzed this  subset  of  contenders and  outsiders  and  obtained  essentially  the  same  result  as  those  reported  in  the next section,  which  are based on coding con-  tenders  and  outsiders  as  described  above.  The  alternative  results  are  available  from  the  first  author on request.  Senior executive turnover was  measured as the  proportion of officer turnover during the first two  years after CEO succession. We selected a two-year  period  to  fully  capture the  succession  effect  on  executive  turnover (Wagner et  al.,  1984)  and the  period normally required for a new  CEO to  fully  take charge in  a new  job (Gabarro, 1987; Vancil,  1987). We measured turnover among all executives  who were listed as officers in a firm's annual report  to  shareholders one year prior to the year of suc-  cession. Departing CEO tenure was measured as the  number of years an individual  had served as the  CEO of the firm from which  he or she was depart-  ing. To test for the inverted U-shaped relationship  hypothesized, we also included departing CEO ten-  ure squared in the analysis.  Control variables.  A number of factors, such as  firm size, governance structure, and industry envi-  ronment, may  influence  firm performance in  the  CEO succession  context through their impacts on  managerial  discretion  (Finkelstein  &  Hambrick,  1996).  To  control for the  influence  of  these  and  other important factors, we  included  nine  control  variables in our analysis. Like firm-specific knowl-  edge, industry experiences of CEO successors may  play an important role in firm performance (Datta &  Rajagopalan, 1998).  To  ensure  that  it  is  firm-  specific knowledge rather than industry experience  that  makes  performance differences  among  CEO  successors, we included a dummy variable, indus-  try outsider, as a control in  our analysis. Industry  outsider was  coded  1 when  a successor  had less  than two  years' industry experience  (at the  two-  digit SIC level) and 0 otherwise.  Presuccession firm ROA was included to control  the  potential  threat of  "regression to  the  mean"  (Brown, 1982) and was  measured as average firm  ROA over the last three years prior to the year of  CEO succession. Industry characteristics have been  proposed to have significant impacts on managerial  discretion (Finkelstein & Hambrick, 1996) and firm  performance (Dess, Ireland, & Hitt, 1990). To con-  trol  for  a  potential  industry  effect  (Tushman &  Rosenkopf, 1996), we  included  industry ROA and  instability in  the analysis. Industry ROA was  cal-  culated as the average industry ROA over the first  three years following the year of CEO succession at  2002  Shen  and  Cannella  725  a firm's primary two-digit SIC level. Industry insta-  bility was measured as the variance in  the indus-  try's four-firm sales  concentration ratio  over  the  first three years  following  CEO succession.  This  variable is similar to the one used by Wiersema and  Bantel (1993).  Diversification and  restructuring have  been  re-  ported to have a significant impact on firm perfor-  mance  (Hoskisson  &  Hitt,  1990;  Johnson,  1996).  Because  the  firms in  our  sample  varied  in  their  levels  of diversification, we  included  the  entropy  measure of diversification as a control variable. The  entropy measure has two  components: related di-  versification  (DR)  and  unrelated  diversification  (DU)  (Palepu,  1985).  The  two  components  were  calculated  for all  firms in  our sample. Following  Hoskisson and colleagues (Baysinger & Hoskisson,  1989;  Hoskisson,  Hitt,  Johnson,  & Moesel,  1993),  we  calculated  total  diversification by  summing a  firm's three-year average related and unrelated di-  versification  after  succession.  Restructuring was  calculated  as  decrease in  the  firm's level  of total  diversification in  the  three years prior to  succes-  sion. We included  this measure to control the po-  tential  influence  of  presuccession  corporate re-  structuring on  postsuccession  firm  performance  (Johnson,  1996).  Governance structure is an important factor in-  fluencing  succession  decisions  (Johnson, Hoskis-  son,  & Hitt, 1993; Weisbach,  1988) and firm sur-  vival  (Daily  & Dalton,  1994).  We  included  two  variables to control for the impact of governance  structure. Proportion of independent  outside  di-  rectors was  measured as the proportion of direc-  tors who  were  elected  to  a board before the  suc-  cessor  took  office  and  who  were  not  current or  past officers of the firm (Dalton, Daily, Ellstrand,  & Johnson,  1998).  Institutional  ownership  was  measured as the proportion of a firm's outstand-  ing  shares held  by  institutional  investors  in  the  year  of  succession  (Johnson  & Greening,  1999;  Smith, 1996). Lastly, firm size was controlled and  was  measured  as  the  natural  logarithm  of  the  firm's total sales.  Statistical Analysis  We  tested  our  hypotheses  using  hierarchical  multiple  regression. In a hierarchical multiple  re-  gression analysis, explanatory variables are entered  into the regression equation in a prespecified order  as  a  means  of  determining their  individual  and  joint contributions to explaining the outcome vari-  able (Tabachnick & Fidell,  1989). In our analysis,  we  first entered into  the  regression equation the  nine control variables. Following the time order of  their occurrence, we  entered the explanatory vari-  ables in the following order: departing CEO tenure  first, contender and  outsider successors  next,  se-  nior  executive  turnover and its  interactions with  contender and outsider successors  last. Although  our study emphasizes operational performance, we  also ran an analysis with market performance as a  dependent variable, measured as a firm's average  market-to-book value ratio in  the first three years  following  the succession.  The results suggest that  succession  does not importantly influence a firm's  long-term market performance. Because of our em-  phasis on operational performance, we  report this  analysis in the Appendix.

The hypothesis tests used OLS hierarchi-  cal  regression analysis  with  postsuccession  firm  ROA as  the  dependent  variable. The  results  are  reported in  Table  2.  Model  1  reports the  results  with  only the control variables included. Model 2  reports the results with  the  addition of  departing  CEO tenure, and model  3 reports the results with  the  addition  of  departing  CEO tenure  squared.  Model  4  reports the  results with  the  addition  of  contender and outsider successor. Models 5, 6, and  7  report the  results  with  the  addition  of  senior  executive  turnover and its  interactions with  con-  tender  and  outsider  successor,  respectively.  The  F-statistics for models  1 through 7 indicate strong  model significance (p <  .001). In addition, as indi-  cated by multiple  squared correlation coefficients  (R2s), all seven models explain a significant amount  of variance in postsuccession  firm ROA.  As shown in model 1 of Table 2, the nine control  variables account for a significant amount of vari-  firm  ROA  (R2 =  0.37,  p  <  ance  in  postsuccession  .001).  Presuccession  firm ROA (b =  0.77,  p  <  .001),  industry  ROA (b =  0.50,  p  <  .05), the  proportion  of  independent  outside  directors  (b  =  4.76,  p  <  .05),  (b  =  4.65,  p  <  .01)  and  institutional  ownership  display significant, positive associations with post-  succession  firm ROA.  The "main effect" of contender and outsider suc-  cessor on  postsuccession  firm operational perfor-  mance was tested in model 4. The addition of con-  tender and outsider successor into  the regression  equation significantly increases model 4's explan-  atory  power  over  model  3  (AR2 =  .02,  p  <  .001).  Hypothesis  1  predicts  a  positive  association  be-  tween  contender  successor  and  postsuccession  firm  performance. The  coefficient  for  contender  successor  is  positive,  but  not  significant  (b =  0.04,  n.s.). Thus, Hypothesis 1 is not supported. Hypoth-  esis 2 predicts a negative association between out-  sider  successor  and  postsuccession  operational  performance. The coefficient for outsider successor  is  negative  and  significant  (b  =  -2.65,  p  <  .01).  Thus,  Hypothesis  2  is  supported.  However,  as  shown in model 7, the impact of outsider successor  on firm ROA is  influenced by its interaction with  postsuccession  senior  executive  turnover. When  the interaction is included (model 7), outsider suc-  cessor displays a positive main effect (b =  3.85, p <  .05).

The effect of senior executive  turnover on  firm  ROA, both the main effect and the interaction with  successor type, were tested in models 5 through 7.  Although no  hypothesis  was  proposed, results in  model 5 suggest that senior executive turnover has  a negative main effect on postsuccession firm ROA  (AR2 =  .01, p  <  .05; b =-6.20,  p  <  .05). Hypothesis  3 predicts that senior executive turnover will  inter-  act  with  contender  successor  to  positively  affect  firm performance. With the inclusion  of the inter-  action in model 6 the variance explained increases  (AR2 =  .01, p  <  .10). The coefficient for the inter-  action is positive (b = 6.45, p <  .10). Thus, Hypoth-  esis 3 receives some support. Hypothesis 4 predicts  that  senior  executive  turnover will  interact with  outsider successor to negatively affect firm perfor-  mance.  With  the  inclusion  of  the  interaction in  model  7,  the  variance  explained  again increases  (AR2 =  .05, p <  .001). The coefficient for the inter-  action  is  negative  (b  =  -29.48,  p  <  .001). Thus,  Hypothesis 4 is strongly supported.  To facilitate interpretation, we plotted the inter-  action effect of successor type and senior executive  turnover on  postsuccession  firm ROA. Following  Aiken  and West (1991), we  calculated the  partial  derivative of firm ROA in the regression equation  with  respect to  contender successor  as  aY/aX1 =  -0.77  +  6.45Z and the  partial derivative of  firm  ROA with  respect  to  outsider  successor  as  aY/  aX2  =  3.85  -  29.48Z,  where  X1 is  contender  suc-  cessor, X2 is outsider successor, and Z is the level of  postsuccession  senior executive turnover. Figure 2  shows  the relationships between  senior executive  turnover and  firm ROA following  contender and  outsider successions  respectively, where the range  of senior executive  turnover is  from one  standard  deviation  below  the  sample  mean  (low:  0.17  -  0.11  =  0.06) to  one  standard deviation above the  sample mean (high: 0.17 +  0.11 =  0.28). The graph  clearly demonstrates that senior executive turnover  is  positively  associated with  firm ROA following  contender  succession  but  negatively  associated  with firm ROA following outsider succession.  The  slopes  of the  two  regression lines  further suggest  that senior executive  turnover has a more signifi-  cant impact on  firm ROA in  outsider succession  than in contender succession.  An important observation that can be made from  our analyses is that the main effect of postsucces-  sion  senior  executive  turnover on  firm ROA re-  mains negative and significant in model 6, when its  interaction with  contender successor  is  included  (b =  -7.77,  p <  .05), but it becomes insignificant in  model 7, when turnover's interaction with outsider  successor is controlled (b =  -1.06,  n.s.). Thus, the  negative main  effect of  senior  executive  turnover  on firm ROA may come primarily from senior ex-  ecutive turnover following outsider succession.  Hypothesis 5 predicts an inverted U-shaped re-  lationship between departing CEO tenure and post-  succession firm performance. Models 2 and 3 show  results of tests of this hypothesis.  In model  2, the  addition of departing CEO tenure does not signifi-  cantly increase the explanatory power (AR2 =  .00,  n.s.),  nor is  the  coefficient  significant  (b  =  0.05,  n.s.). However, with the addition of departing CEO  tenure squared, model  3  has  significantly  higher  explanatory power than model  1 (AR2 =  .01, p  <  .01). Further, the coefficient for departing CEO ten-  ure squared is negative and significant (b =  -0.01,  FIGURE 2  Interactive Effect of Successor Type and Postsuccession  Senior Executive Turnover on Firm ROA  3.0  -  2.0  1.0  -  0.0-  Firm ROA  -1.0 -  -2.0  -  -3.0  -  -4.0  -  -5.0  --  Contender  Successor  - - *-  -  Outsider  Successor  Low  Mean  High  Postsuccession Senior Executive Turnover  728  Academy  of Management  Journal  August  .05),  and  the  coefficient  p  <  for  departing  CEO  tenure  is  positive  and  significant  (b  =  0.28,  p  <  .05).  The  first-order  partial  derivative  of  firm  ROA  with  respect  to  departing  CEO  tenure  (aY/X  =  -0.02X  +  0.28)  suggests  that  in  our  sample  firm,  ROA  (Y) reaches  its  inflection  point  when  depart-  ing  CEO tenure  (X)  is  about  14  years  (X  =  0.28/  0.02  =  14; Cohen  & Cohen,  1983:  233).  Models  4-7  show  similar  results  and  suggest  that  the  inverted  U-shaped  relationship  between  departing  CEO ten-  firm  ROA holds  even  after  ure  and  postsuccession  successor  type, postsuccession  senior executive  turn-  over, and their interactions  have  been  controlled.  DISCUSSION  AND  CONCLUSION  In  this  study,  we  revisited  an  important  and  widely  studied  topic  in  management  research-the  performance  consequences  of  CEO  succession-  with  an  emphasis  on  the  importance  of  succession  context.  Building  on theories  of strategic  leadership  and  organizational  change,  we  simultaneously  ex-  amined  the performance  impacts  of three important  components  of  succession  context:  successor  type  categorized  at the  individual  level,  postsuccession  senior  executive  turnover  at  the  top  management  team  level,  and  succession  frequency  (as indicated  by  departing  CEO  tenure)  at  the  organizational  firm  ROA  used  as  the  level.  With  postsuccession  dependent  variable,  our  empirical  results  suggest  that  all  three  components  have  important  implica-  for  firms'  operational  performance.  This  tions  study  leads  us  to  four  general  conclusions  and  raises  several  interesting  and  important  questions  for future  research.  theory  First, the  evidence  supports  our proposition  that  to  rely  solely  on  firm  origin  to  divide  CEO succes-  sors into  insiders  and  outsiders  is to neglect  impor-  tant  differences  among  insider  successors.  Follow-  ing  a  power  circulation  (Ocasio,  1994;  Ocasio  & Kim,  1999),  we  distinguished  two  types  of  insider  successors,  contenders  and  followers,  on  left  the  posi-  the  basis  of  how  their  predecessors  tions  to  which  they  succeeded.  We  proposed  that  contenders  and  followers  differ  in  their  strategic  mandates  and  their  ability  to  initiate  strategic  change.  Although  the  results  did  not  support  our  hypothesis  regarding  a  positive  main  effect  of  a  successor  contender  (an insider  who  struggled  with  the  departing  CEO), they  do  support  our  argument  that  senior  executive  turnover  following  a  con-  impact  on  firm  tender  succession  has  a  positive  performance.  Further,  the  correlations  reported  in  Table  1  show  that  both  contender  and  outsider  successors  are  positively  correlated  with  postsuc-  cession  senior  executive  turnover,  which  has  been  used  as  an  indicator  of  strategic  change  in  earlier  studies  (Friedman  & Saul,  1991;  Helmich  & Brown,  1972).  These  findings  support  our proposition  that  contender  successors  importantly  differ  from  fol-  lower  successors,  though  both  are insiders.  One  of  our explanations  for our not finding  a main  effect  of  contender  successors  on  firm ROA is  that contend-  ers, though  they  differ from followers,  are still  con-  strained  by their  social  networks  within  their  firms  (Shleifer  & Summers,  1988).  Unless  they  can  re-  structure  their  top  management  teams,  they  will  not  be  able  to  improve  firm performance.  An  alter-  native  explanation  follows  the  power  perspective:  some  contender  successions  after  CEO  dismissal  may  reflect  the  outcome  of power  struggles  within  top management  rather than  an intention  to initiate  strategic  change  (Jackall,  1988;  Vancil,  1987).  Be-  cause  of  the  prestige  and  material  benefits  asso-  ciated  with  the  CEO title,  some  ambitious  senior  executives  may  challenge  an  incumbent  CEO  their  own  careers  (Lazear,  simply  con-  1989).  Because  tender  and  follower  successors  is  new  and  impor-  tant,  more  research  is  needed  regarding  the  ante-  cedents  and  consequences  of  these  two  types  of  insider  successors.  the  distinction  to  advance  between  Second,  our  study  clearly  demonstrates  that  fo-  cusing  on  a CEO successor  alone  without  consider-  ing  other  personnel  changes  within  top  manage-  ment  cannot  fully  and  accurately  capture  the  of  CEO  succession.  performance  consequences  Postsuccession  senior  executive  turnover  has  been  primarily  studied  as an outcome  of CEO succession  (Friedman  & Saul,  1991;  Helmich  & Brown,  1972).  Results  of  this  study  suggest  that  postsuccession  senior  executive  turnover  has  important  implica-  tions  for  firm  performance  and,  more  important,  that  the  direction  of its  impact  depends  on  succes-  sor  type.  We  found  that  senior  executive  turnover  has  a  positive  impact  on  firm  ROA  in  contender  succession,  but  a negative  impact  in  outsider  suc-  cession.  These  findings  not  only  highlight  the  importance  of  taking  a  top-management-team-  based  approach  when  studying  the  performance  impact  of  CEO succession,  but  also  suggest  that  there  are  different  patterns  of  top  management  in  contender,  outsider,  and  fol-  team  dynamics  lower  successions.  Although  we  conceptually  discussed  different  types  of  executive  turnover  (ordinary  retirement,  in  dismissal,  and  seeking  outside  opportunities)  it  is  beyond  the  scope  of  our  theory  development,  this  study  to examine  them  empirically.  A potential  direction  for future  research  is  to  study  the  pattern  turnover  in  con-  of  different  types  of  executive  tender,  outsider,  and follower  CEO successions  and  2002  Shen  and  Cannella  729  their  organizational  implications.  Further,  al-  though we  controlled for industry ROA and insta-  bility  in  our  analysis,  it  would  be  interesting to  consider whether these and other industry charac-  teristics, such as growth rate (Datta & Rajagopalan,  1998),  would  moderate  the  performance conse-  quences  of  postsuccession  senior  executive  turn-  over.  By  focusing  on  the  dynamics  of  entire top  management teams rather than on CEO successors  alone, researchers will  be able to gain a better un-  derstanding of  the  performance consequences  of  CEO succession.  An extension of the above proposition would be  to  examine  the  patterns and  performance conse-  quences  of changes  in  the boards of  directors in  contender,  follower,  and  outsider  successions.  CEO succession  certainly  influences  the  dynam-  ics  within  top  management  teams,  and  perhaps  also  the  composition  and  structure  of  boards  (Ward, Bishop,  & Sonnenfeld,  1999). Board com-  position  and  structure have  been  found  to  have  an  important  impact  on  corporate restructuring  and financial  performance (Daily & Dalton, 1994;  Goodstein  & Boeker, 1991; Johnson et al.,  1993).  In this  study, the proportion of independent  out-  side directors displayed  a consistent,  positive  im-  pact on postsuccession  firm ROA. Thus, it will  be  interesting  and  important  to  study  whether  the  three types  of CEO successions  proposed  in  this  study  have  different impacts  on board composi-  tion and structure and their subsequent organiza-  tional  implications.  In addition,  we  need  to  in-  vestigate  how  board  composition  and  structure  influence  the  occurrence  of  the  three  types  of  successions,  since  boards play  an important role  in  succession  decisions  (Johnson  et  al.,  1993;  Weisbach,  1988).  Third,  our  study  helps  to  clarify  some  of  the  confusion  surrounding the performance impact of  outsider  succession.  Successor  origin has  been  a  primary focus  in  previous  studies  of  the  perfor-  mance consequences of CEO succession,  and there  is  pressure from the  business  press  for  firms to  adopt  outsider  succession  (e.g.,  BusinessWeek,  1997). Earlier empirical evidence  has been  incon-  clusive regarding how outside successors influence  firm performance (Kesner & Sebora, 1994). Our re-  sults  show  that the  impact of outsider successors  on firm ROA is significantly influenced by postsuc-  cession  senior executive  turnover in that its main  effect changes from negative to  positive  when  its  negative interaction with senior executive turnover  is  controlled. This change suggests that the nega-  tive  impact of outsider succession  on  firm opera-  tional performance stems largely from a high level  of  postsuccession  senior  executive  turnover.  In  other words, outsider successors may be beneficial  to firm operations, but a subsequent loss  of senior  executives may outweigh any gains that come from  the outsider successors themselves.  Finally,  our  study  reveals  that,  in  addition  to  successor type and postsuccession senior executive  turnover, the tenure of departing CEOs importantly  influences  firm operational performance. We pro-  posed  that lengthy CEO tenures would  be  associ-  ated with  strong organizational inertia, leading to  difficulty when the successors wish to initiate stra-  tegic change. However, if a departing CEO's tenure  is  too  short,  the  firm  may  not  have  recovered  sufficiently  from the  disruption  of  the  previous  succession.  This  proposition  was  supported  by  the  inverted  U-shaped  relationship  between  de-  parting  CEO  tenure  and  postsuccession  firm  ROA. Although the impact of CEO tenure on firm  strategy and performance has been  examined  in  previous  research (Hambrick et al.,  1993; Miller,  1991;  Thomas,  Litschert,  & Ramaswamy,  1991),  our study demonstrates that this impact does not  disappear with  the  end  of the  CEO's tenure.  In-  stead, it extends  at least to the early years of the  successor's  tenure.  CEO tenure  has  also  been  found  to  significantly  influence  the  power  dy-  namics  within  top  management  (Boeker,  1992;  Ocasio,  1994).  As  an  extension,  it  would  be  in-  teresting to examine whether  departing CEO ten-  ure influences  successor type and postsuccession  senior  executive  turnover.  Limitations  The findings and implications of this study must be  considered in light of its limitations. A primary lim-  itation is that our study focused only on firms' oper-  ational  performance and  used  three-year average  ROA as an indicator. This measure, widely used in  succession research, only  captures the  operational  performance consequences of CEO succession in the  first three years after its occurrence and tells us noth-  ing about later performance. It is  possible that the  performance consequences of CEO succession, espe-  cially  outsider succession,  may  differ in  the  later  years of these CEOs' tenures. In addition, our findings  should not be generalized to firms' performance in  financial markets, because ROA and market valuation  reflect different aspects of firm performance (Daily et  al., 2000; Dalton et al., 1998).  A second limitation is that we used publicly ob-  servable managerial characteristics as  proxies  for  unobservable or hard-to-observe variables. Because  it is difficult to know the true causes of CEO turn-  over  (Denis  & Denis,  1995;  Weisbach,  1988),  in  our  measure of contender succession, we used CEO age  730  Academy of Management Journal  August  and continuing  as a board member  to infer whether  a CEO had  or had not been  dismissed.  Although  we  obtained  information  on  CEO departures  owing  to  death,  illness,  or outside  appointment  (these  causes  were  excluded),  our  measure  is  not  perfect.  For  example,  a CEO over  63 years  old  could  be fired.  In  this  situation,  our measure  would  wrongly  classify  an  inside  successor  as  a  follower  rather  than  a  contender.  On  the  other  hand,  a CEO less  than  64  years  old  could  voluntarily  retire from a firm with-  out  remaining  on  the  board.  In  this  situation,  our  measure  might  wrongly  classify  an  insider  succes-  sor  as  a contender  rather than  a  follower.  Our  ob-  servations  suggest  both  cases  are  rare,  but  such  misclassifications  would  reduce  our  ability  to  ac-  curately  detect  the  hypothesized  positive  perfor-  mance  impact  of contender  successors.  In addition,  our theory  linked  departing  CEO tenure  to  a firm's  commitment  to  maintaining  the  status  quo  and  or-  ganizational  inertia.  Although  strong  logical  argu-  ments,  empirical  evidence,  and  practical  concerns  limitations  of  justify  our  treatment,  given  the  demographic  approach  (e.g.,  Lawrence,  1997;  Priem,  Lyon,  & Dess,  1997),  the  rigor  of  our  study  would  have  been  further bolstered  if we  could  have  directly  measured  these  constructs.  the  Managerial  Implications  contender  its  Findings  from this  study  have two  important man-  agerial implications.  The  first concerns  top  manage-  ment  team  restructuring  following  contender  and  outsider  successions.  Facing tremendous  pressure to  initiate  strategic  change,  contenders  and  outsiders  may make restructuring top management  teams their  top  priority  (Helmich  &  Brown,  1972;  Wiersema,  1995).  Our  evidence  demonstrates  that  the  opera-  tional performance impact  of this  practice differs sig-  nificantly  for  contender  and  outsider  successions.  Whereas  postsuccession  senior  executive  turnover  was  found  to  improve  firm ROA among  companies  impact  experiencing  among  those  gaining  outsider  successors  was  nega-  tive, at least as measured for the first three years of the  outsider  successors'  tenure  with  firm  ROA  as  the  outcome  measure.  As  we  pointed  out  earlier,  this  result is mainly  a consequence  of the outsider succes-  sors' lack of firm-specific  knowledge  and the tremen-  dous  disruption  already  present  in  outsider  succes-  sion.  Thus,  we  advise  newly  appointed  outsider  CEOs to be prudent  when  making executive  replace-  ment  decisions  and to strive for some  executive  lead-  ership  stability  in  their  firms.  At  the  same  time,  boards may also need  to consider  giving  outside  suc-  cessors  more time  to smooth  the transition.  successions,  Second,  in  accordance  with  many  other  studies  the  14-year  inflection  point  (e.g.,  Vancil,  1987),  our  study  suggests  that  boards  of  directors  need  to  carefully  manage  CEO tenure.  for  the  Although  change  in  the  effect  of  departing  CEO tenure  on  firm  ROA  may  be  sample-specific  and  therefore  should  be  interpreted  cautiously,  the  inverted  U-  shaped  relationship  suggests  that  both  overly  long  and  overly  short  CEO tenures  are harmful  to  post-  firm  operational  performance.  Given  succession  this,  directors  need  to consider  how  long  their  can-  didates  should  serve  when  selecting  CEO succes-  sors.  Because  most  firms  have  age  65  as  a custom-  ary CEO retirement  age,  it  may  not  be  desirable  to  select  a successor  whose  age  is  near  or even  above  60.  Further,  if  a CEO is  appointed  very  young,  the  board  may  also  need  to  consider  replacing  this  individual  before mandatory  retirement  age, even  if  she  or he  is  very  successful.  At  the  very  least,  the  board  should  be  aware  of the  organizational  inertia  that  may  develop  during  a CEO's tenure.  REFER ENCES  Aiken, L. S.,  & West, S.  G. 1991.
