GEOFFREY LOVE MATTHEW KRAATZ University of Illinois The aim of this study is to illuminate reputational change processes and identify the underlying theoretical mechanisms. We draw upon extant literature to develop three distinct explanations for reputational change, respectively emphasizing criteria of organizational “character,” symbolic conformity, and technical efficacy. We evaluate these explanations by examining the reputational consequences of corporate downsiz- ing. Our results show that downsizing exerted a strong, negative effect on reputation, consistently with the character explanation. However, significant moderation of this negative effect by other factors, including stock market reaction and downsizing’s overall prevalence, indicates the need for a multitheoretical approach to reputational change. Corporate reputation is an important asset (or liability) bestowed upon a firm by external audi- ences (Fombrun, 1996). Observers form opinions that coalesce and adhere to organizations, affecting their future outcomes for better or worse (Roberts & Dowling, 2002). Much prior research has noted that these reputational ascriptions are enduring and “sticky” (Fombrun & Van Riel, 2004; Schultz, Mouritsen, & Gabrielsen, 2001). It is because of this stickiness that reputation (which can be defined as a subjective evaluation of a firm’s overall quality relative to its peers) is widely seen as a valuable resource (Fombrun, 1996; Roberts & Dowling, 2002). However, reputation, like other “stock” vari- ables, is amassed and depleted through temporal “flow” sequences. Audiences do tend to reproduce a firm’s reputation over time, yet they also change their evaluations, sometimes quite significantly. This study focuses on these changes and on firm actions that may precipitate them. In so doing, it seeks to identify the underlying mechanisms re- sponsible for reputational change. Because of the asset-like qualities of reputation, much theory has focused on its sociological or eco- nomic foundations, and empirical studies have We wish to thank Ruth Aguilera, Kevin Corley, David Deephouse, John Dencker, Don Lange, and Jim Westphal, as well as seminar participants at the University of Illi- nois and Purdue University, for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this study.

Relatively less work has addressed important and at least partially distinct theoretical questions about reputational ebbs and flows and the actions that may cause them (for exceptions, see Flanagan and O’Shaughnessy [2005], Staw and Ep- stein [2000], and Williams and Barrett [2000]). Im- portant issues also remain open on the “audience side” of reputational change processes. Although reputation is, in an important sense, possessed by an organization, the reality of reputational change reminds us that it must be granted by external audiences on an ongoing basis. However, prior re- search has provided incomplete and sometimes conflicting insights about what might lead people to change their opinions of a firm’s overall quality. It is known that audiences grant reputation in re- sponse to various “signals” that firms send, but it is not known which of the many (and sometimes con- flicting) signals that a firm conveys are the most likely to be received and to enhance or damage its existing reputation. The basic evaluative logic that people use in interpreting these signals and adjust- ing reputations is also not clearly understood. For instance, do they reward firms whose actions favor their parochial interests and values, or do they tend to apply more universalistic criteria? We believe that these issues are practically, as well as theoret- ically, important ones. Although constructing a good reputation is no doubt a critical strategic prob- Copyright of the Academy of Management, all rights reserved.

Thus, research that examines “reputational flows” identifies corporate actions that precipitate those flows, and probes the under- lying mechanisms responsible for reputational change can help provide such knowledge. In response to this perceived need, in this study we identify and examine three distinct explana- tions for reputational change. Each suggests that reputation granters tend to respond to particular signals and to employ a distinct evaluative logic as they encode a firm’s actions into its reputation. We distilled these explanations from three overarching perspectives that exist within the broader literature on reputation. One of these casts corporate reputa- tion as a reflection of organizational “character” (Davies et al., 2003; Dowling, 2001; Fombrun, 1996). A second emphasizes the importance of symbolic conformity with cultural expectations (Rao, 1994; Staw & Epstein, 2000). The third sug- gests that reputation is largely reducible to techni- cal efficacy concerns (e.g., financial performance) (Brown & Perry, 1994; Fryxell & Wang, 1994; Sha- piro, 1982, 1983). Although these three perspec- tives have been used primarily as accounts of rep- utation’s foundations (as is consistent with the central tendency in the literature), each also sug- gests a possible mechanism through which reputa- tional change may occur. We looked for evidence of these three proposed mechanisms by examining the reputational conse- quences of corporate downsizing among Fortune 100 firms throughout the period 1985–94. In par- ticular, we looked at how firms’ adoption of this practice affected their standing in Fortune’s “Most Admired Companies” rankings. This context is a particularly appropriate one in which to address the questions raised above, for at least three rea- sons. First, downsizing in the study period was a controversial practice that sent multiple and con- flicting signals to reputation-granting audiences. It conveyed, for instance, an obvious concern with efficiency and shareholder value creation. But it also signaled opportunism. Firms that violated commitments to employees might not be trusted to keep their commitments to other constituencies in the future. Both of these signals are highly conse- quential within the alternative accounts of reputa- tional change that we distill. Second, the audiences who ascribe Fortune reputations (stock analysts and peer firm executives) are known to share eco- nomic interests and cultural beliefs that distinguish them from other firm constituencies and may lead them to approve of downsizing firms. Their actual responses to the practice would thus provide valu- able insight into how (and how much) people’s parochial interests and beliefs color their reputa- tional judgments. Finally, we were able to examine downsizing in conjunction with other signals that also have strong and theoretically founded effects on reputational change. In particular, our analysis included powerful measures of contemporaneous change in firm performance and performance pros- pects (e.g., annual changes in profitability, changes in market capitalization, changes in analysts’ earn- ings forecasts). Including these measures allowed us to assess the degree to which downsizing’s ef- fects on reputation are distinct from those of per- formance change and to examine how downsizing interacted with performance factors in producing reputational change during the study period. In our study, we elaborate the three aforemen- tioned explanations for reputational change. Next, we use these three accounts in developing two sets of hypotheses about downsizing’s overall effect on reputation. Our first set of hypotheses (1a, 1b, and 1c) posits competing predictions about downsiz- ing’s main effect (positive, negative, null). These hypotheses are in one-to-one correspondence with the three theoretical explanations themselves. Our purpose in testing these hypotheses is to iden- tify the “dominant mechanism” most responsible for explaining downsizing’s reputational conse- quences. The second set of hypotheses identifies factors that may moderate downsizing’s main ef- fect, regardless of its direction or strength. Though reputation granters may be primarily attentive to a particular signal that downsizing sends, they may also respond to other, secondary signals that ac- company it and employ multiple evaluative logics in ascribing reputations. LITERATURE REVIEW AND THEORY Looking into the literature, we can identify at least three distinct perspectives on reputation. While these perspectives have been primarily de- veloped as accounts of reputation’s foundations (as is consistent with the core focus of the liter- ature), each can also be used to generate predic- tions about reputational change and the mecha- nisms through which it occurs. More specifically, these perspectives suggest distinct insights into the types of actions likely to enhance (or damage) reputations, the types of signals that reputation- granting audiences attend to, and the basic evalua- tive logic that audiences use in updating their repu- tational assessments. 316 Academy of Management Journal April Organizational Character One central theme in the reputation literature is the idea that audiences assign positive reputations to firms that appear to possess desirable character traits (Davies et al., 2003; Dowling, 2001; Fombrun, 1996; Fombrun & Van Riel, 2004; Markham, 1972). Two key premises appear to underlie this influen- tial account of reputation. The first is that people tend to anthropomorphize organizations (Davies et al., 2003; Dowling, 2001)—that is, they view organ- izations as coherent and purposive social entities (i.e., as conscious actors or “wholes”) rather than mere social aggregates or collectivities (Hamilton & Sherman, 1996; Whetten & Mackey, 2002). The sec- ond premise is that constituencies are especially concerned with organizations’ suitability as ex- change partners and thus tend to admire firms that appear to possess character traits such as trustwor- thiness and reliability (Fombrun, 1996). These traits are particularly valued because they provide a basis for predicting a firm’s future behavior (i.e., the likelihood that it will honor its obligations) (Fombrun, 1996; Fombrun & Van Riel, 2004). From this perspective, organizational actors that make clear commitments and uphold them over time are expected to garner admiration and reciprocal com- mitment. In contrast, firms that appear opportunis- tic or unreliable are expected to be less well re- puted. The idea that constituencies strongly value trustworthiness and reliability also figures promi- nently in several other literatures, including those on social exchange theory (Blau, 1964; Homans, 1958), the old institutionalism (Selznick, 1957, 1969), stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1984; Jones, 1995), organizational ecology (Hannan & Freeman, 1984), and game theory (Weigelt & Camerer, 1988). Microlevel research has also emphasized the posi- tive effects of displayed commitment and the neg- ative reactions that opportunism can provoke. Scholars have argued that individuals react to such displays at an emotional and preconscious level (Frank, 1988; Haidt, 2007; Hauser, 2006; Nesse, 2001). This perspective points to one specific mecha- nism through which reputations may change. Spe- cifically, it suggests that audiences will evaluate corporate actions as indicators of a firm’s underly- ing character. In other words, they will view ac- tions as occasions for attributing traits to the organ- ization and for revising their existing character attributions. Corporate actions that send signals re- garding the firm’s trustworthiness and credibility are likely to be particularly germane to these revi- sions. For example, when firms make critical deci- sions that are consistent with their espoused values and historical commitments, audiences should hold them in higher esteem. Conversely, corporate decisions perceived as connoting opportunism, un- reliability, or a lack of integrity should damage reputations to the extent that this “organizational character mechanism” drives reputational change.1 Symbolic Conformity A second perspective offers a very different way to think about the sources and dynamics of reputa- tion. In this view, reputational assessments are shaped by an organization’s symbolic conformity with external, socially constructed standards and categories that are less universal and more context- specific than those featured in the character per- spective (Rao, 1994; Staw & Epstein, 2000). Schol- ars employing a symbolic conformity perspective see organizations and evaluators as mutually em- bedded within larger cultural systems (Rao, 1994: 31). Accordingly, they come to share understand- ings and expectations about the structures and practices that are locally appropriate and culturally desirable. These shared understandings are thought to lead firms to adopt culturally correct practices and to affect constituent audiences’ evaluations as well. Specifically, audiences are expected to confer good reputations on firms that exemplify cultural stipulations and ideals and to penalize firms that fail to display appropriate symbols. From this perspective, an organization’s cultural fitness (rather than its apparent traits as a social actor) is the primary criterion for audience approval and esteem. This second perspective draws on neoinstitu- tional theory, which holds that organizations are situated within broader institutional environments and focuses especially on the cultural processes that operate within such environments (or “fields”) (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Meyer & Rowan, 1977; Scott, 2001). This perspective emphasizes that or- ganizations often adopt structures and practices in response to field-level pressures and suggests that 1 Importantly, this line of argument does not imply that corporate actions provide a window into a firm’s essential traits (or even that firms possess essential traits). Anthropomorphizing organizations may be an irra- tional approach to judgment, and audiences may fall victim to the fundamental “attribution error” in applying it (Ross, 1977). They may also read too much into actions that provide little indication of the firm’s real propensi- ties and predispositions (Ross, 1977; Winter & Uleman, 1984). The point here is that people tend to apply these criteria and to look for such traits, regardless of whether firms actually “possess” them. 2009 Love and Kraatz 317 they gain legitimacy and support in return for this conformity (Ruef & Scott, 1998; Tolbert & Zucker, 1983; Westphal, Gulati, & Shortell, 1997). Although the concepts of legitimacy and reputation cannot be equated, scholars have productively used this per- spective to study reputational processes (cf. Deep- house & Carter, 2005; King & Whetten, forthcoming; Rao, 1994; Staw & Epstein, 2000). A specific implication of this perspective is that audiences will evaluate corporate actions as sym- bolic indicators of a firm’s cultural fitness and ad- just their reputational assessments accordingly. A study by Staw and Epstein (2000) provides a com- pelling example of this proposed “symbolic confor- mity mechanism.” They found that firms enhanced their reputations by adopting various popular man- agement practices (e.g., total quality management, employee empowerment, and teams). They argued that this effect occurred because these practices embodied the normative values and cultural beliefs of the audiences who ascribed the reputations. In- terestingly, this reputational enhancement oc- curred even though the practices did not appear to improve corporate financial performance. Technical Efficacy A third distinct argument is that reputations are tightly coupled to consequences and tangible or- ganizational outputs. At the core of this view is the idea that reputation reflects a firm’s ability to fulfill evaluating audiences’ material needs. The perspec- tive thus leads to predictions that strong reputa- tions accrue to firms that, for example, produce superior products and services or deliver superior financial results (Shapiro, 1982, 1983). Within this view, firms are seen not as anthropomorphized so- cial actors or as inhabitants of a shared culture, but more as a means to audiences’ parochial ends. Em- pirical research showing that perceptions of prod- uct quality strongly affect consumers’ reputational assessments (Fombrun & Van Riel, 2004) has sup- ported this perspective. Studies showing that fi- nancial performance exerts a powerful (perhaps overwhelming) judg- ments made by stock analysts and peer executives (Brown & Perry, 1994; Fryxell & Wang, 1994) have provided even stronger support. influence on reputational This third perspective implies a “technical effi- cacy mechanism” that may account for reputational change. Specifically, it suggests that audiences will alter reputations in response to observed changes in valued organizational outputs. The direction and degree of reputational change should correspond with these performance changes. A “strong form” of this argument implies that reputational change their effectively reduces to performance change and that firm actions (such as downsizing) are actually epi- phenomenal to the process. In empirical terms, these actions’ reputational effects should be null once relevant, observable outcome changes are ad- equately accounted for. A “weak form” of this ar- gument is that actions may themselves affect repu- tation, but only because of (believed) implications for technical efficacy. This argument converges with the strong form in sharing the as- sumption that reputation granters are fundamen- tally concerned with performance, broadly defined. However, it also suggests that audiences are likely to view some firm actions as signals of expected future performance in their own right and to re- spond to them accordingly. As such, their reputa- tional judgments are expected to be more loosely coupled to the observable performance changes that either accompany or result from a given firm action.2 Table 1 summarizes these three accounts of reputational change.3 STUDY CONTEXT AND HYPOTHESES Downsizing has been defined as the intentional reduction of personnel in an effort to improve effi- ciency or effectiveness (Freeman & Cameron, 1993). Downsizing gained notice in the early 1980s as large U.S. industrial firms began to reduce person- nel in ways that were clearly distinct from tradi- tional practices such as furloughs and layoffs (Kiechel, 1985; Nielsen, 1985; Tomasko, 1987). His- torically, personnel reductions had been capacity- balancing actions most often taken in response to lowered demand during business downturns (Free- man & Cameron, 1993; McKinley, Mone, & Barker, 1998). Though such reductions often affected many employees, they were typically temporary and pre- dominantly affected production personnel at spe- 2 Although this weak-form technical efficacy argument is theoretically distinct, it becomes entangled with the other two mechanisms we have posited when we attempt to move it into the empirical realm. Audiences who are “ultimately” concerned with performance may still visi- bly react to displays of trustworthiness and/or symbolic conformity. 3 The reputation literature also describes other per- spectives and mechanisms, notably those that emphasize the quality of a firm’s external associations and those that suggest prominence and visibility are important components of reputation (Deephouse, 2000; Rindova et al., 2005). We have elaborated on the character, confor- mity, and efficacy perspectives because of their promi- nence in the literature and their direct relevance to our specific study context. 318 Academy of Management Journal April Summary of Different Accounts of Reputational Change TABLE 1 Mechanism Organizational Character Symbolic Conformity Technical Efficacy Basis of organizational Perceived trustworthiness and Conformity to cultural rules, Delivery of outputs valued by audiences appeal/esteem reliability. norms, and beliefs that exist at the field level.

In contrast, downsizing efforts often had a more strategic intent, aiming to “permanently” improve companywide efficiency and effectiveness through changes such as reducing bureaucracy and layers of management (Budros, 2002; McKinley et al., 1998). Many downsizings were of unprecedented scope and scale, involving thousands of employees, including managers (Bau- mol, Blinder, & Wolff, 2003). Although the downsizing trend started among heavy manufacturing firms, it subsequently spread widely and rapidly. By the beginning of our study period in 1985, downsizing had already been im- plemented in hundreds of firms (Nielsen, 1985), including 24 percent of the firms in our sample. By the end of the study period in 1994, most large firms reported that they had downsized at least once during the past five years (AMA, 1994). Over- all, the Fortune 100 firms we study downsized their workforces by millions of employees during the 1980s and 1990s (Nohria, Dyer, & Dalzell, 2002). Downsizing decisions were explained with refer- ence to a variety of specific circumstances and gen- eral logics. Notable among these were the need to respond to increasing global competition (Lamertz & Baum, 1998; Useem, 1993) and the accompany- ing characterization of large U.S. firms as “fat” and overstaffed (Thurow, 1986; Tomasko, 1987). Early downsizings were most often initiated in reaction to performance declines, but proactive downsiz- ings became common by the end of the 1980s (Budros, 2004; McKinley et al., 1998). Downsizing’s Overall Effects on Reputation: Competing Hypotheses Organizational character mechanism. The or- ganizational character explanation for reputational change suggests that audiences will view downsiz- ing as an occasion for trait attribution. The question they are likely to ask is what downsizing says about the character of a firm as a whole, particularly its trustworthiness and reliability. Downsizing should have a negative effect on reputational change, to the extent that this perspective’s proposed mechanism is dominant. By downsizing, firms broke commit- 2009 Love and Kraatz 319 ments and reneged on implicit “psychological con- tracts” with their employees (see Cappelli, Bassi, Katz, Knoke, Osterman, & Useem, 1997; De Meuse & Tornow, 1990; Heckscher, 1995; Noer, 1993). Though downsizing was perfectly legal and widely advocated as an efficient business practice, it con- noted opportunism and signaled that a firm was an untrustworthy actor that might not be counted on to meet its commitments in the future. Employees clearly interpreted downsizing as a betrayal and characterized downsizers as untrustworthy (see Brockner, Grover, Reed, DeWitt, & O’Malley, 1987; Gordon, 1996; New York Times, 1996; Noer, 1993). Many writers, critics, and politicians shared this interpretation and broadcast the same message (see De Meuse & Tornow, 1990; Gordon, 1996; New York Times, 1996). Downsizing also conveyed many other signals, of course, and it is possible that the analysts and peer executives who ascribed For- tune reputations were more responsive to those signals. Nonetheless, to the extent that organiza- tional character considerations drive people’s repu- tational evaluations, we should expect even these audiences to negatively react to downsizing firms. Analysts and executives were not personally be- trayed by downsizing, and they may have had little empathy with displaced employees, but a firm’s dealings with that particular constituency may have sent an important signal concerning its likely behavior in future dealings with them. There is also some empirical support for the proposition that downsizing might negatively affect reputation. Specifically, Flanagan and O’Shaughnessy (2005) showed that layoffs (rather than downsizings) had a negative effect on reputation, in an analysis of a different sample during a later time period than the one we examine here. We discuss their study in more detail below and also elaborate its differences from our own. Thus, we propose: Hypothesis 1a. Downsizing negatively affects a firm’s ascribed reputation. Symbolic conformity mechanism. If the sym- bolic conformity mechanism is dominant, reputa- tion-granting audiences will likely attend to differ- ent signals and thus respond quite differently to downsizing firms than they will if another mecha- nism is dominant. Specifically, they should evalu- ate the practice of downsizing on the basis of its consistency with their own cultural values and be- liefs, and they should reward downsizing firms to the extent that they conform with those sector- specific prescriptions (Staw & Epstein, 2000). This mechanism is also a plausible one, because down- sizing was deeply consistent with the expressed and revealed beliefs of the analysts and peer exec- utives who ascribe Fortune reputations. Downsiz- ing decisions were uniformly presented as efforts to improve the corporate bottom line, and it is known that these two audiences particularly value efficiency and financial performance. More im- portantly, members of these audiences vocally ad- vocated downsizing and publicly praised down- sizing firms during our study period (Kiechel, 1985; Useem, 1993). Analysts and institutional in- vestors were particularly vocal in their support, with some even pressuring corporate boards to re- place executives who resisted their entreaties to downsize (Nohria et al., 2002; Useem, 1993, 1996). Additionally, several prominent executives (nota- bly Jack Welch at General Electric and Al Dunlap at Scott Paper) publicly sang downsizing’s praises, por- traying it as crucial to improving large American firms’ competitiveness (see Tichy & Sherman, 1993). Popular models of corporate management that per- vaded American business culture during the 1985–94 study period appear to have further increased down- sizing’s symbolic value. In particular, the shareholder value model (Davis, Diekmann, & Tinsley, 1994; Jensen & Meckling, 1976; Useem, 1993) and the “lean and mean” model (cf. Budros, 2002; Kiechel, 1985; Peters & Waterman, 1982) both portrayed the practice as central to effective management in general, and to improved efficiency and effectiveness specifically. The former did so by emphasizing that downsizing, through reducing purportedly excessive managerial overhead, was an important technique used to align corporate staffing levels with shareholder interests (Thurow, 1986; Useem, 1993, 1996). The latter did so by suggesting that downsizing, as a core part of efforts to flatten the corporate pyramid and eliminate bu- reaucratic work, was a powerful means to the meta- phorically appealing end of a “healthy” and “lean” organization (Budros, 2002; McKinley et al., 1998). A final supporting indicator of downsizing’s cul- tural standing is its widespread (and growing) use during the study period. As noted, hundreds of firms (including 24 percent of our sample) had downsized at the outset of our study period (1985), and the vast majority of the sample downsized in the subsequent decade. The notion that the prevalence of a practice reflects its cultural appropriateness is widely ac- cepted in neoinstitutionalism, from which the sym- bolic conformity mechanism is drawn (Edelman, 1992; Tolbert & Zucker, 1983; Westphal et al., 1997). Indeed, previous research on downsizing itself has concluded that the practice acquired legitimacy as it spread (Lamertz & Baum, 1998; Love, 2000; McKinley et al., 1998). Although these prior studies have not specifically shown that downsizing firms gained in- creased approval by employing the practice, this pre- diction is quite consistent with their basic logic. It is 320 Academy of Management Journal April also consistent with prior research that has directly shown that firms can improve their reputations by adopting popular management practices (Staw & Ep- stein, 2000). Taken together, these diverse indicators provide powerful evidence concerning downsizing’s symbolic appropriateness within the particular cul- tural milieu of analysts and executives, despite the controversy that surrounded the practice in the broader popular discourse. To the extent that the symbolic conformity mechanism is dominant, we should thus expect downsizing to positively affect firm reputation: Hypothesis 1b. Downsizing positively affects a firm’s ascribed reputation. Technical efficacy mechanism. The technical efficacy explanation also provides insights into downsizing’s likely effects. The strong form of this account, which we articulated above, posits that reputational change effectively reduces to perfor- mance change. In other words, the argument is that downsizing has no independent effect on reputa- tional change after contemporaneous, observable measures of performance change are sufficiently accounted for. Buttressing this prediction is the argument of prior research that corporate reputa- tions (particularly Fortune reputations) are domi- nantly driven by financial performance (Brown & Perry, 1994; Fryxell & Wang, 1994). This research provides no obvious reason to predict that down- sizing and like actions would, in themselves, affect a firm’s reputation. Thus, we propose:4 Hypothesis 1c. Downsizing has no effect on a firm’s ascribed reputation, after contempora- neous performance changes are accounted for. Moderating Effects: Complementary Hypotheses Though tensions clearly exist between the three explanations we have posited, there is no reason to 4 The weak form of the technical efficacy argument might also be used to predict a direct effect of downsizing on reputational change. However, it is not possible to develop such a hypothesis without first making strong assumptions concerning the beliefs of audiences about downsizing’s technical efficacy (i.e., whether they be- lieve it is performance-enhancing or not). Developing a weak-form hypothesis also clearly requires one to as- sume that audiences look beyond available performance data in ascribing reputation. Thus, any hypothesis devel- oped from this argument would be significantly entan- gled with those flowing from the prior two perspectives. Therefore, we focus exclusively upon the strong form argument in testing the technical efficacy perspective. We reconsider the weak form as we interpret and discuss our results at the end of this article. presume a zero-sum relationship between them. Reputation granters may be primarily attentive to a particular signal that downsizing sends, yet they are also likely to respond to other, secondary sig- nals that accompany it and may employ multiple evaluative logics in ascribing reputations. With this in mind, we also develop hypotheses that explore the three mechanisms’ conjoint operation and seek to identify complementarities among them. The moderating effect of market reaction. Even if reputational change does not reduce to changes in technical efficacy, as Hypothesis 1c posits (that is, even if audiences respond to actions that signal trustworthiness and/or cultural conformity), there is still reason to predict that the technical efficacy of such actions will be consequential in determin- ing their reputational consequences. One particular performance measure that seems quite likely to moderate a downsizing’s reputational effect is the stock market’s initial reaction to it (i.e., the “excess returns” [Brown & Warner, 1985] associated with it). The reputation-granting audiences in our study are known to be highly attentive to the short-term movements in stock prices, and research has estab- lished that equity market valuations strongly influ- ence reputations in general (Brown & Perry, 1994; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). Thus, excess returns associated with downsizing may condition what- ever independent effects the practice has on repu- tation. Market reactions may be important moder- ators not only because they are an important outcome (i.e., because they create and destroy wealth), but also because they serve as a summary judgment of a firm’s decisions. In other words, the stock market may act as a sort of “information in- termediary” (Pollock & Rindova, 2003) that helps reputation-granting audiences interpret and evalu- ate various corporate actions. Hypothesis 2. Short-term market reaction to downsizing positively moderates its effects on a firm’s ascribed reputation. The moderating effect of recent firm perfor- mance. As we mentioned earlier, a salient and controversial feature of downsizing is that firms often cut personnel during good financial times (McKinley et al., 1998). If the organizational char- acter mechanism is operative, we should expect these “proactive” downsizings to be less well re- ceived (even if the character mechanism is not dominant overall). Firms that downsized without apparent financial need (for instance, while perfor- mance was improving) may have appeared to be particularly opportunistic and untrustworthy (Gor- don, 1996). In contrast, downsizing firms that were manifestly in trouble may have been partially ex- 2009 Love and Kraatz 321 empted from their implied commitments to their employees and thus less likely to incur reputa- tional damage. Declining performance may have made their obligations to financial constituencies more salient. Two observations made by corporate executives during the study period lend substantial plausibility to this prediction. One longtime Ford executive stated, “When you’ve just reported a $1.5 billion net loss, nobody wonders why you have to cut back.” In contrast, another executive noted that “the toughest thing to explain is why you see a need to trim your sails [i.e., downsize] when your markets are booming” (both quotations are from Fisher [1988: 42]). Research on organizational trust itself, which has shown that extenuating circum- stances can justify actions normally connoting op- portunism (Kramer & Tyler, 1996), also supports this hypothesis. Hypothesis 3. Recent changes in a firm’s per- formance negatively moderate downsizing’s ef- fects on the firm’s ascribed reputation. The moderating effect of prior reputation. An additional implication of the organizational char- acter perspective is that a firm’s prior reputation should affect audiences’ interpretations of its ac- tions. To the extent that good reputations are sticky and enduring assets amassed through a history of making and meeting commitments, we should ex- pect them to mitigate any reputational damage that downsizing may otherwise cause. People should be inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to firms with a record of “good behavior” and to be less quick to attribute opportunism on the basis of a single strategic decision. The same logic implies that marginal firms lacking a strong history of reli- ability may suffer greater reputational damage from downsizing. This prediction would not seem to follow from the conformity or efficacy perspec- tives, both of which cast reputation as somewhat more tightly coupled to recent signals and less af- fected by a particular firm’s historical pattern of behavior. Hypothesis 4. Prior reputation positively mod- erates downsizing’s effects on a firm’s ascribed reputation. The moderating effect of downsizing’s preva- lence. Downsizing’s growing cultural appropriate- ness may have also moderated its reputational con- sequences, even if the symbolic conformity mechanism did not dominate overall. Downsizing was not uncommon at the outset of our study, and it enjoyed significant cultural support even then (Kiechel, 1985; Love, 2000). However, the practice diffused widely and gained increasing cultural standing and acceptance across our study period (McKinley et al., 1998). The idea that a practice’s prevalence is a telling indicator of its symbolic appropriateness is well established in previous reputational scholarship (Staw & Epstein, 2000) and in the broader body of neoinstitutional re- search (cf. DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Tolbert & Zucker, 1983, 1996). Building on this logic, we would expect audience response to downsizing firms to become more favorable (or less negative) as a function of the practice’s increasing prevalence over time: Hypothesis 5. Downsizing’s prevalence posi- tively moderates its effects on a firm’s ascribed reputation. A close corollary of Hypothesis 5 is that down- sizing’s growing prevalence will make local perfor- mance contingencies less consequential as moder- ators of its reputational effects. As the practice spreads and acquires growing symbolic value, it should be seen as more universally appropriate, and audiences should attend less to the firm-spe- cific factors that initially justified its use (Tolbert & Zucker, 1983; Westphal et al., 1997). Therefore, the moderating effects discussed in Hypotheses 2 and 3 (stock market reaction and recent performance changes, respectively) should dissipate as the num- ber of sample firms that have previously downsized increases. Thus, we propose: Hypothesis 6. Downsizing’s prevalence weak- ens the moderating effects of the performance contingencies specified in Hypotheses 2 and 3. Cultural differences between audiences. Down- sizing’s reputational consequences may be moder- ated not only by cross-temporal variation in its cultural appropriateness, but also by cultural vari- ation across audiences. In the larger scheme, exec- utives and analysts are remarkably similar audi- ences (when compared with consumers, labor groups, the media, political organizations, aca- demic observers, etc.). They are clearly within the same field or cultural milieu. For this reason, it makes much sense to group them together, as we have done thus far and as other reputation re- searchers have also done (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Staw & Epstein, 2000). Nonetheless, these audience groups have potentially important cul- tural differences. We have noted that many analysts vocally advocated downsizing and even publicly celebrated downsizing firms. Although the practice also enjoyed cultural support from many prominent executives, there was much expressed ambivalence within this group (Nohria et al., 2002; Useem, 1996). Further, the financial community appeared to em- 322 Academy of Management Journal April brace the shareholder value model (which legiti- mated downsizing) more rapidly and unequivocally than managers (Useem, 1996). This was perhaps to be expected, given that analysts’ roles culturally consti- tute them as shareholder representatives (Zucker- man, 1999). In contrast, executives’ roles are much more complex; executives are simultaneously embed- ded in multiple institutional domains and must an- swer to both investors and a range of nonfinancial stakeholders. For these reasons, downsizing should be seen as a more unambiguously appropriate symbol from the cultural perspective of stock analysts. There- fore, analysts should react more positively (or less negatively) to the firms employing the practice: Hypothesis 7. Downsizing has a more positive (less negative) effect on a firm’s reputation as ascribed by stock analysts than on its reputa- tion as ascribed by peer firm executives. METHODS AND DATA Sample and Study Period Our sample was the 100 largest industrial firms in the United States as identified by Fortune. This sample is particularly appropriate because these highly visible firms are closely monitored by cor- porate audiences and were among those most af- fected by downsizing (Baumol et al., 2003). We sampled the Fortune 100 as of 1977 because this year clearly predated the start of the downsizing trend. We subsequently collected comprehensive data on all downsizings conducted by these firms through 1994. The Fortune survey “Most Admired Companies” was not initiated until 1983, and full data necessary for testing our hypotheses did not become available until 1985. Thus, our study ex- amines downsizing’s effects on reputation during the period 1985–94. This period incorporates much of downsizing’s diffusion. In 1985, 24 percent of our sample firms had downsized, and by 1994 over 70 percent had done so. Within this sample and time frame, the Fortune survey data were available for an average of 71 firms each year, and data for all variables was available for 616 firm-years.5 Our analytical approach, described below, enables us to treat the rankings of analysts and peer firm execu- tives independently within the same data set. Thus, our final data set contains two distinct observations in each firm-year, for a total of 1,232 observations. Theoretical Variables Dependent measure. We used the Fortune sur- vey, “Most Admired Companies,” to assess reputa- tional change. Fortune annually surveys several thousand securities analysts and executives who rate firms in the industries that they cover or work in. Respondents evaluate the ten largest firms in their industry on eight disparate dimen- sions. The dimensions are management quality, product quality, innovativeness, value as a long- term investment, financial soundness, ability to attract, develop, and retain personnel, community and environmental responsibility, and use of cor- porate assets. Fortune averages these eight items into a single reputation score for each firm and publishes these scores in their annual “most ad- mired companies” rankings. These rankings re- flect observers’ beliefs about a firm’s overall, sub- jective appeal relative to its peers, in keeping with the definition of reputation we use (Fom- brun, 1996). Although Fortune reputations do not capture the opinions of all relevant publics, the audiences who ascribe them are knowledgeable and influential ones. Much prior research has employed the Fortune survey in studying corpo- rate reputation (e.g., Brown & Perry, 1994; Fom- brun & Shanley, 1990; Roberts & Dowling, 2002; Staw & Epstein, 2000). Our theory takes explicit account of its known idiosyncrasies (for instance, the specific audiences it surveys and its well- known association with financial performance). Although prior research on Fortune reputations has focused on observers’ ratings of firms (raw scores), we used within-industry rankings of firms as our dependent measure. This approach is partic- ularly advantageous, given that Fortune-ascribed reputations are highly relational, as is the broader concept of reputation itself. In its annual reputation issue, Fortune uses firms’ raw reputation scores to create reputational hierarchies within industries. Further, the rating process itself also has a rela- tional character, in that respondents are only given the opportunity to rate comparable firms (i.e., the ten largest firms in a given industry). To facilitate interpretation, we created inverted ranking scores that range from 10 for the top-ranked firm in the industry in a particular year to 1 for the lowest. Thus, covariates that enhance reputation have pos- itive signs. Because of our interest in possible dif- ferences between audiences, we disaggregated an- alysts’ and executives’ rankings and included each group’s ranking as a separate observation. Given our core concern with reputational flows, we in- cluded the prior year’s ranking in all models. Con- sequently, the coefficients in our models reflect the independent variables’ effects on year-to-year repu- tational change. Independent variables. We constructed a di- chotomous indicator of downsizing, which is our main independent variable. Large publicly held 2009 Love and Kraatz 323 firms typically announce significant personnel re- ductions and describe their key features. Accord- ingly, we searched full-text articles of the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and several wire services for announcements of companywide per- sonnel reductions that aimed to improve efficiency or effectiveness, consistently with the definition and distinctive features of downsizing introduced earlier. To avoid including announcements affect- ing very small numbers of employees, we required that the personnel reductions affect at least 1 per- cent of employees.5 After applying this screen, we found qualifying downsizing events in 103 of the firm-years for which Fortune survey and other data were available. We subsequently dropped 12 events that were announced in December, as these appeared to have occurred after the annual (late autumn) Fortune survey. This procedure left us with 91 firm-years wherein downsizings were announced. All subsequent hypotheses (Hypotheses 2–7) pos- ited moderating relationships and were therefore tested using interaction terms. To assess whether short-term stock market reaction to downsizing mod- erated its effects on reputation (Hypothesis 2), we interacted the downsizing indicator with a measure of stock market reaction (“downsizing ⫻ stock mar- ket reaction”). We assessed market reactions using the standard excess market returns approach (Brown & Warner, 1985). This approach measures the change in a specific firm’s stock price, net of broader market movements, during a short window of a few days surrounding an event (here, the downsizing announcement). We constructed a be- ta-adjusted measure of excess returns as described by Brown and Warner (1985: 28), using data from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) and an 11-day event window (day ⫺5 to ⫹5) around a downsizing announcement. Excess re- turns measured across other windows (3 days and 1 day) produced similar results. To examine whether recent firm performance changes moderated downsizing’s effect on reputa- tion (Hypothesis 3), we interacted the downsizing indicator with a measure of change in profitability (“downsizing ⫻ profitability change”). We mea- 5 We operationalized downsizing dichotomously rather than continuously, as was consistent with our theoretical emphasis on the event as a discrete signal. However, we also estimated models in which we replaced the dichoto- mous downsizing indicator with a (logged) measure of a downsizing’s announced size. All hypotheses that received support in the analysis presented here also received sup- port in this alternative analysis (results are available from the authors upon request). sured change in profitability as the difference be- tween return on book assets in the downsizing year (t) and in the prior year (t ⫺ 1). Hypothesis 3 pre- dicts a negative coefficient based on the idea that declines in profitability would provide a justifica- tion for downsizing. It posits that increasing prof- itability would have the opposite effect, as observ- ers would see the practice as less necessary for financially healthy firms. Hypothesis 4 predicts that prior reputation would ameliorate downsizing’s effect on firm rep- utation. We tested this hypothesis with the interac- tion term “downsizing ⫻ prior ranking,” in which prior ranking is measured in the previous year. To aid interpretation, we centered the prior ranking variable before multiplying it by the downsizing indicator (Jaccard, Turrisi, & Wan, 1990). Note that we did not center the stock market reaction or profitability change variables, because their values (particularly their zero points) have substantive meaning, and because their means were already close to zero (Jaccard et al., 1990). To assess whether the prevalence of downsizing moderated its reputational consequences (Hypoth- esis 5), we constructed the interaction term “down- sizing ⫻ prevalence.” Prevalence is the percentage of firms in the sample that had downsized in prior years (including between 1977 and 1985). As with prior ranking, we centered this variable. To assess the corollaries of the prevalence hypothesis de- scribed in Hypothesis 6, we used triple interaction terms, “downsizing ⫻ profitability change ⫻ prev- alence” and “downsizing ⫻ stock market reac- tion ⫻ prevalence,” respectively. Hypothesis 6 pre- dicts that the moderating effects in Hypotheses 2 and 3 will dissipate as prevalence increases. There- fore, it predicts a positive coefficient for the first triple interaction term and a negative coefficient for the second. To assess whether analysts and executives re- sponded differently to downsizing firms (Hypothesis 7), we constructed an indicator variable, analysts. We multiplied this binary term by the downsizing indi- cator (for “downsizing ⫻ analysts”). Control Variables Prior ranking. Because of our central concern with how observers change their reputational rank- ings from one year to the next, we included a (cen- tered) prior year’s ranking in all models. This pro- cedure had the effect of specifying the model itself as one of reputational change. Contemporaneous performance change mea- sures. The strong form of the technical efficacy argument states that reputational change effectively 324 Academy of Management Journal April it reduces to performance change. This argument is the basis for Hypothesis 1c, which predicts that downsizing will have a null effect on reputational change after contemporaneous performance changes are adequately accounted for. To test Hypothesis 1c, we included three measures of contemporaneous per- formance change. The first measure, market capital- ization change t ⫺ 1 to t, captures changes in a firm’s total market valuation in the current year. More specifically, reflects the annual percentage change in the market value of equity and the book value of debt (t ⫺ 1 to t). The second measure, profitability change t ⫺ 1 to t, captures change in re- turn on assets between the current and the prior year. This variable is also the base term for the downsizing by profitability change term (Hypothesis 3). The third measure, earnings expectations change t ⫺ 1 to t, cap- tures changes in analysts’ estimates of the firm’s next fiscal year performance. We constructed this measure using the IBES (Institutional Broker’s Estimate Sys- tem) database. Using all earnings estimates provided by analysts during a specific year, we tallied the num- ber of upward revisions, subtracted the number of downward revisions, and divided the resulting num- ber by the total number of earnings estimates pro- vided. This measure varies between 1 (if all earnings estimates are upward revisions) and ⫺1 (if all esti- mates are downward revisions). Although changes in earnings expectations do not reflect performance per se, they are particularly meaningful because they re- flect analysts’ changing beliefs about a firm’s future technical efficacy and thus go beyond directly observ- able measures of current performance. Financial the- ory similarly suggests that changes in market capital- ization reflect future performance expectations, in addition to being outcomes in their own right. Performance change measures in the prior year. We included the same three measures of per- formance change for each prior year, on the as- sumption that changes in reputation may lag be- hind performance increases or decreases. These measures (market capitalization change t ⫺ 2 to t ⫺ 1, change in ROA t ⫺ 2 to t ⫺ 1, and earnings expecta- tions change t ⫺ 2 to t ⫺ 1) allowed us to account more completely for the effects of performance change in producing reputational change, as was necessary for testing Hypothesis 1c. Additional performance measures. We in- cluded three other performance measures that have been found to be important predictors of Fortune reputation in prior studies (Brown & Perry, 1994; Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). Specifically, we con- trolled for (1) average ROA for the current and two preceding years (average ROA three years), (2) av- erage sales growth over the same period (average sales growth three years), and (3) a logged measure of firm size (sales-based). Though these measures do not directly or exclusively capture performance change, we included them in order to provide the strongest possible test of Hypothesis 1c. A final control variable, announcement in prior December, is a dummy variable set equal to 1 for firm-years in which a firm had announced a down- sizing in the prior December. As noted above, we excluded December events from our downsizing indicator. ANALYSIS We used rank-ordered logistic regression analy- sis to test our hypotheses (see Allison & Christakis, 1994; Beggs, Cardell, & Hausman, 1981). This ana- lytic technique has two advantages. First, it is spe- cifically designed for situations such as ours, in which the dependent variable is raters’ relative ranking of objects within a group (firms in an in- dustry, in our case). We have explained the theo- retical advantages of focusing on rankings. The technique is also advantageous because it allows separate rankings from multiple raters (in our case, analyst and executive groups) to be incorporated into the same model. It has been used, for example, to explore multiple human resource managers’ rel- ative rankings of the same job candidates (vanBeek, Koopmans, & vanPraag, 1997), and to explain dif- ferent consumers’ relative rankings of competing products (e.g., Hausman & Ruud, 1987). Although we are confident of the appropriateness of this somewhat novel approach, its use presents some issues that require brief discussion. Since the dependent variable is a relative ranking within a group, variables that are invariant within groups (e.g., those that define the groups) are controlled for by construction. It is neither necessary nor possible to include such variables in rank-ordered logistic regres- sion models. In our analysis, a “group” is a particular industry, as assessed by a particular audience in a particular year (e.g., firms in the automobile industry, as assessed by analysts in 1987). Thus, all of our models implicitly control for industry, year, and rater. The result is quite similar to that occurring in fixed-effects models, wherein between-group vari- ance is “fixed” in the intercept term. The group struc- ture of the data has important implications for testing interactions in rank-ordered logistic regression mod- els. Specifically, base terms for some interactions can- not (and need not) be included because construction of the groups controls for them (see Allison and Christakis [1994] and Beggs et al. [1981] for further 2009 Love and Kraatz 325 discussion).6 Given the relative novelty of the rank- ordered logistic regression technique, we also tested our hypotheses using more conventional fixed-effect models. These models, which are presented in the Appendix, reveal substantively identical results. Because of the panel structure of our data, the possibility also exists that within-industry rankings for firms will not be independent across years. We compensated for this possibility by estimating stan- dard errors using the Huber-White sandwich (ro- bust) technique and by adjusting the standard er- rors for correlations within industry-year groups using STATA’s cluster option. RESULTS Table 2 presents descriptive statistics and corre- lations. Table 3 presents results from the rank- ordered logistic regressions. Model 1 of Table 3 examines downsizing’s main effect on reputational rankings. The downsizing coefficient in model 1 is significant (p ⬍ .001) and negative. Thus, Hypoth- esis 1a is supported. The ⫺.71 coefficient indicates that downsizing firms lost more than two-thirds of a position in the Fortune rankings, on average. This finding is clearly supportive of Hypothesis 1a and directly at odds with Hypothesis 1b (which pre- dicted a positive effect); its implications for Hypoth- esis 1c (which predicted a null effect, after contem- poraneous performance change is accounted for) requires more discussion. First, it is important to note that model 1 includes all the measures of contempo- raneous performance change that we described above (changes in market capitalization, profitability, and earnings expectations). We included these measures for both the current and prior year. Model 1 also includes other performance measures featured in prior reputation research. Our finding of a strong downsizing effect net of these factors casts serious doubt upon the argument that reputational change effectively reduces to performance change and upon the related idea that the audiences who ascribe For- tune reputations are single-mindedly concerned with financial outcomes. These findings also cast doubt upon the weak form of the technical efficacy argu- ment, though they cannot rule it out. It remains pos- 6 Consider the downsizing ⫻ analysts interaction used to test Hypothesis 7 as one example. Analysts does not vary within a given industry-rater-year group; it is always 1 or 0 for any such group. Thus, constructing the rank- ings implicitly controls for this variable, and its indepen- dent effect on rankings cannot be modeled. However, it is possible to examine its interactive effects because the downsizing ⫻ analysts term does vary within groups (as a result of variance in the downsizing variable itself). sible to argue that evaluators penalized downsizing firms because they believed downsizing would ulti- mately harm performance, or because they saw it as a signal of looming financial problems. However, changes in their beliefs about firms’ future perfor- mance prospects should have been well reflected in earnings expectations changes and stock price changes. This is particularly true for analysts.7 Models 2 through 6 in Table 3 test hypotheses subsequent to Hypothesis 1 by separately adding interaction terms to model 1. Model 2 examines whether stock market reaction to downsizing posi- tively moderated the practice’s main effect on firm reputation, as was posited in Hypothesis 2. The coefficient for the interaction of downsizing and stock market reaction is highly significant (p ⬍ .001) and positive, supporting Hypothesis 2. This moderating effect is substantial. A market reaction to a downsizing that is one standard deviation above the mean (⫹5.3%) is associated with a rank- ing loss of only 0.30, whereas a market reaction one standard deviation more negative than the mean (⫺8.6%) is associated with a much larger ranking loss of 1.11. The downsizing coefficient (⫺0.61) is the practice’s estimated main effect when the stock market reaction to the downsizing is zero. This coefficient is only slightly reduced from its ⫺0.71 value in model 1. Thus, although our test of Hy- pothesis 2 affirms the idea that downsizing’s tech- nical efficacy moderated its reputational conse- quences, it simultaneously provides further evidence that its effects cannot be reduced to performance concerns. Model 3 examines whether recent changes in a firm’s performance moderate downsizing’s 7 We conducted two additional analyses that also ad- dress the potential validity of the weak-form technical efficacy argument. First, we analyzed downsizing’s effect in the absence of performance controls and found a co- efficient of ⫺0.86. The relatively modest decrease in the size of this coefficient when financial controls are in- cluded (to ⫺0.71, as in model 1) suggests that perfor- mance factors did not dominate audiences’ evaluations of downsizing firms. Second, we ran supplementary models that controlled for a firm’s future (i.e., postdown- sizing) performance, in addition to prior and contempo- raneous performance. If downsizing firms as a group had relatively poor economic prospects that were not suffi- ciently accounted for by our other controls, we reasoned that these prospects would be realized in future years. We included measures of firm performance in each of the three years following the downsizing year and found that the main effect of downsizing remained essentially un- changed. This finding also undermines the idea that per- formance expectations can explain downsizing’s overall effect on reputation. 9 1 8 1 7 1 6 1 5 1 4 1 3 1 2 1 1 1 0 1 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 . d . s n a e M e l b a i r a V a s n o i t a l e r r o C d n a 2 E L B A T , s n o i t a i v e D d r a d n a t S , s n a e M 7 0 . ⫺ 3 0 . 8 0 . ⫺ 6 0 . 4 0 . 3 1 . ⫺ 9 0 . 0 0 . 3 0 . 5 2 . ⫺ 8 1 . 7 2 ⫺ . 1 0 . 1 0 ⫺ . 5 0 8 2 . . 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 ⫺ . . 1 2 ⫺ . 6 0 . 5 0 ⫺ . 4 9 6 3 2 7 . . . 2 0 2 0 7 5 1 4 2 . . . 5 0 0 ⫺ g n i k n a r y r t s u d n i -

The coefficient for the inter- action of downsizing with performance change is negative and highly significant (p ⬍ .001). This result strongly supports Hypothesis 3, which pre- dicted that reputation-granting audiences will eval- uate a downsizing firm less negatively if its recent performance was declining, and vice versa. The size of the coefficient indicates that a one standard deviation drop in ROA during the downsizing year (i.e., an ROA decline of 3.5%) is associated with a 0.42 (11.9 ⫻ 3.5%) reduction in downsizing’s im- pact on a firm’s ranking. This reduction is substan- tial—it is more than half the average ranking loss (0.71, from model 1) sustained by firms in our sample. Model 4 examines whether a firm’s prior reputa- tional ranking conditioned the main effect of down- sizing. The coefficient for this interactive term (downsizing ⫻ prior ranking) supports Hypothesis 4, which posited a positive moderating effect. Highly ranked firms experienced less reputational damage from downsizing. Each one-position in- crease in prior ranking was associated with a 0.23 reduction in ranking loss. Thus, a downsizing firm ranked two positions above the mean in its indus- try is predicted to experience a 0.25 loss in reputa- tion (0.71 ⫺ 0.46 ⫽ 0.25), and a firm ranked two positions below the mean will experience a 1.17 loss (0.71 ⫹ 0.46 ⫽ 1.17). The magnitude of this effect is considerable, and its direction is also note- worthy. The simple logic of regression to the mean might predict that high-ranked firms would expe- rience greater loss merely because they have further to fall. Model 4 does not support this prediction. Model 5 assesses whether downsizing’s prevalence moderated its reputational impact. The coefficient for the downsizing by prevalence term is both positive and significant, supporting Hypothesis 5. Downsiz- ing’s effects on corporate reputation became strik- ingly less negative as the practice spread over time, with the predicted ranking loss changing from ⫺1.33 (p ⬍ .001) in 1985 to only ⫺0.25 (n.s.) in 1994 (sig- nificance levels given are from similar models with the zero point of the prevalence term shifted to 1985 and 1994, respectively). Figure 1 presents a graphical representation of this shift. Model 6 tests Hypothesis 7, which predicts that analysts’ evaluations of downsizing firms will be more positive than those of executives. The coeffi- cient for the interaction of downsizing and analysts (⫺0.42) indicates that, contrary to prediction, ana- lysts’ reactions were more negative than execu- tives’ were. The downsizing coefficient in model 6 (at ⫺0.50) now represents the average postdown- sizing change in executives’ rankings (as they are the omitted class), whereas the average change in 2009 Love and Kraatz 329 Estimated Change in Industry Ranking after Downsizinga FIGURE 2 Year of Downsizing 85  86 87 88 89 90 91 92  93 94 Downsizing firm with recent profitability decline (80th percentile case: ROA  down 4.2%) Downsizing firm with recent profitability increase (20th percentile case: ROA  up 1.4%) Estimated Change in Ranking    0 –0.4 –0.8 –1.2 –1.6 –2 a Note that the ROA percentage amounts reflect the 80th and 20th percentile case of downsizing firm-years within the sample, rather than the sample as a whole. analysts’ rankings is the sum of the two coefficients (⫺0.42 ⫹ ⫺0.50 ⫽ ⫺0.92). It is necessary to be cautious in interpreting these results, however, as this effect was not hypothesized and as the ⫺0.42 coefficient is only marginally significant (p ⬍ .09 under the appropriate post hoc two-tailed test). However, given analysts’ vocal advocacy of down- sizing, the fact that they were marginally more neg- ative than executives is perhaps less important than the fact that they were negative, in general. Model 7 simultaneously incorporates the five in- teraction variables from models 2 through 6. The results change little when these interactions are simultaneously estimated. This model also serves as a baseline for models 8 and 9. These two models incorporate triple interaction terms as a test of Hy- pothesis 6’s prediction that the moderating effects of stock market reaction and recent firm perfor- mance changes will dissipate as downsizing grows more prevalent. Model 8 shows an insignificant coefficient for the downsizing by market reac- tion by prevalence term, indicating no support for Hypothesis 6 where stock market reaction is con- cerned. Audiences apparently continued to incor- porate stock market reactions into their evalua- tions, even as downsizing became widespread. However, model 9 shows a positive and significant coefficient for the triple interaction term downsiz- ing by profitablility change by prevalence, support- ing Hypothesis 6. Figure 2 graphically illustrates this finding. It shows that recent performance changes strongly moderated downsizing’s reputa- tional impact early in the study period, but had essentially no moderating effect by 1994, when downsizing had become widespread. DISCUSSION Our purpose in this study was threefold. We set out to examine reputational flows, to identify firm actions that precipitate them, and to elucidate the underlying theoretical mechanisms responsible for reputational change. We identified three prominent perspectives in previous research (reputation as character, as symbolic conformity, and as technical efficacy) and used them to develop distinct expla- nations for reputational change. Each of the three accounts offered its own insights about the types of actions likely to enhance or damage reputation, about the types of signals reputation-granting audi- ences attend to, and about the core evaluative logic they use in evaluating a firm and encoding its ac- tions into its reputation. We used these three ex- planations to develop both competing and comple- 330 Academy of Management Journal April mentary hypotheses about downsizing’s effects on reputation. Three competing hypotheses (Hypoth- eses 1a–1c) sought to identify the “dominant mech- anism” behind downsizing’s reputational conse- quences. In our subsequent integrative hypotheses, we posited moderating relationships and drew upon multiple theoretical explanations, working from the idea that audiences may attend to second- ary signals and employ multiple logics. Our study’s core finding is that downsizing ex- erted a significant, negative effect on year-to-year reputational change. Downsizing firms lost an av- erage of over two-thirds of a position (0.71) in in- traindustry rankings, net of all control variables. This core finding is strongly supportive of the char- acter explanation, according to which audiences highly value trustworthiness and respond nega- tively to opportunistic acts. At one level, this effect is not particularly surprising or noteworthy. The reputation-as-character perspective is well estab- lished in the literature and clearly leads to predic- tion of this result. However, this central finding is more remarkable when we observe it through the lens of the other two perspectives we elaborated. Downsizing fairly clearly signaled a lack of com- mitment to constituencies, but this was neither the only message it conveyed nor the most obviously relevant one. Similarly, although it is not theoreti- cally surprising that some people attributed oppor- tunism to downsizing firms, it is quite surprising that these particular evaluators appeared to do so. Downsizing enjoyed a very high level of symbolic appropriateness within the cultural milieu of ana- lysts and executives, and many prominent figures in this field explicitly advocated it. Nonetheless, members of this field lowered their opinions about the overall quality of the firms that adopted the practice. As our results show, this effect cannot be attributed to downsizings’ observable perfor- mance antecedents or consequences. It appears to be largely independent of performance factors. Our study’s overall pattern of results also sug- gests a theoretical contribution that belies the simplicity and intuitiveness of its main finding. Although analysts and executives clearly took char- acter into account in adjusting the reputations of downsizing firms, it was not the only signal they considered, and they did not weight it equally in all times and all cases. As Figure 1 shows, downsizing had a strongly negative effect at the outset of the study period: this effect almost completely dissi- pated by 1994. This large decrease in effect suggests that changing cultural norms may play a key role in determining what counts as an opportunistic act. Though downsizing never acquired the positive reputational valence posited under the symbolic conformity explanation, it did appear to shed its negative connotations as it became more and more ubiquitous. Proactive downsizings also appeared to become more acceptable over time, in keeping with the symbolic conformity logic of Hypothesis 6. Stock market reaction to downsizing events also strongly conditioned their effects on reputation. Downsizers with excess returns that were one stan- dard deviation above the mean lost only 0.30 places in their intraindustry rankings, on average. In contrast, those with excess returns one standard deviation below the mean lost an average of 1.11 positions. Downsizing’s increasing symbolic ap- propriateness did not mitigate this effect, contrary to Hypothesis 6. Thus, it is evident that our audi- ences did take downsizing’s technical efficacy into account, if only as a secondary criterion. This find- ing suggests that the reputational damage that results from violating commitments may be sub- stantially meliorated provided that the violation pro- duces valued results for evaluators. But it is impor- tant to note that this mitigation is far from complete. Controlling for market reaction only slightly reduces the main effect of downsizing on reputation. Further, negative performance consequences appear to exac- erbate reputational damage from opportunism. Our tests of moderating hypotheses also revealed additional support for the character account of reputational change. Notably, we found that proac- tive downsizings exerted a more negative effect on reputation, while declining performance mitigated damage. These findings are consistent with the character perspective, which suggests that violating commitments is more permissible in the presence of a clear need, but particularly problematic in its absence. Our finding that downsizing exerted less damage on highly reputed firms is also consistent with the character perspective, as articulated in the rationale for Hypothesis 4. Finally, the character perspective is also at least implicitly bolstered by the observed lack of support for Hypothesis 7, which posited that the idiosyncratic cultural be- liefs and parochial interests of analysts would cause them to react more favorably to downsizers. This finding seems to suggest that our two audi- ences applied similar logics and responded to the same signals.8 8 Arguments can also be made that analysts and exec- utives may attend to different signals and employ dis- tinct evaluative logics in ascribing reputations. For ex- ample, analysts may be more focused on financial outcomes than executives are. If so, the technical efficacy mechanism might be relatively more influential in shap- ing analysts’ reputational ascriptions, and the organiza- 2009 Love and Kraatz 331 It is necessary to give separate attention to the technical efficacy account in interpreting our study’s overall pattern of results. According to the strong form of this perspective, reputational change effectively reduces to performance change. This ar- gument implies that downsizing and other like ac- tions are themselves epiphenomenal. Their effects on reputation should be null, once observable mea- sures of performance change are accounted for. We believe our results very effectively refute this argu- ment. We found that downsizing exerted a strong and independent effect after we had controlled for the powerful measures of performance change dis- cussed above. The weak form of this argument is considerably more difficult to evaluate. It merely implies that audiences will respond positively to actions that they believe will enhance future performance. We neither claim nor aspire to refute this interpreta- tion; however, we do wish to make two important comments about it. First, it hinges on the notion that audiences have beliefs about the efficacy of particular practices that are, at least to some extent, independent of observable performance data. Sec- ond, it becomes deeply entangled with other expla- nations when one attempts to apply it empirically. The beliefs about the efficacy of a practice held by evaluators who are “ultimately concerned” with performance may form as a direct result of the cultural processes featured in the symbolic confor- mity perspective. Similarly, these evaluators may revile opportunistic firms because they believe they are likely to be bad investments or business partners. It is because of these complexities that we focused on the strong-form argument in developing our competing hypotheses. That argument has clear empirical implications that are readily separable from the other two. Some of our results might be interpreted as consistent with the weak-form expla- nation. However, we are reluctant to embrace the latter, because it says nothing about the ultimate source of beliefs regarding downsizing’s efficacy, tional character mechanism might be relatively less so. We did not develop hypotheses along these lines, in part because the rationales for them are somewhat inter- twined between the different theoretical perspectives. However, we did perform additional analyses to explore this issue empirically. We found that analysts and exec- utives were not differentially responsive to stock market reaction (Hypothesis 2) or to recent firm performance changes (Hypothesis 3) associated with downsizings. These (non-)results provide further evidence that the two audiences applied similar logics and responded to the same signals (analyses are available from the authors upon request). and because it makes assumptions about actors’ motivations that we cannot directly verify. Neither of the other two explanations denies that evaluators are concerned with technical efficacy. But they do not reduce reputational judgments to narrow self- interest, and they have the added advantage of pro- viding insights about why audiences might believe downsizing is or is not efficacious. Our study, clearly aimed at the reputation liter- ature, may also have some significant implications for the large literature on downsizing and person- nel reductions more generally. Several prior stud- ies have concluded that firms often downsized to gain financial constituents’ support (Useem, 1993, 1996) and have further emphasized that the prac- tice gained substantial legitimacy as it spread (Lamertz & Baum, 1998; McKinley et al., 1998). Our findings seem to introduce an interesting and ironic wrinkle into this account. Specifically, they suggest that while firms may have offered downsiz- ing as a symbol of their cultural conformity and propriety, it was typically received in a very differ- ent spirit. Flanagan and O’Shaugnessy’s (2005) re- cent study of the (negative) reputational effects of personnel reductions may provide further evidence of this irony. These authors studied a different sam- ple of firms over a later time period and focused on layoffs, rather than on the more specific phenom- ena of downsizing. Nonetheless, their results were similar in some basic ways to ours, further support- ing the idea that audiences may react negatively to actions undertaken with the apparent intention of winning their favor.9 Our study’s findings may be significantly context- bound. Downsizing was obviously a controversial practice and a somewhat unique one. Although other firm decisions may also evoke strong emotional re- 9 Flanagan and O’Shaughnessy (2005) did not explic- itly engage the institutional literature on downsizing’s diffusion and legitimation, and they also did not con- sider the reputation as character perspective that our study centrally features and supports. Rather, they of- fered an explanation that approximates the weak-form technical efficacy view. Specifically, they suggested that audiences responded negatively to layoffs because they believed that layoffs typically have negative performance results. It is also important to emphasize the critical distinction between downsizing and layoffs. We identi- fied over 1,000 layoff events in collecting data for this study. Fewer than 10 percent of these met our criteria for a downsizing (firmwide, permanent, affecting ⬎1 percent of employees, strategically oriented versus capacity bal- ancing). Our theoretical and empirical efforts have fo- cused specifically on this narrower category of events and would not apply to layoffs, in general. 332 Academy of Management Journal April sponses, it is likely that technical efficacy and sym- bolic conformity concerns play a more central role in determining the reputational consequences of many organizational actions. Future research might produc- tively examine how changes in corporate governance, mergers, new product launches, and/or the formation of strategic alliances affect reputational change. Such studies could shed further light upon reputational flows, the actions that precipitate them, and the mechanisms underlying reputational change. We be- lieve that our study may provide a useful method- ological and theoretical template for such research. It highlights the benefits of fully dynamic designs that examine the time-contingent effects of particular ac- tions. It also demonstrates the gains to be realized by bringing distinct perspectives on reputational change to bear in the effort to explain the effects of a given action. Future studies employing this template may substantially further reputation scholarship and help bridge the gap between reputation theory and related theoretical perspectives, most notably the institu- tional analysis of organizational legitimacy.

APPENDIX Alternative Analysis We conducted an alternative analysis in which the dependent variable was the raw Fortune ratings, rather than the intraindustry rankings that we used in our main analyses. We used the conventional fixed-effects modeling approach in these analyses. The models in- clude the same variables as the best-fitting model in Table 3 (model 9) and also include dummy variables for each year. We modeled executives’ and analysts’ ratings separately in models 1 and 2 and combined them into a single dependent variable in model 3. This combined score is the one that Fortune actually pub- lished for each firm. Accordingly, the n in all three models is 616, rather than the 1,232 in Table 3. The downsizing by analyst interaction is also omitted, as it cannot be estimated without separate observations for the two groups. All three models produce results very similar to the main analyses. All hypotheses that were supported in Table 3’s analyses receive at least marginally significant support in the first two models of Table A1. These same hypotheses were all supported at the p ⬍ .05 level in the third (published ratings) model. The striking similarities between the two sets of analyses provide strong evidence that the findings of our rank-ordered logistic regression models are robust. 2009 Love and Kraatz TABLE A1 335 Cross-Sectional Time Series Fixed-Effects Models of Influence of Downsizing on Fortune Reputational Ratingsa Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Variables Hypothesis Executives’ Ratings Only Analysts’ Ratings Only Combined (Published) Ratings 1 2 3 4 5 6 Downsizing Downsizing ⫻ stock market reaction Downsizing ⫻ profitability change Downsizing ⫻ prior ranking Downsizing ⫻ prevalence Downsizing ⫻ profitability change ⫻ prevalence Prior ranking Profitability change t ⫺ 1 to t Profitability change t ⫺ 2 to t ⫺ 1 Market capitalization change t ⫺ 1 to t Market capitalization change t ⫺ 2 to t ⫺ 1 Earnings expectation change t ⫺ 1 to t Earnings expectation change t ⫺ 2 to t ⫺ 1 Average ROA, 3 years Average sales growth, 3 years Firm size Announcement in prior December n ⫺0.18*** (0.04) 0.009** (0.005) ⫺2.31** (0.95) (0.04) 0.07* 0.46† (0.35) 16.6* (8.3) 0.66*** (0.03) 1.36** (0.52) ⫺0.14 (0.47) 0.17* (0.07) 0.27*** (0.06) 0.28* (0.11) 0.52*** (0.12) 2.48*** (0.57) (0.25) 0.31 ⫺0.19* (0.08) ⫺0.07 (0.10) 616 ⫺0.30*** (0.06) 0.010† (0.007) ⫺1.73† (1.33) (0.05) 0.12* (0.48) 0.81* 28.9** (11.4) 0.49*** (0.03) (0.71) 1.07 ⫺0.39 (0.64) 0.28** (0.10) 0.32*** (0.09) 0.81*** (0.16) 0.48*** (0.16) 2.84*** (0.77) (0.34) (0.11) (0.14) ⫺0.19 ⫺0.04† 0.17 ⫺0.21*** (0.04) 0.011** (0.005) ⫺2.27** (0.95) 0.20*** (0.05) (0.34) 0.74* 22.3** (8.1) 0.66*** (0.03) (0.51) 1.25* ⫺0.04 (0.46) 0.18** (0.07) 0.27*** (0.06) 0.48*** (0.11) 0.48*** (0.11) 2.28*** (0.56) (0.25) 0.06 ⫺0.15† (0.08) 0.04 (0.10) 616 616 a One-tailed tests where a hypothesis was made and the result was in the expected direction, two-tailed tests otherwise.
