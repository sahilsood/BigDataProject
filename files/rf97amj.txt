A RESOURCE-BASED PERSPECTIVE ON  CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE  AND PROFITABILITY  MICHAEL V. RUSSO  University of Oregon  PAUL A. FOUTS  Golden Gate University  Drawing on the resource-based view of the firm, we posited that envi-  ronmental performance and economic performance are positively  linked and that industry growth moderates the relationship, with the  returns to environmental performance higher in high-growth indus-  tries. We tested these hypotheses with an analysis of 243 firms over two  years, using independently developed environmental ratings. Results  indicate that "it pays to be green" and that this relationship strengthens  with industry growth. We conclude by highlighting the study's aca-  demic and managerial implications, making special reference to the  social issues in management literature.  Although the basic tenet of corporate social responsibility is that society  and business are tightly interwoven (Wood, 1991), scholars are still strug-  gling to specify the precise mechanisms linking firms and society. Within  this conversation, a central issue has been the economic impact on a firm of  its social policies. In this article, we focus on the economic impacts of  environmental performance, a specific social issue that has provoked a very  public debate. On the one hand, it has been forcefully argued that environ-  mental regulation enhances economic performance in an efficiency-  producing, innovation-stimulating symbiotic relationship (Gore, 1993; Por-  ter, 1991). On the other hand, regulations are assailed as generating costs that  businesses will never recover, representing financial diversions from vital  productive investments (Gingrich, 1995; Walley & Whitehead, 1994).  A number of empirical studies performed in this area have returned  differing verdicts. Several studies have shown no significant link between  measures of environmental performance and profitability (Fogler & Nutt,  1975; Rockness, Schlachter, & Rockness, 1986) or between environmental  performance and corporate disclosure practices (Freedman & Jaggi, 1982;  We wish to express our appreciation to the Franklin Research and Development Corpora-  tion for allowing us to use their proprietary database and to Roger Chope and Steven Matsunaga  for assistance with methodological issues. We also thank Thomas Dean, Neil Fargher, David  Levy, John Mahon, Alan Meyer, Peter Mills, Richard Mowday, and the anonymous reviewers for  helpful comments.  534 This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1997 Russo and Fouts 535  Wiseman, 1982). But other studies have shown that better pollution perfor-  mance improved profitability (Bragdon & Marlin, 1972; Spicer, 1978a) and  reduced risks (Spicer, 1978b) and that federal compliance liability costs and  profitability were negatively related (Holman, New, & Singer, 1985). One can  challenge these prior studies on methodological grounds. All but one used  small, single-industry samples. More importantly, they have frequently re-  lied on self-reported data, failed to control for other predictors of profitabil-  ity, and used questionable social responsibility measures (Wood & Jones,  1995). These methodological shortcomings may be responsible for results to  date that have shown an equivocal relationship between environmental per-  formance and economic performance.1  Wood and Jones (1995) argued that this inconclusiveness is primarily  due to a key conceptual shortcoming, failure to carefully trace how the social  policies examined directly influence firms' bottom lines. For example, we  would expect that any external imposition of fines or additional compliance  costs would drive down profits, thus accounting for the significant effects of  these costs found in several of the studies just cited. We agree with Wood  and Jones that there are conceptual flaws in prior research, but we also  suggest that the relationship is more complex than a simple calculus equat-  ing higher costs with lower profits. After all, if the sole driving force for a  corporate environmental policy is minimizing tangible pollution costs, then  any firm going beyond compliance would forfeit the profits it could gain  from simply (and legally) continuing to externalize those costs. Our argu-  ment, based on the resource-based view of the firm, highlights the role en-  vironmental policy plays in generating broader organizational advantages  that allow a firm to capture premium profits. In a sense, it could be said that  the same policies that internalize negative environmental spillovers can pay  off by simultaneously generating greater positive organizational spillovers  that accrue internally and privately to the firm. Thus, for both methodologi-  cal and conceptual reasons, a careful study of the relationship between en-  vironmental performance and economic performance is both timely and  potentially of great value.  The resource-based view of the firm offers corporate social responsibil-  ity researchers a tool for refining the analysis of how corporate social policy  influences the bottom line for two reasons. First, the resource-based view has  a strong focus on performance as the key outcome variable. And second, like  the social responsibility literature, work adopting the resource-based view  explicitly recognizes the importance of intangible concepts, such as know-  how (Teece, 1980), corporate culture (Barney, 1986), and reputation (Hall,  1992). These theoretical complementarities offer a significant opportunity  1 Two working papers (Hart & Ahuja, 1994; Cohen, Fenn, & Naimon, 1995) have also  addressed the environment-performance relationship, with mixed results. The equivocality of  results in this area extends to other social issues, such as corporate philanthropy and commu-  nity relations. Ullman (1985), Aupperle, Carroll, and Hatfield (1985), and most recently, Wood  and Jones (1995) have offered surveys of empirical work in this area.

Further, we explored in-  dustry growth as a moderator of this relationship, theorizing that firms are  less likely to reap benefits from increased environmental performance when  industry growth is low. But before formally stating these predictions, we  briefly outline the resource-based theory of competitive advantage.  A RESOURCE-BASED VIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE  AND ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE  The Resource-Based View of Competitive Advantage  The resource-based view of the firm grew out of a frustration with the  structure-conduct-performance paradigm of the industrial organization (IO)  view of the firm (Bain, 1959; Porter, 1980). The early resource-based theo-  rists found the IO view-that a firm's success was wholly determined by its  external environment-to be unrealistically limited and turned to the semi-  nal work of Penrose (1959) for motivation. To counter the IO view, Werner-  felt (1984), Dierickx and Cool (1989), and Prahalad and Hamel (1990) built  resource-based theory around the internal competencies of firms. In these  contributions to resource-based theory, competitive advantage is rooted in-  side a firm, in assets that are valuable and inimitable. A firm's capabilities or  competencies and management's abilities to marshal these assets to produce  superior performance determine competitive advantage (Grant, 1991). In the  drive to add depth and breadth to this internal view, theorists have noted but  left somewhat vague the role of a firm's links to its external environment.  Barney's (1986) work addressed this issue by pinpointing the conditions  under which a firm's resources become valuable by bringing the external  environment into the resource-based picture. In developing the notion of  external factor markets, he noted that, contrary to the IO model, external  resource analysis alone cannot lead to valuable resources. However, by nur-  turing internal competencies and applying them to an appropriate external  environment, a firm can develop a viable strategy. Thus, for a firm's resource  to become valuable, it must allow the firm to "exploit opportunities or neu-  tralize threats" in the firm's environment (Barney, 1991: 106). The link in  resource-based theory between the competitive environment and firm capa-  bilities was made more explicit by Conner (1991), in her comparison of the  resource-based view and the IO and Chicago models. She observed that all  three recognize the external constraints of demand conditions and public  policy on strategy. For Conner, the task for resource-based theorists is to  discern the appropriate rent-generating inputs given both external (e.g., de-  mand, public policy, and competitor action) and internal (e.g., past history,  resource endowments, and corporate culture) constraints.  Thus, in its current state, the resource-based view addresses the fit be-  tween what a firm has the ability to do and what it has the opportunity to do.  To quote Collis and Montgomery, "Resources cannot be evaluated in isola-  tion, because their value is determined in the interplay with market forces.

In the resource-based view, resources are classified as tangible, intan-  gible, and personnel-based (Grant, 1991). Tangible resources include finan-  cial reserves and physical resources such as plant, equipment, and stocks  of raw materials. Intangible resources include reputation, technology, and  human resources; the latter include culture, the training and expertise of  employees, and their commitment and loyalty. As these resources are not  productive on their own, the analysis also needs to consider a firm's organ-  izational capabilities-its abilities to assemble, integrate, and manage these  bundles of resources. In our application of the resource-based view, we  considered resources and capabilities in the following combinations: (1)  physical assets and the technologies and skills required to use them, (2)  human resources and organizational capabilities, which include culture,  commitment, and capabilities for integration and communication, and (3)  the intangible resources of reputation and political acumen.  Previous applications of resource-based theory to evaluation of environ-  mental policies and strategy have concentrated on internal analysis of firms  (Porter, 1991; Shrivastava, 1995a). However, Hart (1995) expanded the re-  source-based view of the firm to include the constraints imposed and op-  portunities offered by the biophysical environment. In his theory, he pro-  vided a schema that links the imperative of capturing a competitive advan-  tage with the goal of securing and enhancing social legitimacy. He viewed  external stakeholders as playing a pivotal role in moving corporations to-  ward sustainability. The logical extension of this argument is that viewing  societal demands as part of the external environment facing a firm trying to  develop unique resources leads to expectations about when such resources  will be valuable and inimitable. We suggest this is particularly true when  society is demanding a cleaner environment.  In developing our theory, we found it useful to bear in mind two modes  of environmental policy advanced by Hart (1995). The first is the compliance  strategy, wherein firms rely on pollution abatement through a short-term,  "end-of-pipe" approach, often resisting the enactment and enforcement of  environmental legislation. Firms often fall short of compliance in this mode.  The second mode of environmental policy is going beyond compliance to a  focus on prevention, a systemic approach that emphasizes source reduction  and process innovation (Hart, 1995). Our position is that firms that tend  toward the compliance mode will differ in their resource bases from those  that tend toward prevention and that this policy choice will affect firms'  ability to generate profits.  Corporate Environmental Performance and Profitability  Physical assets and technology. The resources and capabilities required  to implement a firm's environmental policy vary radically, depending on  whether or not that firm goes beyond compliance to embrace pollution pre- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  538 Academy of Management Journal June  vention. End-of-pipe compliance policies affect only physical asset re-  sources, which consist of the "physical technology used in a firm, a firm's  plant and equipment, its geographic location, and its access to raw materi-  als" (Barney, 1991). Compliance is achieved primarily by the addition of  pollution-removing or filtering devices to the existing assets of a firm and  does not require the firm to develop expertise or skills in managing new  environmental technologies or processes. The technology is essentially self-  contained, off-the-shelf hardware. Once such hardware is installed, it does  not fundamentally vary production or service delivery processes. Thus, the  implementation of this policy is straightforward and leaves a firm essentially  in the same resource and capability situation it was in before it adopted the  policy (Groenewegen & Vergragt, 1991; Kemp, 1993).  As a proactive environmental policy takes hold in a firm, we would  expect it to redesign its production or service delivery processes. Such a  redesign would likely involve the acquisition and installation of new tech-  nologies. Within this schema, the resource-based view of the firm provides  a solid foundation for the hypothesis that improved environmental perfor-  mance can enhance economic performance. Physical resources can be a  source of competitive advantage if they "outperform" equivalent assets  within competitors. The resource-based prediction would be that, if pur-  chased from a third party, a physical asset itself cannot produce premium  profits, as that technology is presumably available to competitors. However,  if new physical assets are deployed in a way that allows a firm to capitalize  on and enhance its internal methods for waste reduction and operational and  fuel efficiency, such advantages are less transparent. And this method of  deployment is likely to be the case within firms stressing prevention. Indeed,  these internal routines represent the type of causally ambiguous resource  (Reed & DeFillippi, 1990) that is central to the resource-based view of com-  petitive advantage. When internal routines and know-how accumulate, a  firm's knowledge of pollution prevention deepens (Dean & Brown, 1995).  Such knowledge lessens the risk of spills and other actionable offenses tak-  ing place (Groenewegen & Vergragt, 1991; Shrivastava, 1995a).  Human resources and organizational capabilities. Embracing the no-  tion of improved environmental performance also requires a fundamental  shift in a firm's culture and human resources and the organizational capa-  bilities required to manage them. Management, R&D, production, and mar-  keting all must be involved and committed if a firm is to implement a policy  of using clean technologies (Ashford, 1993; Hart, 1995). Use of clean tech-  nologies also adds complexity to production or delivery processes and re-  quires increased skills from workers at all levels of the firm (Groenewegen &  Vergragt, 1991). So prevention is a more comprehensive and socially com-  plex process than compliance, necessitating significant employee involve-  ment, cross-disciplinary coordination and integration, and a forward-  thinking managerial style (Shrivastava, 1995b). For example, Hart (1995:  996) discussed Xerox's policy of viewing its leased copiers as a source of  high-quality inputs for its new copiers. Such a policy ties together design This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1997 Russo and Fouts 539  and manufacturing functions, along with those units responsible for inter-  faces with customers, resulting in company-wide gains. The process of de-  veloping a pollution prevention policy thus builds within a firm the re-  sources of organizational commitment and learning, cross-functional inte-  gration, and increased employee skills and participation, which, we argue,  are emerging as prime resources in the modern competitive environment.  A strong environmental stance can be expected to become part of an  organization's image and identity and to guide the actions of its members  (Dutton & Dukerich, 1991). Such a stance can be expected to influence hu-  man resource policies, in turn shaping job design, recruitment and selection,  and training and development systems (Starik & Rands, 1995). In general,  when a firm adopts a sophisticated human resource management strategy  such as this, productivity improvements are captured (Koch & McGrath,  1995). One reason may be that attracting top candidates is easier for firms  known for environmental stewardship. According to Dechant and Altman:  Employees' views on a firm's environmental performance and  whether it fits their values profile frequently affects their will-  ingness to work for that firm. A 1991 McKinsey study of 403  senior executives from around the world revealed that sixty-  eight percent of them agreed that "organizations with a poor  environmental record will find it increasingly difficult to recruit  and retain high caliber staff (McKinsey, 1991, cited in Gladwin,  1993)." This perspective was validated by Mike Joyce, Division  Director of Environmental Affairs for Dexter Corporation, who  indicated that "college graduates are looking for more than just  a paycheck, they are looking for companies with which they can  identify morally and philosophically" (1994: 8).  Intangible resources. Two intangible factors suggest that better environ-  mental performance will augment profits. The first is that a reputation for  leadership in environmental affairs will increase sales among customers  who are sensitive to such issues. Indeed, such consumer actions appear to be  increasingly frequent: although the phenomenon of consumers tying firms'  social responsibility records to purchasing decisions is a relatively new one  (Murray & Montanari, 1986), it is reported to be gaining steam (Economist,  1994).2 The publication of popular handbooks, such as The Green Consumer  Supermarket Guide, and the implementation of independent rating pro-  grams, such as Green Cross and Green Seal, have facilitated environmentally  2 Further evidence of the rise of green consumers abounds. Environmental awareness, after  dipping in the mid-1980s, has again emerged as an issue globally and in America. A 1990 study  by the Roper Organization found that from 1987 to 1990, public concern about the environment  grew faster than concern about any other national problem. During this same period, the num-  ber of green product introductions quintupled to nearly 10 percent of all new products (Thayer,  1990), and the Sierra Club's membership rose an average of 13.9 percent annually (Sierra Club,  1993). Finally, nearly a third of consumers have purchased a product specifically for its green  labeling or advertising, and a quarter routinely read labels to gain an understanding of the  environmental impacts of products (Roper Organization, 1990).

Intermediate  purchasing behavior also reflects this trend: firms like McDonalds and Pru-  dential Insurance are pressuring upstream companies to "get greener" (Ho-  lusha, 1995).  As a firm develops an environmental policy, it must also develop a  reputation for that policy, since such a reputation is in itself a source of  market advantages. We observe such reputation-profit links in the business  world. Firms from ARCO to Procter & Gamble generally credit part of their  profits to a reputation for pro-environment corporate behavior (Harrison,  1993; Piasecki, 1995). An environmental reputation must be built on top of  an overall reputation for quality. Once gained, a pro-environment reputation  is itself a valuable inimitable resource. Haagen-Dazs cannot purchase Ben &  Jerry's reputation, nor can it effectively replicate that reputation in the short  term.  One intangible asset that has received little previous attention in re-  source-based theory development is an organization's political acumen,  which we define as the ability to influence public policies in ways that  confer a competitive advantage. This neglect of corporate political strategy  may be a result of managers viewing it as outside of their primary respon-  sibilities (Post, 1978). But savvy executives have firmly grasped the worth of  political strategy as a strategic resource (Mahon, 1989). Political skills are an  inimitable, valuable resource that can be used to neutralize, promote, or  otherwise manage external constituencies.  Managers following a compliance policy tend to employ legislative and  political lobbying aimed at slowing down the pace of environmental legis-  lation (Logsdon, 1985). This externally directed approach stands in contrast  to the technical and organizational focus of a prevention policy. Prevention-  oriented firms develop skills that help them adopt external technologies to  meet the demands of society and even move to "raise the floor" in that regard  (Starik & Rands, 1995: 923), but compliance-oriented firms develop political  acumen to fend off these imperatives. Such a reactive focus with respect to  other elements of firm strategy (e.g., product design or customer service)  would clearly be seen as inferior.  In summary, a resource-based analysis of the link between environmen-  tal performance and economic performance leads directly to our first hy-  pothesis:  Hypothesis 1. High levels of environmental performance  will be associated with enhanced profitability.  The Moderating Effect of Industry Growth  In this section, we discuss physical assets and technologies, human  resources and organizational capabilities, and intangible resources in turn,  arguing that industry context in general, and the growth within an industry  in particular, moderate the influence of social performance on economic This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1997 Russo and Fouts 541  performance. As noted above, the majority of work in this area has stressed  issues internal to firms. Here, we try to trace why firms are more likely to  reap benefits from increased social performance when they are in high-  growth industries rather than low-growth industries.  Physical assets and technology. Movement toward the prevention mode  of operation increases a firm's level of risk. Under normal conditions, an  investment in redesigning and replacing existing processes in a competitive  environment is financially significant and involves substantial risk. How-  ever, the decision to adopt clean technologies and to incur the added costs  of pollution reduction without governmental action is even more risky for  two reasons. First, early in their life cycles, technologies and processes that  are on the cutting edge of source reduction may cost more and be of lower  quality than they will be when they become off-the-shelf technologies of the  type described above (Groenewegen & Vergragt, 1991; Kemp, 1993). Second,  the viability of new, clean technologies can be largely unknown, as are the  economic consequences of their use (Kemp, 1993; Shrivastava, 1995a).  Regardless of industry context, prevention entails risk, but we argue that  for two reasons, industry growth influences how returns to this risk affect  profitability. According to discounted cash flow analysis, the level of an  industry's growth moderates the expected probabilities of return (Brealey &  Myers, 1991), because the expected payoff of any investment risk is higher in  high-growth industries. Another factor relates to the technology life cycle  (Abernathy & Utterback, 1978). In general, industry growth accelerates the  maturation of a technology, which rapidly reduces the levels of risk inherent  in investing in a long-lived technology at its emergent point. Thus, firms that  invest in a pollution prevention policy, although adding to risk, also have a  higher prospective return in a high-growth industry. Firms that fail to invest  in newer technologies would suffer comparatively. Likewise, a pollution  prevention policy will face a lower prospective return in a low-growth or  declining industry. Rapid turnover of technologies in high-growth industries  may also promote the learning-based organizational spillovers that were  described above.  Organizational capabilities. Another major reason that we expected re-  turns to environmental performance to be higher in high-growth industries  involves organizational capabilities.3 To make this argument, we refer to the  two primary environmental thrusts discussed above: compliance, the so-  called end-of-pipe approach, and prevention, the system that stresses source  reduction and process innovation (Hart, 1995). Although a bureaucratic  3 We do not address the issue of human resources in this section (as we did in the analogous  section on direct effects), as we feel that here most such arguments would be speculative. For  example, one line of reasoning might run something like this: in high-growth industries, em-  ployee growth is higher, and firms will be less likely to suffer from the organizational inertia  that blocks pro-environmental change (Shrivastava, 1995a). Such conditions might also provide  "a climate conducive to risk-taking and persistent problem solving" (Drumwright, 1992: 32),  which promotes environmental improvement.

The likelihood of an organic  structure's being in place depends partly on industry growth.  Low-growth industries are more likely to be populated by mature firms  selling standardized products (Hofer, 1975). Under such conditions, organ-  izational structures can be expected to be hierarchical, inflexible, and bu-  reaucratic (Burns & Stalker, 1961). Within such organizations, then, adopt-  ing policies and procedures associated with pollution prevention would be  difficult, as they require a loosening of organizational structures and norms.  Furthermore, such changes might well degrade performance if more mecha-  nistic (Burns & Stalker, 1961) structures are associated with high perfor-  mance in mature industries (Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967). For higher-growth  industries, one would expect more organic structures to be in place, a situ-  ation that would facilitate pollution prevention efforts. An organic structure  may also allow a firm that has more unabsorbed slack (Singh, 1986) to invest  in environmental improvements.  Intangible resources. In this section, we discuss two intangible re-  sources, reputation and political acumen. Both resources can work for or  against a firm. With respect to reputation, we expect the connection between  environmental performance and profitability to be stronger as industry  growth rises. Assuming, as above, that consumers respond to reputations for  environmental stewardship, the question is why such reputations are easier  to construct in high-growth industries.  Growing industries are much more likely to experience entry by new  players, and they are subject to methods and rules of competition that are  still in flux (Porter, 1980). Initial reputations are still being established. If it  is true that "the cumulative investments that firms consistently make in  different domains over a long period of time are more likely to influence the  cognitive interpretations of stakeholders" (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990: 254),  then it follows (1) that an initial reputation is partly a matter of firm choice  (for instance, trying to be known for being green versus being known for  customer service) and (2) that once established, a reputation is difficult to  change. This latter point is important, as firms in older, more mature indus-  tries tend to have preexisting reputations on numerous other dimensions.  Shrum and Wuthnow (1988), for example, found that the performance-  reputation association was tighter in photovoltaics, a growth industry, than  in nuclear power, a mature industry. It is also true that when a firm is in an  older, basic manufacturing industry, detriments to its reputation tend to  affect consumer perceptions of the entire industry, as the Exxon Valdez  disaster demonstrated (Jennings & Zandbergen, 1995; Koen, 1992). Such  spillovers would tend to dampen the returns to positive environmental per-  formance that occur in low-growth industries.  A second intangible asset follows from an examination of political strat-  egy. How would the development and use of political resources differ in This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1997 Russo and Fouts 543  high- and low-growth industries? High-growth industries tend to be younger  industries. Yoffie (1988) argued strongly for use, in such a setting, of a  political strategy that stresses establishment of an institutional framework  amenable to all players. That is, in a young industry the focus tends to be on  the industry as a whole, and not on capturing direct firm-specific advantages  vis-'a-vis competitors.  In lower-growth industries, the situation is more complex. Political ac-  tion in such settings is more proactive (Raelin, 1984). Here, political strate-  gies tend to center on so-called rent-seeking (Buchanan, Tollison, & Tullock,  1980), the securing of competitive advantage via political means. Leone  (1986) provided many examples of such tactics (generally, in accounts of  mature industries), such as firms favoring pollution control regulation  whose costs fell disproportionately on their competitors. Independent as-  sessments of environmental performance, such as those developed by the  Investor Responsibility Research Center (1995), often include expenditures  for pollution control. In this case, a high-spending firm may appear to be  more environmentally conscious, while actually impairing its cost position  in its industry, and hence, its profitability.  In our discussion of the contrasting political tendencies of compliance  and prevention firms in the preceding section, we noted that a compliance  policy stresses a political strategy for competitive advantage, but a preven-  tion policy stresses technical and organizational solutions instead. In a high-  growth environment, the political actions associated with a compliance  strategy are out of step with the needs and prevailing attitude of the industry  and should yield less success. Likewise, success in lower-growth environ-  ments often demands reliance on the political strategies characteristic of a  compliance policy.  The preceding remarks suggest that the growth rate of an industry mod-  erates the connection between environmental performance and profitability.  Hence,  Hypothesis 2. The level of an industry's growth will mod-  erate the relationship between the environmental perfor-  mance and profitability of firms in that industry; the  greater the industry growth, the greater the positive im-  pact of environmental performance on firm profitability.  EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS  Sample, Methods, and Measures  We began with the group of firms assigned environmental ratings by the  Franklin Research and Development Corporation (FRDC). This set of 477  firms spans all industrial classifications. We drew data on the firms for the  years 1991 and 1992, using these years (1) because the first FRDC ratings This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  544 Academy of Management Journal June  were made in 1991 and were based on data from that year and previous  years4 and (2) because two years seemed to us to represent an adequate  period in which to test the influence of environmental performance, without  letting too much time lapse between the measurement of the dependent and  independent variables. The two-year period and lagging all independent  variables that did not represent change scores by one year allowed us to test  for causality.  We drew a number of financial statistics from COMPUSTAT for each  company. We removed utilities, whose returns are subject to statutory limits;  70 observations per year were removed for this reason. Also removed were  firms with missing data for one or more variables, predominantly the adver-  tising, industry concentration, and firm sales growth variables. For 1991, 137  firms were excluded because of such missing data, and for 1992 exclusions  were roughly the same. We then deleted a small number of observations for  firms that had either grown or shrunk by more than 50 percent in either of  the two years (3 firms in 1991). We used this procedure because these firms  may have experienced major sell-offs, restructurings, or acquisitions that  would have made them a source of bias (firms that had themselves been  acquired were not rated by the FRDC). The predictive power of the models  increased greatly after we removed these firms, which suggests that includ-  ing them would have introduced misspecification to our models. Finally, we  removed firms for which data were available for 1991 but not 1992, or vice  versa (24 firms in 1991). The final sample size was 243 firms.  Environmental ratings were based directly on the scores given to the  sample firms by the FRDC. These scores are based on a number of criteria,  such as compliance records, expenditures, and other initiatives used to meet  new demands, to reduce waste reduction, and to support environmental  protection organizations. Thus, the ratings are well-matched to our theory,  which explicitly highlights compliance and prevention efforts by firms. Not  based on self-reports, the FRDC ratings correlate negatively and significantly  with 1989 firm toxic releases per unit of sales (p < .01) and an index devel-  oped by the Investor Responsibility Research Center (1995) to track fines and  penalties in 1989 (p < .02). The 1989 figures were the most recent figures  available during 1991, as there is a lag between the reporting of such infor-  mation and its issuance by the federal government. The ratings are internally  adjusted for industry conditions, and virtually all industries contain firms  with high and low ratings (a more complete description of the FRDC rating  system appears in the Appendix). As the FRDC ratings were not systemati-  cally updated during this period, we held them constant for the two years.  4 Unfortunately, unlike many social science phenomena, such as product recalls, hostile  acquisition attempts, and job changes, for which the number of discrete events in a year can be  counted, assessments such as the FRDC ratings are difficult to associate with an exact time  frame. This follows from the consideration of data from previous years in the decision calculus  in a later year. Thus, we felt that it was proper to include 1991 data in our analysis. However,  separate results for 1991 and 1992 are provided in our tabulated results.

Our dependent variable was a company's return on assets, or ROA, a  generally accepted measure of firm performance. In choosing control vari-  ables, we began with a list of the seven causal variables most prevalent in  prior studies of performance (Capon, Farley, & Hoenig, 1990). These were  industry concentration, firm growth rate, firm size, capital intensity, re-  search and development intensity, advertising intensity, and market share.  We dropped market share from consideration, because of a complete lack of  data, and also dropped research and development, because many data were  missing and the variable was consistently insignificant in trial regressions.  We added industry growth rate, as our hypotheses cast this variable in a  moderating role. Drawing on Capon and colleagues' (1990) findings, we  expected the signs of these controls (including industry growth) to be posi-  tive, except for firm size, which had no consistent effect in that study, and  capital intensity, which weighed in negatively when measured at the firm  level.  We operationally defined the controls as follows: Industry concentra-  tion was measured as the four-firm concentration ratio at the four-digit Stan-  dard Industrial Classification (SIC) level and was taken from the 1987 Cen-  sus of Manufactures (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1992). Recently pub-  lished reports now provide these data for nonmanufacturing firms for the  first time (e.g., U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995). Firm growth rate was  a firm's annual change in sales, expressed as a percentage. The natural loga-  rithm of sales volume served as a proxy for firm size, and capital intensity  was defined as the ratio of assets to sales. Industry growth was the average  annual increase in sales for four years (1991 observations) or five years (1992  observations); we could not go further back because of the revision of the  Standard Industrial Classification system in 1987. For industry growth, we  used the most consistent set of data we found, from the U.S. Bureau of the  Census, which provided numbers at the three-digit SIC level. Because we  pooled two years of data, we included a dummy variable set equal to 1 if an  observation was from 1991 and to 0 otherwise. The purpose of this variable  was to pick up fixed effects that varied between the two years. All variables  except for the FRDC ratings changed between 1991 and 1992.  As noted above, numerous firms had missing values for advertising  intensity, so we undertook a special procedure to fill in these data (the  figures provided above for missing data refer to conditions obtaining after  the following procedure had been carried out). We began by measuring ad-  vertising intensity as annual expenses for that function divided by firm size.  For a small number of observations, size was not available, so we used  annual industry averages printed in Advertising Age.  To test Hypothesis 2, we used an interaction term formed by multiplying  the FRDC environmental variable and industry growth. As is often the case,  the interaction term was highly correlated with its constituents, a situation  that can produce multicollinearity and unstable regression estimates. There- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  546 Academy of Management Journal June  fore, we employed the procedure suggested by Aiken and West (1991) to  confront this problem. The Aiken and West approach calls for "de-meaning"  (or centering) the direct terms by subtracting the mean of each variable from  the values for each observation. Coefficient estimates for equations without  the interaction term are not changed. More importantly, as we show below,  the interaction term created by the multiplication of the two de-meaned  direct variables displays little correlation with those direct terms when it is  inserted thereafter.5 We used ordinary least squares regression techniques.  With only two years and 243 firms, we chose not to correct for autocorrela-  tion under the assumption that our statistical approach should reflect our  data, which look far more like a cross section than a time series.6  RESULTS  Descriptive statistics appear in Table 1. Correlations are generally low,  with the exception of the relationship between the firm growth rate and  ROA, and the industry growth and interaction terms, which are strong and  positive. The last correlation provides initial support for Hypothesis 2. Of  special note is the pattern of correlations between the interaction term and  its constituent terms. Because we constructed the interaction term used in  the correlations and regressions by multiplying the de-meaned industry  growth and environmental ratings variables, correlations with those vari-  ables are modest, and one correlation is negative. If we had used an inter-  action term formed by simply multiplying together the industry growth and  environmental ratings variables, their correlations with the interaction term  would have been .95 and .28, respectively. Thus, our goal of constructing a  meaningful test of direct and interactive effects by reducing multicollinear-  ity was achieved.  Table 2 shows regression results with 1991 and 1992 data pooled. Model  1 includes the control variables. The coefficient on the firm growth rate is  positive and highly significant, as is the coefficient on advertising intensity.  Of the remaining control variables, capital intensity is significant and acts in  the expected direction, firm size and the 1991 dummy variable are signifi-  cant and positive, and the concentration ratio is insignificant. In this equa-  tion, industry growth is significant and positive, demonstrating an effect  separate from that of firm growth. Thus, of five control variables for which  we had prior expectations, four were significant predictors of profitability  and acted in the expected direction. This observation added to our confi-  dence in the regression modeling, because it indicated that we were picking  5 We thank an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this procedure.  e We also checked for the presence of heteroskedasticity in our estimation using an option  available in the statistical package SHAZAM (White, Wong, Whister, & Haum, 1990). There is  no single test for heteroskedasticity, and its presence could not be established. To double-check,  we generated the regression equations again, employing White's (1980) correction for hetero-  skedasticity. Results were very similar to those we present here.

Total explained variance is at or above levels obtained in other studies  estimating return ratios and using control variables (e.g., Huselid, 1995;  Ilinitch & Zeithaml, 1995; Tosi & Gomez-Mejia, 1994).  Model 2 tests Hypothesis 1 by including a direct effect for the environ-  mental performance variable. Its coefficient is positive and significant at the  p < .004 level, providing solid support for Hypothesis 1. Although the in-  crease in the equation's R2 is modest, it should be borne in mind that the  equation already contains seven control variables. However, this increment  in explained variance is highly significant, indicating that the impact of the  environmental performance variable is not due to collinearity with other  variables in the equation. Model 3 tests Hypothesis 2 by adding the interac-  tion term to the regression equation. As with the addition of the environ-  mental performance variable, the variance explained rises modestly, but  significantly. The pattern of the coefficients on all the variables from the  previous model changes little. Of particular importance is the fact that the This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1997 Russo and Fouts 549  coefficients on the environmental performance variable and industry growth  variables shift very little in either value or significance level, showing that  our strategy of de-meaning those variables produced the desired stability in  regression estimation. The interaction term is significant and acts in the  hypothesized direction. Thus, our results show that although the contribu-  tion to the explained variance in firm performance made by our variables of  interest is modest, higher environmental performance is associated with  higher financial performance, and the relationship is strengthened as indus-  try growth rises.  To explore this effect further, we evaluated model 2 by taking the partial  derivative of the regression equation with respect to the environmental per-  formance variable, yielding the following:  8(ROA)I8(environmental rating) = 1.59 + (0.51 x de-meaned industry growth).  Setting this expression equal to 0 and solving for industry growth yields a  value of -3.14 percent for de-meaned industry growth. That is, increasing  environmental performance improved the bottom line in all cases where  (de-meaned) industry growth was greater than -3.14 percent, which is true  in virtually all of our data. Thus, our results indicate that "it pays to be  green" as a rule, and that this relationship strengthens as industry growth  increases. The industry context facing a firm is a key determinant of the  effect of environmental performance on financial profitability, confirming  Hypothesis 2.  To examine the robustness of our results, we split our data by year and  conducted analyses of 1991 (models 4, 5, and 6) and 1992 (models 7, 8, and  9) separately. Results, shown in Table 3, provide support for our findings. In  terms of our control variables, the value of the coefficients is quite consistent  as we compare analogous models (for example, compare model 1 to models  4 and 7). But there are some shifts in significance levels. The coefficient on  the environmental performance variable drops just below generally accepted  significance levels in 1991 (p .10 and .11 in models 5 and 6, respectively),  perhaps because of the degrees of freedom lost by splitting the data. How-  ever, this variable is significant in 1992, as shown in models 8 and 9. The  interaction term is significant in both 1991 and 1992. In all cases, the sig-  nificance levels of the increases in variance explained follow the signifi-  cance levels of the coefficients on the variables added. Our general conclu-  sion, therefore, is that support for our hypotheses is robust.  CONCLUSION  In this concluding section, we return to our motivation for this study,  review our results, and take a step back to try to place them in perspective.  At this point, we feel it necessary to reiterate that our variables of interest do  not account for more than a modest level of variation in firm performance.  For example, in models 2 and 3 respectively, the variation explained rises by  roughly 1 percent of the total variance and 4 percent of the explained vari- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  550 Academy of Management Journal June  TABLE 3  Regression Results, Individual Yearsa  1991 1992  Variable Model 4 Model 5 Model 6 Model 7 Model 8 Model 9  Constant -1.42 -1.58 -1.70 -1.62 -1.93 -1.98  (2.80) (2.80) (2.79) (3.24) (3.22) (3.18)  Firm growth rate 0.37** 0.36** 0.36** 0.26** 0.25** 0.27**  (0.04) (0.04) (0.04) (0.04) (0.04) (0.04)  Advertising intensity 0.20t 0.21t 0.21t 0.26* 0.31* 0.32*  (0.11) (0.11) (0.11) (0.04) (1.13) (0.13)  Firm size 0.61t 0.64t 0.66t 0.39 0.46 0.46  (0.34) (0.33) (0.33) (0.39) (0.39) (0.38)  Capital intensity -0.38 -0.41 -0.38 -0.60 -0.66t -0.74*  (0.33) (0.33) (0.33) (0.38) (0.38) (0.38)  Industry concentration -0.00 -0.00 -0.01 0.00 -0.00 -0.00  (0.02) (0.02) (0.02) (0.02) (0.02) (0.02)  Industry growth rate 0.29* 0.31* 0.28* 0.85** 0.83** 0.80**  (0.13) (0.13) (0.13) (0.16) (0.16) (0.15)  Environmental rating 1.13 1.10 1.60* 1.95*  (0.69) (0.69) (0.77) (0.78)  Industry growth rate x 0.37t 0.76*  environmental rating (0.22) (0.29)  R2 .33 .34 .35 .28 .29 .31  AR2 .01 .01 .01 .02  F-test for AR2 2.66 2.78* 4.28* 6.97**  a N = 243.

But given that a number of well-established control variables were  entered into the equation, we consider the finding of relatively consistent  patterns of significance and coefficients on our variables of interest of clear  scholarly value. In the remarks that follow, we attempt to provide further  insight on the issues raised, while staying within the bounds of what our  data analysis yielded.  Returns to Corporate Social Performance: Inching Closer to Resolution  Wood and Jones (1995) attributed the inconsistent statistical findings on  the relationship between corporate social performance and economic per-  formance to "stakeholder mismatching," or comparing the economic out-  come desired by one set of stakeholders (e.g., shareholders) to corporate  actions desired by another set of stakeholders (e.g., environmental activists).  For example, the fact that profit and corporate crime are positively correlated  (Baucus & Near, 1991) might be due to the fact that such behavior often  results in no traceable cost or consumer reaction.  In many settings, this interstakeholder dichotomy is a sharp one, and it This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1997 Russo and Fouts 551  generates equivocal findings with respect to how corporate social perfor-  mance affects profits. However, we emphasize that the interests of distinct  stakeholders are not orthogonal as a rule, or even necessarily aligned un-  evenly. Indeed, the Economist has argued that society is entering "the era of  corporate image, in which consumers will increasingly make purchases on  the basis of a firm's whole role in society: how it treats employees, share-  holders, and local neighborhoods" (1994: 71). Thus, to the extent that ac-  tions by downstream users and consumers elicit desired corporate behavior,  stakeholder interests may parallel one another. As a social issue, environ-  mental concerns are somewhat unique in terms of how strongly they appear  to be manifested in the marketplace. This occurs because environmental  concern correlates strongly with income, and therefore with purchasing lev-  els (Roper Organization, 1990). But it should be noted that since the relative  influence of consumers is not democratic but is based on what they spend,  marketplace outcomes will not always reflect social equity considerations.  Factors internal to firms also result in environmental concerns being a  unique social issue. Our theoretical development is in broad agreement with  Post (1991) and Post and Altman (1992), who argued that environmental  issues are more systemic than other social issues and affect a broader con-  stellation of organizational functions. In fact, the recently developed ISO  14000 international environmental management standards aim to institu-  tionalize the idea of a systemic approach (Tibor & Feldman, 1996). Through-  out our application of the resource-based view of the firm, this systemic  dimension of environmentalism underlies our theory of how proactive poli-  cies translate into internal competitive advantages. By way of contrast, a  good example of a corporate social policy that lacks this systemic nature  would be investment in South Africa, which would tend to be more sepa-  rable from the core elements of a firm. This observation could help to explain  Meznar, Nigh, and Kwok's (1994) finding that announcements of withdraw-  als from South Africa resulted in losses in shareholder wealth.  Taken as a whole, our study indicates that the resource-based view of  the firm can be applied fruitfully to corporate social responsibility issues.  This in turn suggests a greater breadth of application for resource-based  theories. Our dependent variable in this case is economic performance, but  our overall thrust is consistent with a theoretical framework that could pre-  dict corporate social responsiveness or choice of political strategy. Hart  (1995) used such an approach, positioning social legitimacy as a perfor-  mance criterion when he applied resource-based theory to corporate envi-  ronmental performance. To the extent that corporate social policies are sys-  temic, this view may explain the type of social complexity underlying some  forms of sustainable competitive advantage.  The Moderating Influence of External Conditions on Corporate Strategy  We found evidence that the connection between environmental perfor-  mance and economic performance strengthens in higher-growth industries.  Although the idea that outcomes of more traditional organizational initia- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  552 Academy of Management Journal June  tives and strategies are partially contingent on external environments is  well-established (Prescott, 1986), our study extends this notion to encom-  pass environmental initiatives. The results also square with Collis and Mont-  gomery's (1995) assertion that fitting internal resources to external demands  is a critical strategic issue.  If in the long run the external constraints on firms are not legal or  regulatory, but physical (Hart, 1985), firms will need to be even more atten-  tive to those demands. Prospering under such conditions will demand in-  novative thinking. Perhaps one avenue open to managers is to use their  capabilities and resources to push an industry through what Shrivastava  (1995b) called "eco-renewal" and find ways to improve industry growth  through environmental initiatives. Such a renewal would benefit a firm not  only directly, but also indirectly, by changing the nature of the competition  it faces in ways that enhance returns to its resource base.  Our theory led us to believe that industry growth moderates the rela-  tionship between corporate social policies and performance. Might other  variables also influence this relationship? The answer almost certainly is  yes. In studying the complexities of industrial change, Mitchell recognized  the necessity "to treat some factors as independent in what we recognize is  really a non-linear multi-equation system and probably a chaotic one at that"  (1989: 227). We have made simplifying assumptions here, and subsequent  research may identify other causal agents that act on our system of variables.  Identifying Research Needs  Although in our analysis, the benefits of improved corporate environ-  mental behavior appear to outweigh its costs, the exact calculus of this  comparison is by no means clear and demands further examination. One  conspicuous research implication is that if superior environmental perfor-  mance drives higher returns, researchers need to identify the full chain of  variables connecting the end links. If, as we assert, company-initiated poli-  cies play a role in improving economic performance, an important study  could follow companies before and after important pro-environment  changes, to gain insight on which policies yield the most acute bottom-line  effects. Researchers are likely to find that better information on these poli-  cies is needed. It would also be helpful to understand where returns to  environmental performance end. That is, at some point, do resources be-  come so focused on environmental issues that a firm shortchanges other key  functions, such as customer service?  Research that is explicitly longitudinal would also offer benefits. If one  accepts the proposition that industries generally move from high growth to  lower or even negative growth (Hofer, 1975), then with respect to environ-  mental performance, a logical outcome of our study is that the resource  endowment of a firm will have to change accordingly, because the resource  base that yields rents in the early stage may be less productive thereafter. For  example, the resources represented by political strategy will need to evolve  with time. This process of developing new capabilities is fraught with dif- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1997 Russo and Fouts 553  ficulty, and we agree with Barney (1986) that how firms recognize the need  to change key resources over time and act upon these imperatives is a subject  that deserves further development.  Also poorly understood is the precise role of consumption behavior in  the social performance-economic performance equation. Empirical analysis  of the purchasing behavior of downstream users and consumers with respect  to environmental product attributes is clearly warranted. One research proj-  ect with great potential returns would be a panel study of downstream users  and consumers that followed purchases across time and could track what  influenced the change to and continued purchase of green products. It could  also confirm how closely actions match attitudes.  Managing for Environmental Quality and Economic Performance  As noted above, a general danger with shaping a firm's resources for the  long run is that industry transitions may render previously critical resources  of marginal value. If, as Hart (1995) suggested, industrial society will evolve  to the point where sustainable development is the norm, then technological,  organizational, and human resources that serve a firm's environmental aims  now should be even more valuable then. But protecting and enhancing the  value of resources requires careful oversight and supportive actions. For  example, a firm's pro-environment reputation demands continued invest-  ment in consistency of action, so that the firm's advantage does not erode  from within. As recent attacks on The Body Shop have shown (Entine, 1995),  although there is considerable "unclaimed reputation 'space' with respect to  corporate environmental performance" (Hart, 1995: 995), significant risks  await firms that do not hold true to expressed principles.  One keystone issue for corporations is how to treat existing environ-  mental standards. There is evidence that many corporations regard pollution  limits as minimums and try to exceed minimal compliance levels and po-  sition themselves for future changes in policy (Business Week, 1990). This  would appear to be a wise strategy, as increased popular interest in the  environment may translate into a tightening of standards. In fact, in the  specific context of environmental regulations, the idea of trying to burden  competitors with greater regulatory mandates via the pursuit of regulation  that is asymmetric across competitors (Leone, 1986) could actually backfire  if consumers reward consistent excellence in this regard. Furthermore, the  increasing availability of environmental information "implies that the lag-  gards in environmental performance will more likely suffer at the hands of  consumers, while those following an effective proactive approach will  thrive" (Dean, Fowler, & Miller, 1995: 12).  Another reason to go beyond compliance is that the organizational in-  novation with which such a strategy is associated is well matched to the  trend in environmental regulation itself. The pattern of regulatory legislation  in America appears to be evolving from one of "command and control" to  one that uses market-like mechanisms, such as offsets, "bubbles," and trad-  able emissions permits, to achieve environmental gains (Hahn & Hester, This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  554 Academy of Management Journal June  1989). Such a trend will benefit firms that have promoted flexibility in their  approach to environmental policy, because using market tools to improve  the environment allows firms to tailor their responses to their own needs and  to seek innovative solutions to meeting their responsibilities. More gener-  ally, however, we believe that moving aggressively toward environmental  improvement will help firms to become more entrepreneurial on a number  of key dimensions that we have noted above.  Cairncross labeled the rise of environmental concern "perhaps the big-  gest opportunity for enterprise and invention the industrial world has ever  seen" (1992: 177). We have not identified and measured every link in a  complex causal chain, but our study suggests that shrewd managers have  recognized this possibility and set to work assembling the organizational  resources necessary to capitalize on this opportunity. Managers who instead  resist and contest pressures for environmental improvement risk not only a  profound loss of productive energy, but also a bottom-line loss of equal  proportions.

APPENDIX  The Development of the Environmental Ratings Used in This Study  The following are excerpts from the Franklin Research and Development Corporation's  1989 publication, which provides a concise statement of what each rating indicates. The FRDC  lists these four specific questions it asks when evaluating companies:  Is the company in compliance with state and federal environmental regulations? Does it  have major environmental lawsuits pending? Does it have a record of environmental contro-  versy? Has it gone beyond the letter of the law in dealing with pollution problems?  Where comparative environmental studies of an industry have been conducted, how has  the company performed relative to others in its industry?  What efforts has the company made in reducing the generation of hazardous wastes and in  the proper disposal of those wastes it generates?  Does the company contribute to, or otherwise support, nonprofit environmental protection  organizations?  We transformed the FRDC ratings to the following numbering system, under which high  numbers mean better environmental performance.  5: The company has taken exceptional initiatives in environmental matters with a reputa-  tion for going beyond its peers in pollution control or hazardous waste reduction. The company  has shown unusually strong support for environmental organizations.  4: The company has demonstrated a strong concern in limited areas for the environment. It  has no major environmental controversies pending. It has been moderately supportive of envi-  ronmental organizations.  3: The company has an environmental record that is mixed, distinguishes itself neither This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 01:56:43 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1997 Russo and Fouts 559  positively nor negatively on the environment, or is not in an industry with substantial envi-  ronmental challenges.  2: The company has an environmental record characterized by occasional major environ-  mental controversy or litigation. It has fared poorly in environmental studies of its industry.  1: The company has a consistent history of pollution control or other environmental prob-  lems. The company is currently at the center of a major environmental controversy where the  responsiveness of its actions are questionable. It has taken few or no steps to support environ-  mental organizations.  Michael V. Russo is an associate professor of management at the Charles H.
