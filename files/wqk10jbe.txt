This article studies how financial investors respond to firms’ corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance in terms of their investing behaviors, and how such behaviors change contingent on an event that provokes their attention and concerns to CSR. Using the melamine contamination incident in China as a natural experiment, it is found that neither the individual inves- tors’ nor the institutional investors’ behaviors are influ- enced by firms’ CSR performance before the incident. Nevertheless, institutional investors’ behaviors are significantly influenced by firms’ CSR performance that exceeds a certain threshold. Fur- thermore, such an effect diminishes for a better CSR performance. In comparison, the authors do not find any effects of CSR performance on individual investors, either before the event or after the event. Finally, firms’ per- formance and investors’ behaviors jointly affect firms’ stock returns after the event but not before the event. This article reconciles the mixed findings in the literature on the effect of firms’ CSR performance on their financial performance by showing that such an effect exists in a contingent manner. Furthermore, the authors show that a too low or a too high CSR performance could lead to undesirable responses from investors. Therefore, managers should pay attention to optimizing firms’ CSR activities.

The extant literature in this ?eld – the so-called corporate social responsi- bility (CSR) – supports the notion that going beyond pro?t maximization and caring about the interests of society, consumers, and employees are bene?cial to a ?rm’s long-term performance in operations (e.g., Luo and Bhattacharya, 2009; McWilliams and Siegel, 2001; Pava and Krausz, 1996; Solomon and Hansen, 1985; Whetten et al., 2002).  (McWilliams  funds) explicitly favor ?rms  Nevertheless, studies on CSR and ?rms’ per- formance on the ?nancial market report mixed and Siegel, 1997) even ?ndings socially responsible though some investors (e.g., that are investment socially responsible. Some researchers detect a positive relationship (e.g., Posnikoff, 1997), some discover a negative relationship (e.g., Wright and Ferris, 1997), and others ?nd no relationship (e.g., Teoh et al., 1999). One plausible explanation for the discrepant results is the time frame of CSR activities: the costs of CSR are immediate, whereas many of its bene?ts are not realized promptly; therefore, investors with different timeframes value ?rms’ CSR performance differently (Tsoutsoura, 2004).  Since a ?rm’s ?nancial performance is directly affected by investors’ buying and selling behaviors, to understand how investors perceive CSR is critical to understanding the relationship between a ?rm’s CSR activities and its ?nancial performance. Nevertheless, despite its importance, this area is quite under- explored. In this article, such a relationship via the event-study approach is investigated. Speci?cally,  128  Maobin Wang et al.

It is also proposed that the in?uence of CSR on investors varies depending on the type of investors (institutional investors versus individual investors). Finally, the authors postulate that a ?rm’s CSR performance affects its short-term ?nancial perfor- mance after the event but not before it.  Using China’s melamine contamination incident in 2008 as a natural experiment, the authors ?nd strong support for the above hypotheses. In addition, the authors detect two effects of CSR on investors’ behaviors ex post the event. Speci?cally, a ?rm’s CSR performance positively affects investors’ buy- ing and selling of its stocks only when the CSR performance exceeds a lower bound. On the other hand, the effect of CSR demonstrates a diminishing pattern on investors’ behaviors.  This article makes three contributions. First, it enhances our understanding of the role played by CSR in investors’ behaviors at large, which is found to be contingent on investors’ attention to ?rms’ CSR performance, which was triggered by a CSR event. Hence, this article offers one explanation that reconciles the contradicting ?ndings in the literature regarding ?rms’ CSR and ?nancial performance. Second, this article documents the varied responses of different investors to CSR. It is found that insti- tutional investors are more sensitive to CSR per- formance than individual is observed that the positive effects of CSR perfor- mance on investors’ behaviors occur only when CSR performance stays above a certain threshold. These ?ndings offer a critical insight for optimizing CSR performance.  investors.

Literature review  This article is related to two streams of literature. The ?rst stream is on the effect of CSR on invest- ment performance, which is an interesting topic to both practitioners and academia. An extant literature uses social screens as main ?lters for evaluating CSR performance. Given the tension between modern portfolio theory and CSR performance (Derwall et al., 2005; Kurtz, 2005), the relationship between investment strategies and CSR is a critical issue. There are two competing theories explaining the impact of incorporating social screens in investors’ decisions. On the one hand, arguments based on portfolio theory argue that the construction of portfolios on the basis of a restricted universe of stocks will compromise the bene?ts of full diversi- ?cation (Rudd, 1981). Furthermore, the additional costs of monitoring social performance will also cause lower returns. Accordingly, investment port- folios based on CSR (the so-called SRI funds) should exhibit underperformance relative to con- ventional peers. On the other hand, proponents of socially responsible investments argue that social screens are ?lters to select ?rms with higher quality of management. Consequently, portfolios composed of from improved performance in the long run (e.g., Hill et al., 2007). Empirical studies ?nd no statistical differences between the average performance of SRI and conventional funds in the U.S.1 (e.g., Benson et al. 2006; Hamilton et al., 1993). The empirical evidence for international markets provides mixed ?ndings about underperformance of SRI funds rel- ative to conventional ones (e.g., Bauer et al. 2005, 2006, 2007; Jones et al., 2008; Kreander et al., 2005).  socially responsible stocks will bene?t  This article is also related to the studies on ?rms’ motivation to conduct CSR activities. Traditional economic studies suggest that CSR is not part of managerial duties and may cause cash ?ow waste and, consequently, lead to a violation of the ?du- ciary relationship of managers with shareholders (Friedman, 1962). Nevertheless, advocates of the stakeholder theory argue that shareholder wealth maximizing behavior may be in accordance with social optimum in a framework in which well  Corporate Social Responsibility, Investor Behaviors, and Stock Market Returns  129  surpluses,’’ The proponents of  functioning institutions set proper rules and ?scal incentives to reconcile individual and social opti- mum. However, that behavior does not hold in an economic environment riddled by con?icts of interest, agency costs and informational asymmetries in which weak or missing institutions cannot per- form their task. Freeman (1984) argues that CSR may be the optimal strategy for minimizing trans- action costs with stakeholders (e.g., creditors, employees, suppliers, customers, and the society at large) in such a framework. Tirole (2001) points out that the concept of stakeholder value recognizes that corporate activity may create negative externalities which need to be counterbalanced, either by insti- tutional rules or by corporations themselves. In such a scenario, the ultimate value of shareholders’ wealth may be linked to ‘‘maximizing the sum of various stakeholder the stakeholder theory argue that sometimes the interests of other important stakeholders should supersede the interests of a ?rm’s in managerial decision-making, even if this reduces the present value of a ?rm’s cash ?ows (Clarkson, 1995; Don- aldson and Preston, 1995; Mitchell et al., 1997; Wood and Jones, 1995). Empirically, Solomon and Hansen (1985) observe that costs of CSR in terms of higher care for stakeholders are more than com- pensated by positive changes in employee morale and productivity; Pava and Krausz (1996) and Preston and O’Bannon (1997) ?nd that positive synergies exist between corporate performance and good stakeholder relationships; Ruf et al. (2001) highlight a positive link among CSR, growth in sales, and returns on sales. Considering the costs and bene?ts of CSR activities, their relationship with corporate performance becomes an empirical ques- tion, but the results are mixed (Margolis and Walsh, 2003).  shareholders  Empirical procedure  In this section, the empirical procedure that is used in this study is introduced. ‘‘Background’’ section introduces the industry background of the natural experiment. ‘‘Data’’ section explains the sources of our data. ‘‘Event study, abnormal returns, and net order ?ow’’ section details the event-study meth- odology.  Background  The melamine contamination incident in China It was secret that had been kept from the public: raw milk producers had been adding melamine, a chem- ical rich in nitrogen, into milk to boost the detected amount of nitrogen (as a proxy for protein content) in milk quality tests. Owing to the shortage of raw milk caused by the fast-growing demand for dairy products, dairy-product manufacturers in China had remained silent to the issue to compete for the raw milk they needed. Melamine is lethal to infants, and is also harmful to adults if a large dose is taken. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows amounts less than 2.5 parts per million in adult foods and zero in infant foods.  The melamine contamination incident broke out on September 11, 2008, when Sanlu Corpora- tion, one of China’s largest dairy manufacturers, announced that its products on sale had been con- taminated by melamine. Sanlu immediately recalled all of its products from the market. Since melamine was added to raw milk, consumers suspected that all kinds of dairy products could potentially be contaminated. The fear was con?rmed 2 days later when products of 22 brands (with total market shares exceeding 90% in liquid milk and 50% in powdered milk) were found to contain melamine (Chao, 2008). Later, in-depth reports revealed that the top management of the dairy companies involved knew that their products con- tained melamine long before the incident, but they were afraid that product recalls would heavily hurt their reputations and market shares. These dairy companies were accused of poorly managing their supply chain system, losing quality control, inten- tionally delaying product recall, and hiding recall from public. Hence, the melamine contamination incident is a typical CSR event.  From the investors’ perspective, the consequence of the incident was severe. Sanlu went bankrupt 5 months following the incident, and all the publicly traded dairy companies that were found faulty experienced a drastic decline (at least 30%) in stock prices.  CSR in China The ?rst CSR report in China was released by Shell China in 1999. Since then, the number of public- traded companies that voluntarily report their CSR  130  Maobin Wang et al.  activities has been growing (Kolk et al. 2007). With rapid economic growth in China, the issue of how to balance economic growth and social development is receiving growing attention by the general public, media, as well as government agencies at the various levels. CSR has also gained growing awareness among Chinese entrepreneurs. According to a sur- vey of 4586 Chinese companies conducted by the China Enterprise Survey System in 2007, nearly 55% of respondents said they have become familiar with CSR activities. Another survey conducted by the Social Science Academy of China in 2008 suggests that the majority of investors in China care about ?rms’ CSR activities. Shenzhen Stock Exchange, one of the two stock exchanges in China, encour- ages listed companies to regularly disclose their CSR activities. The other stock exchange, Shanghai Stock Exchange, launched a new CSR index in 2009.  Data  The authors sample all the ?rms listed on China’s stock markets with sales over 10 billion RMB (approximately 1.5 billion USD) in the 2007 ?scal year. The initial sample includes 118 ?rms. Three ?rms have subsequently been dropped given that their shares were in trading suspension and there were no trading activities during the period of study. To mitigate sample selection bias, one dairy industry ?rm was also dropped. Our ?nal sample consists of 114 ?rms. Trades and quotes data come from the RESSET Financial Database. The database is developed and maintained by Beijing Gildata RES- SET Data Tech and is publicly available. Other information collected from the RESSET Financial Database includes market capitalization, daily return, percentage of shares held by mutual funds, and other ?nancial variables.  The authors measured ?rms’ CSR performance in 2007 using the CSR scores compiled in 2008 by Southern Weekend, China’s leading weekly newspa- per targeting emerging middle-class readers with over 1.4 million circulation (Southern Weekend is the only news agency that had exclusively interviewed the U.S. President Barrack Obama during his 2009  to China.), A detailed description of  visit the methodology used by Southern Weekend is provided in Appendix B.  Out of the 114 ?rms in our sample, 86 ?rms were rated by Southern Weekend with a CSR score, and the remaining 28 ?rms were not rated. In Table I, sum- mary statistics of the key ?nancial measures for the two groups are presented. A between-group t-test indi- cates that there are signi?cant differences between the ?rms with CSR scores and those without CSR scores in terms of the fundamental measures such as total market capitalization, sales revenues, and return on equity. Hence, the authors control for the effects of heterogeneity in ?rms’ fundamental characteristics in the following regression tests.  Event study, abnormal returns, and net order ?ow  The authors use event-study methodology to investigate how CSR affects investors’ behaviors and stock prices before and after the melamine contam- ination incident. The event study was ?rst proposed by Fama et al. (1969), and since then it has been widely used in the ?elds of economics, ?nance, accounting, and marketing (for more information regarding the event study, please refer to MacKinlay (1997) for a summary). Described below is how the event study for this study is employed.  The authors begin with the analysis by de?ning the event day and the related periods for our study. The event day (T0) is the ?rst trading day after September 11, 2008, when the melamine contami- nation incident was made public nationally. The estimation window is the period over which how a stock normally relates to the market is estimated. Information in this window serves as a control con- dition; the event window is the period over which the investors’ response to the event is studied. A 22-day post-event window is used in this study since there are 22 trading days in one calendar month. For comparison purposes, a 22-day pre-event window is also chosen. As a robust check, the authors also use event windows of different lengths (estimate win- dows are changed accordingly), and the results are similar.  Corporate Social Responsibility, Investor Behaviors, and Stock Market Returns  131  Estimation window   Pre-event window  Post-event window   T0 - 274   T0 - 22  T0: event day  T0 + 22  The authors obtain the cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) and the cumulative abnormal net order ?ow (CANOF) for each ?rm in the sample for the pre- event and post-event windows, respectively. The two variables are the main variables of interest. Speci?cally, CAR is the cumulative change in a stock price across the event window that accounts for all the effects resulting from both industry and market-wide in?uences. CAR measures the overall ?nancial market responses to the event. CANOF measures investors’ cumulative net cash ?ow into (or out of) a ?rm’s stocks during the event window by investors. Thus, CANOF measures investors’ trading activities: a positive (negative) CANOF suggests that investors buy (sell) one stock over other stocks in the market in the event window.  The authors calculate the CAR and CANOF for  stock i over an event window [TS, TE] as follows:  CARi ¼  CANOFi ¼  X  TE  ARi; t;  ANOFi; t;  t¼TS X  TE  t¼TS  ð1Þ  ð2Þ  where TS and TE are the starting and ending days for pre-event win- of the window, respectively: dow, TS = T0 - 22, and TE = T0 - 1; for post- event window, TS = T0, and TE = T0 + 22. ARi,t (ANOFi,t) is the abnormal returns (the abnormal net order ?ow) for stock i at trading day t. The procedures on how to derive ARi,t and ANOFi,t are detailed in Appendix A.  Since the authors cannot directly observe investor types, i.e., individual investors versus institutional investors, the authors follow Lee and Radhakrishna (2000) and assume that small (large) trades are orig- inated mostly by individual (institutional) investors. Accordingly, the authors compute CANOFSmall and CANOFLarge based on the volume per trade: orders less than 100,000 are categorized as small, orders between 100,000 and 500,000 are categorized as medium, and orders greater than 500,000 are  large. Hence, CANOFSmall  and categorized as CANOFLarge measure the behaviors of individual and institutional investors, respectively.  Analysis and results  Model speci?cations  To examine and compare the CANOF for different ?rms around the event, the following speci?cation is used:      CANOFi ¼ c0 þ Di c1 þ c2CSRi þ c3CSR2  i  þ uXi þ ei;  is  ð3Þ where, Di is a dummy variable indicating whether or not ?rm i was given a CSR score by Southern the actual Weekend (1 = yes; 0 = no); CSRi score of social responsibility index computed by Southern Weekend, multiplied by 100 to scale the 2 is the quadratic term of reported estimates. CSRi CSRi which measures the second-order effect. Xi includes two controlling variables: Ln(size)i is the logarithm of market capitalization (prices multiply is the outstanding shares) of ?rm i; InstHoldingi percentage of shares held by institutional investors to the total tradable shares.

First, it allows the comparison between ?rms with and without assigned CSR scores, which is re?ected through the estimate of Di. If Di then investors demonstrate similar behaviors to the stocks of ?rms with and without CSR ratings. Second, the  is zero,  132  Maobin Wang et al.

Since a single regression that tests the presence and the linear and nonlinear effects of CSR performance on investors’ behaviors is conducted, the estimation is more ef?cient than running two separate regres- sions of (4) and (5) (Kennedy 2003).  The speci?cation in Eq. 3 can also be used to test the in?uence of CSR performance on the behaviors of individual investors, as well as those of institutional investors, by replacing CANOF with CANOFSmall or CANOFLarge.  The relationship between CAR and CANOF is  examined via the following empirical model: CARi ¼ a0 þ a1CANOFSmall  þ a2CANOFLarge
