THE RESOURCE-BASED VIEW OF THE FIRM IN  TWO ENVIRONMENTS: THE HOLLYWOOD FILM  STUDIOS FROM 1936 TO 1965  Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales, Montreal,  DANNY MILLER  and Columbia University  JAMAL SHAMSIE  New York University  This article continues to operationally define and test the resource-  based view of the firm in a study of the major U.S. film studios from  1936 to 1965. We found that property-based resources in the form of  exclusive long-term contracts with stars and theaters helped financial  performance in the stable, predictable environment of 1936-50. In con-  trast, knowledge-based resources in the form of production and coordi-  native talent and budgets boosted financial performance in the more  uncertain (changing and unpredictable) post-television environment  of 1951-65.  The resource-based view of the firm provides a useful complement to  Porter's (1980) well-known structural perspective of strategy. This view shifts  the emphasis from the competitive environment of firms to the resources  that firms have developed to compete in that environment. Unfortunately,  although it has generated a great deal of conceptualizing (see reviews by  Black and Boal [1994] and Peteraf [1993]), the resource-based view is just  beginning to occasion systematic empirical study (Collis, 1991; Henderson &  Cockburn, 1994; Montgomery & Wernerfelt, 1988; McGrath, MacMillan, &  Venkatraman, 1995). Thus, the concept of resources remains an amorphous  one that is rarely operationally defined or tested for its performance implica-  tions in different competitive environments.  In the interests of testing and advancing the application of the resource-  based view, this research develops the distinction between property-based  and knowledge-based resources. We argue that the former are likely to con-  tribute most to performance in stable and predictable settings, whereas the  latter will be of the greatest utility in uncertain-that is, changing and unpre-  dictable-environments (Miller, 1988; Thompson, 1967). Indeed, in this arti-  cle we attempt to move from a resource-based "view" toward a "theory" by  progressing from description to testable prediction. A view is a product  We would like to acknowledge the helpful suggestions of Ming-Jer Chen, Steve Zyglido-  poulos, and two anonymous reviewers.  519 This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:41:39 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  520  Academy of Management Journal  June  of evocative description, but theory demands the formulation of falsifiable  propositions.  THE NATURE OF RESOURCES  According to Wernerfelt, resources can include "anything that might be  thought of as a strength or weakness of a given firm" and so "could be defined  as those [tangible and intangible assets] which are tied semipermanently to  the firm" (1984: 172). Resources are said to confer enduring competitive  advantages to a firm to the extent that they are rare or hard to imitate, have  no direct substitutes, and enable companies to pursue opportunities or avoid  threats (Barney, 1991). The last attribute is the most obvious: resources must  have some value-some capacity to generate profits or prevent losses. But  if all other firms have them, resources will be unable to contribute to superior  returns: their general availability will neutralize any special advantage. And  for the same reason, readily available substitutes for a resource will also  nullify its value. Thus, resources must be difficult to create, buy, substitute,  or imitate. This last point is central to the arguments of the resource-based  view (Barney, 1991; Lippman & Rumelt, 1982; Peteraf, 1993). Unusual returns  cannot be obtained when competitors can copy each other. Thus, the scope  of this study will be limited strictly to nonimitable resources.  Clearly, there are many resources that may meet these criteria, albeit  with differing effectiveness under different circumstances: important patents  or copyrights, brand names, prime distribution locations, exclusive contracts  for unique factors of production, subtle technical and creative talents, and  skills at collaboration or coordination (Black & Boal, 1994).  There are a number of ways in which the resource-based view can be  further developed. First, it may be useful to make some basic distinctions  among the types of organizational resources that can generate unusual eco-  nomic returns. By specifying the distinctive advantages of different types of  resources, it may be possible to add precision to the research. Such distinc-  tions will help avoid vague inferences that impute value to a firm's resources  simply because it has performed well (cf. Black & Boal, 1994; Fiol, 1991).  Second, to complement its internal focus, the resource-based view needs  to delineate the external environments in which different kinds of resources  would be most productive. Just as contingency theory attempts to relate  structures and strategies to the contexts in which they are most appropriate  (Burns & Stalker, 1961; Thompson, 1967), so too must the resource-based  view begin to consider the contexts within which various kinds of resources  will have the best influence on performance (Amit & Schoemaker, 1993).  According to Porter, "Resources are only meaningful in the context of per-  forming certain activities to achieve certain competitive advantages. The  competitive value of resources can be enhanced or eliminated by changes  in technology, competitor behavior, or buyer needs which an inward focus  on resources will overlook" (1991: 108).

Such studies, although  growing in number (cf. Henderson & Cockburn, 1994; McGrath et al., 1995;  Montgomery & Wernerfelt, 1988; Robins & Wiersema, 1995), remain too rare,  perhaps because of the difficulties of pinning down the predictions of the  resource-based view and even of operationally defining the notion of re-  sources (Black & Boal, 1994; Fiol, 1991; Miller, 1996; Peteraf, 1993).  This research begins to address each of these tasks. First, we derive  a predictive classification that distinguishes between property-based and  knowledge-based resources. Second, we argue that the performance implica-  tions each of these resources will differ in predictable as opposed to uncertain  environments. Third, in order to test these notions, we undertook a longitudi-  nal study of the seven major Hollywood film studios during two very different  eras: the first, one of great stability and predictability, and the second, one  of much upheaval, change, and uncertainty.  THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK  Categorizing Resources  Several researchers have attempted to derive resource categorization  schemes. Barney (1991) suggested that resources could be grouped into physi-  cal, human, and capital categories. Grant (1991) added to these financial,  technological, and reputational resources. Although very useful for the pur-  poses for which they were designed, these categorizations bear no direct  relationship to Barney's (1991) initial criteria for utility, namely, value, rarity,  difficulty of imitation, and unavailability of substitutes. In this article we  revisit a pivotal one of these criteria-barriers to imitability-to develop our  own typology. Imitability may be an important predictor of performance as,  indeed, it is a central argument of the resource-based view that a firm can  obtain unusual returns only when other firms are unable to imitate its re-  sources (Barney, 1991; Lippman & Rumelt, 1982). Otherwise these resources  would be less rare or valuable, and substitutability would become irrelevant.  Property-Based Versus Knowledge-Based Resources  There appear to be two fundamentally different bases of nonimitability  (Amit & Schoemaker, 1993; Hall, 1992, 1993; Lippman & Rumelt, 1982).  Some resources cannot be imitated because they are protected by property  rights, such as contracts, deeds of ownership, or patents. Other resources  are protected by knowledge barriers-by the fact that competitors do not  know how to imitate a firm's processes or skills.  Property-based resources. Property rights control "appropriable" re-  sources: those that tie up a specific and well-defined asset (Barney, 1991).  When a company has exclusive ownership of a valuable resource that cannot  be legally imitated by rivals, it controls that resource. It can thereby obtain  superior returns until the market changes to devalue the resource. Any rival  wishing to obtain the resource will have to pay the discounted future value This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:41:39 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  522  Academy of Management Journal  June  of its expected economic returns. Examples of property-based resources are  enforceable long-term contracts that monopolize scarce factors of production,  embody exclusive rights to a valuable technology, or tie up channels of  distribution. Property-based resources apply to a specific product or process.  And many such resources buffer an organization from competition by creat-  ing and protecting assets that are not available to rivals-at least not under  equally favorable terms (Black & Boal, 1994: 134). Typically, it is only the  fortunate or insightful firms that are able to gain control over valuable  property-based resources before their full value is publicly known.  Most competitors will be aware of the value of a rival's property-based  resources, and they may even have the knowledge to duplicate these re-  sources. But they either lack the legal right or the historical endowment to  imitate successfully. Indeed, it might be argued that in order for property-  based resources to generate unusual economic rents, they require protection  from exclusionary legal contracts, trade restrictions, or first-mover preemp-  tion (Conner, 1991; Grant, 1991).  Knowledge-based resources. Many valuable resources are protected from  imitation not by property rights but by knowledge barriers. They cannot be  imitated by competitors because they are subtle and hard to understand-  because they involve talents that are elusive and whose connection with  results is difficult to discern (Lippman & Rumelt, 1982). Knowledge-based  resources often take the form of particular skills: technical, creative, and  collaborative. For example, some firms have the technical and creative exper-  tise to develop competitive products and market them successfully. Others  may have the collaborative or integrative skills that help experts to work  and learn together very effectively (Fiol, 1991; Hall, 1993; Itami, 1987; Lado &  Wilson, 1994).  Knowledge-based resources allow organizations to succeed not by mar-  ket control or by precluding competition, but by giving firms the skills to  adapt their products to market needs and to deal with competitive challenges.  Economic rents accrue to such skills in part because rivals are ignorant of  why a firm is so successful. It is often hard to know, for example, what goes  into a rival's creativity or teamwork that makes it so effective. Such resources  may have what Lippman and Rumelt (1982) called "uncertain imitability":  they are protected from imitation not by legal or financial barriers, but by  knowledge barriers. The protection of knowledge barriers is not perfect-it  may be possible for competitors to develop similar knowledge and talent.  But this normally takes time, and by then, a firm may have gone on to  develop its skills further and to learn to use them in different ways (Lado &  Wilson, 1994).  Contrasts. The respective advantages of property-based and knowledge-  based resources are quite different. Property rights allow a firm to control  the resources it needs to gain a competitive edge. They may, for example,  tie up advantageous sources of supply, keeping them out of competitors'  hands. Such control of a specific asset, in effect, is the only source of value  for property-based resources. Knowledge-based resources typically are better This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:41:39 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1996  Miller and Shamsie  523  designed to respond and adapt to the challenges facing an organization.  Creative skills, for instance, can be used to interpret customer desires and  respond to emerging market trends. Of course, property- and knowledge-  based resources are not always independent, as the latter may sometimes be  used to develop or procure the former.  A key theme of this article is that the benefits of property-based resources  are quite specific and fixed and thus, the resources are appropriate mostly  for the environment for which they were developed. For example, a process  patent ceases to have value when it has been superseded by a new process;  a prized location becomes useless when customers move away. In short, a  particular property right stops being valuable when the market no longer  values the property. Thus, when the environment changes, property-based  resources may lose their advantage. This is especially true if the environment  alters in ways that could not have been predicted when the property was  developed or acquired or when the fixed contract was made (Geroski &  Vlassopoulos, 1991). Thus, an uncertain environment-one that is changing  and unpredictable-is the enemy of property-based resources.  Knowledge-based resources, on the other hand, often tend to be less  specific and more flexible. For example, a creative design team can invent  products to meet an assortment of market needs. Such resources can help a  firm respond to a larger number of contingencies (Lado & Wilson, 1994). Many  knowledge-based resources are in fact designed to cope with environmental  change. Unfortunately, these resources are not protected by law from imita-  tion, and many are unduly expensive in predictable settings, where more  routine but far cheaper response mechanisms can be equally effective. Also,  in placid environments, a firm's knowledge may evolve so slowly as to be  subject to imitation by rivals. In short, property-based resources will be of  the greatest utility in stable or predictable environments, whereas knowledge-  based resources will be most useful in uncertain, that is, changing and unpre-  dictable, environments.  HYPOTHESES  In order to establish the robustness of our distinction between property-  based and knowledge-based resources, we will examine two varieties of each  category: discrete resources and bundled, or systemic, resources. Discrete  resources stand alone and have value more or less independent of their  organizational contexts. Exclusive contracts or technical skills are examples  of such resources. Systemic resources, on the other hand, have value because  their components are part of a network or system. Outlets in an integrated  distribution network or skills within a well-coordinated team, for instance,  are especially valuable within the context of that system (Amit & Schoemaker,  1993). Stores in a retail chain may have extra value precisely because they  benefit from a national brand name and economies of standardization, promo-  tion, and administration. Scientists may be especially productive because of  the multidisciplinary synergies and team skills they develop with their co-  workers within the context of their organizations. Brumagin (1994) contrasted This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:41:39 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  524  Academy of Management Journal  June  discrete and systemic resources, calling them respectively elementary and  higher-level resources, and Black and Boal (1994) referred to traits versus  configurations.  Discrete Property-Based Resources  Discrete property-based resources may take the form of ownership rights  or legal agreements that give an organization control over scarce and valuable  inputs, facilities, locations, or patents. Some resources, for example, take the  form of leases or contracts that give companies exclusive access to especially  valuable materials or to inputs of exceptionally low cost. Such resources are  protected by rule of law. And typically, the utility of any exclusive right or  contract will be a function of the ease and costs of its enforcement as well  as of its duration (Conner, 1991: 138).  Of course, not all firms can obtain such lucrative resources. The fortunate  ones may be those that were first to discover value in a resource or gain  access to it, or that once had the power to negotiate favorable long-term  agreements (Lieberman & Montgomery, 1988). As most discrete resources  are independent of one another, a firm stands to gain by amassing as many  of these as it can, subject of course to their marginal costs and benefits. For  example, some companies tie up so many sources of supply that their rivals  must settle for inferior substitutes.  Because discrete property-based resources are primarily designed to pro-  vide an organization with a high degree of control, they are likely to be of  most value in stable or predictable settings where the objects of control  maintain their relevance. In such environments it is simpler to estimate the  life expectancy and thus the value of most properties, claims, and contracts. It  is also easiest there to plan for additional resource acquisition. Predictability  ensures that property-based resources will continue to buffer a firm from its  competition for quite some time (Wernerfelt & Karnani, 1987).  Where the environment is changing unpredictably, however, property-  based resources are in greater danger of obsolescence. A changing group  of competitors may devise new products or processes that nullify existing  resource advantages. Customer tastes that alter rapidly may have the same  effect. All such changes may be very difficult to foresee at the time of contract-  ing. Exclusive sources of supply, for example, may lose their value when  they are replaced by more up-to-date substitutes. Long-term leases on retail-  ing space may be more of a liability than an asset when the targeted customers  shift to another type of store or location (Geroski & Vlassopoulos, 1991).  Similarly, discrete resources that rely on contracts supported by laws and  statutes are in danger of obsolescence the moment these laws change.  Hypothesis 1: Discrete property-based resources will pro-  duce superior financial performance in predictable envi-  ronments but will not do so in uncertain environments.  Systemic Property-Based Resources  Some property-based resources are in the form of systems and their  interwoven components; these typically include physical facilities or equip- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:41:39 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1996  Miller and Shamsie  525  ment. By themselves, most concrete facilities are easily imitable: thus, much  of their value relies on their role within and their links to an integrated  system whose synergy is hard to duplicate (Barney, 1991; Black & Boal,  1994). This is true of some integrated supply, manufacturing, and distribution  systems. The units of a distribution network, for example, may be valuable  because of their connection with a steady source of supply or with economies  of administration and promotion engendered by a well-respected parent  company (Barney, 1991; Brumagin, 1994: 94).1  In the case of systemic resources, managers do not aim to tie up more  and more individual assets, but to enhance the range and comprehensiveness  of a pre-existing system. Resources are added not to substitute for existing  assets but rather, to strengthen a system or competence that is already in  place. For example, one might acquire more distributors or outlets to bolster  a distribution system (Lado, Boyd, & Wright, 1992: 86-87). The more elabo-  rate the system, the more market penetration it can provide, the more econom-  ically it can allocate marketing, administration, and even operating expenses,  and the more it can make use of an established brand image or reputation.  Like discrete property-based resources, systemic resources will be more  useful in predictable than in uncertain competitive environments. When an  environment is predictable, it is easier to appraise the value of systems and  to augment them in an orderly way with the aim of increasing the scope of  market control. Predictability also allows a firm to determine the steps that  it needs to take to fortify its system. Indeed, it is only when the environment  is predictable and the existing system is secure that it makes sense for a firm  to develop that system.  When the environment is changing unpredictably, however, managers  may be reluctant to build onto a system whose longevity is difficult to estimate  or that is at risk of becoming obsolete. For example, if distribution technology  changes unpredictably, one cannot build onto existing networks. And in an  uncertain environment in which clients' demands are ever-changing and  hard to anticipate, most property-based systems are threatened with obso-  lescense (Wernerfelt & Karnani, 1987). Here the useful life of systemic re-  sources may be short and hard to predict, and a firm may find itself controlling  assets that generate little revenue (Geroski & Vlassospoulos, 1991).  Hypothesis 2: Systemic property-based resources will pro-  duce superior financial performance in predictable envi-  ronments but will not do so in uncertain environments.  Of course, most fixed resources are eminently imitable. Superior mechanical equipment,  for example, can usually be copied, as can most processes that are well understood (Nelson &  Winter, 1982). Reed and DeFillippi claimed that "a competitor can simply observe site-embodied  performance effects and, through technological deduction, can deduce the same for physical  assets" (1990: 93). Competitors may then gain access to the personnel or capital needed to  develop or buy the desired asset (Conner, 1991). Such imitable fixed resources are not the focus  of resource-based theory and thus are beyond the scope of our study.

Discrete knowledge-based resources may take the form of spe-  cific technical, functional, and creative skills (Itami, 1987; Winter, 1987).  Such skills may be valuable because they are subject to uncertain imitability  (Lippman & Rumelt, 1982). It is often hard to discern just what it is about  these skills that generates economic returns or customer loyalty. Therefore,  competitors do not know what to buy or imitate. This advantage is protected  precisely because it is in some way ambiguous and mysterious, even to those  who possess it (Lado & Wilson, 1994; Reed & DeFillippi, 1990). As with  discrete property-based resources, firms can benefit from simultaneously  developing as many of these knowledge resources as possible. For example,  firms can at the same time pursue expertise in design, production, and mar-  keting.  Although unforeseeable changes in markets may render many property-  based resources obsolete, knowledge-based resources such as unusual cre-  ative and technical skills may remain viable under varying conditions. In-  deed, they may actually help a firm adapt its offerings to a changing environ-  ment (Wernerfelt & Karnani, 1987). Some creative skills are also quite flexible  as they apply to different outputs and environments. And this makes them  especially useful in a changing, uncertain setting. For example, where the  environment is particularly competitive and rivals are introducing many  new offerings, the skills of experts who can adapt and create better products  will be especially valuable.2  In a stable or predictable environment, firms may also benefit from dis-  crete skills. But these afford less effective, less efficient, and less secure  advantages than do discrete property-based resources. Where a firm can  enforce its legal property rights, it possesses almost perfect protection against  imitation. This is not true of the protection given by knowledge, which can  be lost, especially in stable settings in which knowledge and its application  evolve more slowly and are thus easier to copy. Moreover, the high costs of  retaining very talented employees may not produce much net benefit in  stable contexts that do not demand the full exploitation of their unusual  abilities. Predictable settings do not typically call for as deep or extensive a  set of skills for product or process innovation and adaptation as do uncertain  and changing environments (Miller, 1988; Miller & Friesen, 1984).  Hypothesis 3: Discrete knowledge-based resources will  produce superiorfinancial performance in uncertain envi-  ronments but will not do so in predictable environments.  2 A changing environment may itself confer uncertain imitability on some flexible resources.  In uncertain settings, the situations facing each firm are constantly varying, as are the organiza-  tional processes used to compete. It would be difficult, then, for firms to imitate the superior  talents of a competitor simply because those talents are forever being manifested in different  ways.

Some organizations not only have a depth of technical, func-  tional, and creative expertise but are also adept at integrating and coordinat-  ing that expertise. They invest in team-building and collaborative efforts that  promote adaptation and flexibility. Indeed, it is not just skills in any one  domain, but rather, the way skills from several domains complement one  another in a team, that gives many firms their competitive advantage (Hall,  1993; Itami, 1987; Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1990; Winter, 1987).  Collaborative skills are most subject to uncertain imitability (Hall, 1993;  Peteraf, 1993: 183). According to Reed and DeFillippi, "ambiguity may be  derived from the complexity of skills and/or resource interactions within  competencies and from interaction between competencies" (1990: 93). There  is much subtlety in effective teamwork. The systemic nature of team and  coordinative skills makes them especially firm-specific-more valuable to a  firm than to its competitors (Dierickx & Cool, 1989: 1505). Team talents,  therefore, are difficult for rivals to steal as they rely on the particular infra-  structure, history, and collective experience of a specific organization.  Collaborative skills typically do not develop through programmed or  routine activity. Instead, they require nurturing from a history of challenging  product development projects. These long-term projects force specialists  from different parts of an organization to work together intensively on a  complex set of problems. And such interaction broadens both the technical  and social knowledge of organizational actors and promotes ever more effec-  tive collaboration (Itami, 1987; Schmookler, 1966).  The above arguments suggest that team building is apt to be more neces-  sary, more rewarding, and perhaps even more likely in uncertain than in  predictable environments (Hall, 1993; Porter, 1985). Collaborative talents are  robust-they apply to a wide variety of situations and products. In contrast  with fixed routines, teamwork enables companies to handle complex and  changing contingencies (Thompson, 1967). Moreover, "unlike physical  assets, competencies do not deteriorate as they are applied and shared. . . .  They grow" (Prahalad & Hamel, 1990: 82). Collaborative skills not only  remain useful under changing environments, they also help firms to adapt  and develop new products for evolving markets (Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967;  Thompson, 1967). Indeed, the flexibility born of multifunctional collabora-  tion will help firms to respond quickly to market changes and challenges  (Mahoney & Pandian, 1992; Wernerfelt & Karnani, 1987).  In stable environments, on the other hand, the returns to collaborative  and adaptive skills may be small. Where tasks are unvarying, coordination  can be routinized very efficiently, and thus coordinative or team skills will  be less important (Thompson, 1967). Moreover, when customer tastes and  rivals' strategies are stable, there is little need to constantly redesign or adapt  products. In such contexts, the modest benefits of intensive collaboration  may not justify the costs.

Table 1 summarizes our analytical framework.  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  Sample and Historical Eras  Our sample consisted of the seven major Hollywood film studios from  1936 through 1965. These studios included MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox,  Warner Brothers, Paramount, United Artists, Universal, and Columbia. Al-  though United had few production facilities, it helped finance and distribute  movies by independent producers, some of whom had part ownership in  the company. The only other potential major, RKO, was deleted from the  sample because it terminated operations in 1956, a full nine years before the  end of our study. Prior to that, RKO had gone through frequent reorganiza-  tions and changes in form and management (Lasky, 1989).  Our study encompasses two rather different periods: one of stability,  lasting from about 1936 to 1950, and another of challenging uncertainty,  occurring between 1951 and 1965. Although uncertainty was not the only  difference between the two eras, respected industry scholars such as Balio  (1985), Gomery (1991), and Mast (1992) have attested that it was an important  one. By conducting separate analyses for the two eras, we hoped to show  the differential utility of property- and knowledge-based resources in stable  and uncertain contexts.

Before then, there had been growing  consolidation in the film industry (Bordwell, Staiger, & Thompson, 1985:  403). But the last significant merger took place between Fox and Twentieth  Century in 1935. Around the same time, Paramount reemerged from bank-  ruptcy as a new organization. Thus, by 1936 the industry had matured into  the oligopoly that became known as the studio system. And for the next  dozen years or so, demand for films remained strong, reflected both by stable  patterns of attendance-80 to 90 million admissions per week throughout  the entire period-and by gradually increasing box office revenues (Stein-  berg, 1980). Also, stable customer preferences meant that studios could pre-  dict that particular stars, directors, and genres of films would remain popular  for a considerable time (Bohn, Stromgren, & Johnson, 1978; Gomery, 1991).  Thus, the production process became quite routine as similar crews worked  together under the supervision of a single production head or a few key  producers (Staiger, 1985: 320).  All of the studios of the day developed their own stables of talent by  signing a wide variety of stars to exclusive, long-term contracts. Four of the  major studios also owned or leased theaters in significant locations across  the country. Collectively, the majors controlled fewer than 3,000 theaters of  the 18,000 operating nationwide. These, however, included the preponder-  ance of first-run cinemas in big cities that drew 75 percent of the national  box office (Balio, 1985: 255). Cinemas not associated with the major studios  were mostly in small towns and showed second-run films. Because many  studios controlled their stars and were guaranteed distribution for their films  via their theaters, they were able to plan well in advance a steady stream of  film offerings (Gomery, 1991; Whitney, 1982). Stable demand brought a very  reasonable chance of success, and control over theaters made sure all of a  studio's films would have an audience.  The period from the early 1950s to the mid 1960s brought about signifi-  cant transformations in the industry that greatly enhanced the level of uncer-  tainty (Balio, 1985; Mast, 1992). By 1950, television sets had entered 25  percent of homes, and this penetration had doubled to 50 percent by 1952.  As a result, cinema attendance declined significantly from 1949 to 1953 and  then stabilized at only about 40 to 50 million admissions per week. Firms  began groping to find new ways to attract moviegoers and soon started to  differentiate their films from television programs by making grander and  more lavish productions (Mast, 1992: 275; Stuart, 1982: 295). They experi-  mented with new techniques involving color film, wide screens, and stereo-  phonic sound. Thus, the technical and creative skills of studios became ever  more important as growing entertainment alternatives made moviegoers more  discriminating. Also, cycles of popularity had became much shorter as jaded  audiences quickly grew tired of particular genres or stars (Bohn et al., 1978;  Gomery, 1991). Box office failures became common as falling demand made  studios compete fiercely for increasingly unpredictable audiences.

In response, some studios began to search for the few key  stars, directors, or producers who could reduce the risks of their big budget  films (Kindem, 1982: 88). But now they were less apt to hire such people  on a permanent basis as the popularity of talent could be rapidly eroded and  because talent would be underutilized with the few films made. As a result,  the coordinative skills needed to assemble and direct nonpermanent cast  members in very complex productions became invaluable (Mast, 1992;  Staiger, 1985). This was especially true as the complexity and variety of  productions increased.  To contribute further to this climate of uncertainty, the studios began  to lose control over their distribution outlets and their stars. Although the  major studios were first targeted by antitrust proceedings in the late 1930s,  the first truly effective steps to reduce their power were only taken in the  late 1940s. These culminated in a ruling by the U.S. Justice Department in  1948 that ultimately forced the majors to sell off their theaters by the late  1950s. But by then the movement of the population to the suburbs had  already reduced the value of many of the studios' downtown theaters (Mast,  1992: 277). This declining control over distribution increased the burden on  the studios to produce only those films that would have the best chance  of being distributed-a great challenge in the more discriminating market  (Whitney, 1982).  In the face of their reduced output, the studios began gradually to aban-  don the practice of signing stars to exclusive contracts, and in fact drastically  cut back on the number of stars during the late 1950s. These reductions gave  studios less control over a key production factor. Moreover, given the more  rapidly changing customer tastes, stars tended to have shorter productive  lives, while at the same time, stars' independence from studio contracts bid  up their value more quickly (Kindem 1982).  To recap, the era from 1936 to 1950 was one of much stability, but 1951  to 1965 witnessed a far more uncertain (that is, changing and unpredictable)  environment. We terminated our period of analysis in 1965, as after that  conglomerates began to buy up many of the studios. These purchases in large  part occurred because so many studios had fallen in value, and some were  approaching bankruptcy. Also, by the late 1960s the studio system was re-  placed by one dominated by independent producers and directors (Bohn et  al., 1978).  In order to confirm these differences in uncertainty between the two  periods, we assessed year-to-year industry stability in revenues, market  shares, and profits: this volatility was reflected by the correlation between  a firm's results in year t and its results in year t - 1 for each of the eras. For  the first era, the interyear correlation coefficients for revenues, market share  and profits were .97, .97, and .80; for the second era, the numbers were .78,  .70, and .31. Clearly, the first era shows greater stability among these measures  than the second period (p < .10, < .05, and < .01, respectively).

In part this  was because of more frequent flops at the box office and because of the more  pressing need to introduce new kinds of films.  Although industry concentration ratios remained about the same for  both periods, the two eras differed greatly in uncertainty. This difference  was due to declining demand, which resulted in greater rivalry for audiences,  more fickle and rapidly changing customer tastes, increased emphasis on  fewer, larger, and more risky film projects, and a loss of control over factor  inputs and distribution. These qualitative contrasts seemed to be mirrored  by our quantitative indicators. Of course, because industry environments are  so multifaceted, our two eras no doubt also vary in aspects other than uncer-  tainty.  Variables  Discrete property-based resources. In the film industry, long-term con-  tracts for stars represented a key discrete property-based resource (Kindem,  1982). Each studio tried to develop its own pool of potential stars from among  individuals who were recruited early in their careers at relatively low costs.  Even during the peak years of moviegoing, fewer than a hundred contracts  controlled stars who accounted for the lion's share of box office revenues.  Studios thus competed with each other to obtain exclusive long-term (typi-  cally, seven-year) contracts with such stars (Shipman, 1979). Often, stars  were signed simply to prevent other studios from being able to benefit from  their talents. If rival studios wanted to borrow a star, they would have to  pay a substantial price and sometimes even split profits with the studio that  held the star's contract. Stars who threatened to break a contract would  usually be punished by being given poor roles or by banishment from the  industry (Huettig, 1985: 253).  We obtained data on the number of long-term contracts with stars that  were held by each studio or its producers for each of the years studied. The  sources of these data were two volumes by Shipman (1972, 1979) containing  biographical profiles of all the stars who had appeared in any significant  films in either leading or supporting roles. These biographies were all coded  individually to link the relevant stars to all the major studios for every year  of the study. All contracts for stars that ran for four or more years during  the period between 1936 and 1965 were included in the data.  Systemic property-based resources. Some might argue that studio plant  and equipment represent valuable discrete resources. But resource-based  theorists would maintain that these assets are imitable and purchasable and  thus cannot confer any true competitive advantage (Conner, 1991). Every  one of the major studios either owned or leased production lots, props, sets,  and camera equipment (Huettig, 1985). In fact, some of these studios even  rented out their facilities and equipment to producers who could not afford  to buy them.

Well-situated theaters that were either owned or  leased long-term by the studios afforded control over valuable distribution  outlets. Indeed, theaters owned by the studios were almost all situated in  prime locations: collectively, the studios owned over 70 percent of the the-  aters located in cities of over 100,000 people (Whitney, 1982: 166). Inferior  locations in rural communities were left to the independent cinemas. Also,  studios tended each to concentrate their theaters in different cities from one  another to reduce direct competition. More important, a network of theaters  provided studios with an extensive and compliant showcase for films and  denied competitors equal access to films and customers (Conant, 1960). The  close integration of a studio and its theaters ensured that a firm's own cinemas  were given a steady supply of top-ranking films while independents were  left with second-run movies. A network of theaters also gave studios reliable  outlets for all of the films they produced. In addition, studio-owned theaters  benefited from parent support of advertising, promotion, and administration,  and economies of operation were effected by allocating costs across a large  network of cinemas. Even popcorn purchases were centralized. The result  was that theaters controlled by the studios averaged annual revenues that  were 15 times those of the independents (Balio, 1985: 255). Theaters, then,  were made more valuable through their integration into a network and their  association with studios. Such systemic asset specificity and the control of  key locations made theaters an especially hard-to-copy resource (Black &  Boal, 1994).  We obtained information on the number of domestic theaters owned or  under long-term lease for each studio for each year from figures provided in  Moody's Industrial Manuals.  Discrete knowledge-based resources. In the film industry, the discrete  knowledge-based resources of each studio lie in the creative and technical  skills that it has been able to build up. Each studio tried to develop unique  abilities in various areas of film production that it could use to differentiate  its films from those produced by its competitors (Mast, 1992: 230-231). These  diverse skills included expertise in script development, set design, direction,  camera work, sound, and editing. Studios created large pools of skilled indi-  viduals that they could draw upon to work on the many films that they  produced each year. MGM, the largest studio, developed a workforce of 6,000  skilled employees distributed among 27 departments (Balio, 1985: 264).  Many studios tried to develop reputations around their various technical  skills in order to attract more talent. The level of these skills is in part  reflected by the number of Academy Awards that a studio won each year.  The majority of such skills were in creative and technical categories such  as screenplay, cinematography, editing, costumes, set design, and sound.  Although these awards were given to individuals of exceptional ability, they  also reflected a studio's success in recruiting, developing, and supporting  talent. We gathered data on the percentage of Academy Awards that were  won annually by each studio. The primary source for this data was a complete This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:41:39 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1996  Miller and Shamsie  533  listing of Academy Awards published by Michael (1968). It might be argued  that Academy Awards also represent an outcome measure of performance:  but for the purposes of this study we used awards to infer the existence of  talent that might later enhance financial returns.  Systemic knowledge-based resources. Although studios could try to  build discrete abilities, they also needed to integrate these by developing  coordinative team skills (Balio, 1985). This was especially true in the second  era, when studios had to assemble large groups of temporary employees who  had little experience working together to collaborate on each complex, big-  budget project. Such large, long-term projects with huge casts and crews  operating on elaborate sets required studios to learn a great deal about how  to get people to work together effectively. Studios with a history of such  large projects were most apt to learn the coordinative and integrative skills  needed for success (Staiger, 1985: 300-336; Stuart, 1982: 294; Robins, 1993).  This process was a prime example of learning by doing.  Team, coordinative, or integrative ability therefore may be reflected,  albeit imperfectly, by a studio's former investments in complex, large-scale  film projects. Large projects develop coordinative skills because they require  the management of many talents and resources from many specialties over  long periods of time (Stuart, 1982: 295-296). A history of having worked on  such major films promotes new learning about project management; it also  creates team synergies that can be used to good effect in subsequent projects  (Robins, 1993).  The scale and complexity of past projects is reflected in the last two  years' average production costs per film (Huettig, 1985: 306). We obtained this  data on film costs and producers' fees from the annual financial statements of  each studio. We averaged production costs for the films that had been released  by the studio over the previous two years to reflect the recent history of  expenditures.  Trends in demand. The annual level of demand is a key index of industry  health that can influence performance. Therefore, all of our analyses included  a control variable that measured the percentage of household recreational  spending devoted to movie attendance. These data were obtained from the  U.S. Department of Commerce, Social and Economic Statistics Administra-  tion (Steinberg, 1980).  Performance indexes. There are many alternative indexes of economic  returns-return on assets, return on sales, operating profits, market share,  and even total revenues. For purposes of this study, we decided to look at  a variety of financial performance indexes in order to establish the range  and robustness of our findings.  We could not use return on asset measures because of differences in the  asset reporting and composition of the film companies. Some studios were  diversified and did not segregate assets from nonfilm businesses in their  financial reports; United Artists did not own any production facilities. We  did, however, compute annual return on sales, both with and without theater  revenues and profits. We also examined operating profits, but without the This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:41:39 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  534  Academy of Management Journal  June  theater operations. We did not measure operating profits with theaters as  this would have artificially penalized and rendered noncomparable the stu-  dios that did not own any theaters. Finally, we included the domestic market  share figures for each of the studios. In every instance, we were concerned  only with the revenues and profits from a studio's film business.  Data on revenues and profits for each studio were obtained from Moody's  Industrial Manual and from company financial reports. For studios that  owned theaters, separate revenue and profit figures were obtained for the  production and distribution of films and for the operation of theaters. Reve-  nues and profits were also adjusted for any television business reported.  Annual market share data for each studio were derived from its revenues as  a percentage of total box office receipts for the year. This information was  obtained from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Socialsand Economics and  Statistics Administration.  Analyses  The data consisted of 30 years of observations across seven studios.  Separate analyses were conducted for the predictable (through 1950) and  uncertain (1951 onwards) periods. Each of the two periods consisted of 14  years, after one year per era was lost as a result of the lagging and averaging  of variables. Given the longitudinal nature of our study, it was necessary to  transform our data to avoid any problems of autocorrelation and hetero-  scedasticity. To do this transformation, we used pooled time series cross-  sectional analyses (Kmenta, 1986: 616-625). This procedure first adjusts the  data for autocorrelation using the Prais-Winsten (1954) iterative transforma-  tion. To establish the adequacy of a first-order autocorrelation adjustment,  we inspected the correlograms for the analyses. These declined rapidly at  higher lags, confirming both the stationarity of the time series process and  the adequacy of a first-order correction. Separate autocorrelation adjustments  were done for each firm.  A second transformation of the data was then employed to correct for  heteroscedasticity. We divided the dependent and independent variables  by the firm-specific error variances obtained from the regressions on the  autocorrelation-corrected data. The twice-transformed data could then be  pooled and analyzed using ordinary-least-squares regression analysis (cf.  Judge et al., 1988: Section 11.5; Sayrs, 1989).  To avoid specification error in the models, all of the analyses incorpo-  rated measures of performance in the prior (t - 1) period. Because of the  inclusion of this lagged dependent variable, we employed Durbin's H test  to ensure an absence of bias in the estimates of the residuals (Judge et al., 1988:  401). Plots of residuals were inspected to confirm the absence of patterns due  to heteroscedasticity or autocorrelation (Sayrs, 1989). We also ascertained  that multicollinearity was not a problem in our analyses using the diagnostics  of Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch (1980). Finally, to establish that the results were  not overly sensitive to our choice of ending dates, we reanalyzed the data after  changing the termination date from 1965 to 1959. The results did not alter.

The hypotheses were tested using the autoregressive  heteroscedastic models of Tables 4 and 5.  It is worth examining some basic contrasts between the two eras. First,  Table 2 shows that consumer spending on films as a percentage of annual  entertainment budgets declined from 19.5 percent in the first period to 6.6  percent in the second. Second, profitability was lower in the second than in  the first period (p < .02). Third, as we indicated before, there are striking  differences between the two eras (compare Tables 4 and 5) in the interyear  relationships of all the performance variables. The earlier, more predictable  era shows strong relationships between all performance measures and their  lagged values, thereby suggesting stability in the competitive environment.  By contrast, the second, more uncertain era produced much lower interyear  correlations for the performance variables, substantiating the notion that the  competitive environment had become more uncertain. Thus, these results  again appear to bear out our characterization of the two periods as, respec-  tively, stable and uncertain.  Property-Based Resources  Hypothesis 1 suggested that discrete property-based resources such as  long-term contracts for movie stars would help performance in predictable  settings but not in uncertain settings. This hypothesis was supported for all  four of the performance measures: return on sales with and without theaters,  profits, and market share. Tables 4 and 5 indicate that long-term contracts  for stars contributed broadly to performance in the early, predictable era,  but not in the uncertain era. These results support the utility of long-term  TABLE 2  Descriptive Statistics  1936-50 1951-65  Variables Mean s.d. Mean s.d.

By contrast, during the uncertain era, long-term contracts  with stars became more risky in part because of the increasingly fickle tastes  of moviegoers.  As we noted, by the late 1950s, studios began to abandon the system of  long-term contracts. Because of this change, our analyses of the second,  uncertain era may have been biased-but mainly in the years after 1958,  when the number of stars under contract had begun to decline precipitously.  To assess this bias, we reran the analyses whose results are shown in Table  5 using only the years 1951-58. The earlier results were replicated: stars did  not relate to any index of performance in the uncertain era.  According to Hypothesis 2, systemic property-based resources, such as  control over theaters, and thus over film distribution, would also contrib-  ute to financial performance-again in predictable but not in uncertain con-  texts. Tables 4 and 5 indicate that this hypothesis was borne out for three  of the four performance measures: the two return on sales indexes and This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:41:39 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1996  Miller and Shamsie  537  Autoregressive-Heteroscedastic Models, Early Era: 1936-50  TABLE 4  Return on Sales  Without With Market  Resources Theaters Theaters Profits Share  Property-based  Stars under long-term  contract .18** .12* .18* .18***  Theaters .I1t .18** .06 .07*  Knowledge-based  Academy Awards -.01 -.02 .02 .03  History of per-film pro-  duction costs -.12t -.llt -.00 -.07t  Controls  Lagged dependent variable .57*** .69*** .57*** .80***  Movies as percentage of  entertainment budget .16* .11* .14** -.07**  Buse R2 .60 .73 .62 .96  F 23.1 40.2 24.3 424.6  p .000 .000 .000 .000  tp < .10  *p < .05  **p < .01  ***p < .001  Autoregressive-Heteroscedastic Models, Late Era: 1951-65  TABLE 5  Return on Sales  Without With Market  Resources Theatres Theatres Profits Share  Property-based  Stars under long-term  contract -.04 -.01 -.02 .09  Theaters .05 -.02 .04 -.04  Knowledge-based  Academy Awards .06* .06* .10** .23***  History of per-film  production costs .11* .12* .27*** .07  Controls  Lagged dependent variable .31** .29** .17** .69***  Movies as percentage of  entertainment budget .16* .16* .32*** -.01  Buse R2 .23 .22 .39 .75  F 4.6 4.2 9.8 46.0  p .05 .05 .002 .000  *p < .05  **p < .01  ***p < .001 This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:41:39 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  538  Academy of Management Journal  June  market share. Operating profits did not relate to theater ownership, however,  perhaps because of the lower rental charges that studios levied against their  theaters (Conant, 1960: 134-135; Huettig, 1985: 296-297). These results con-  firm the value of theaters during the earlier, more predictable era when  the theaters served as outlets for a studio's own movies. During the second  era, as demand became more selective and erratic, theaters became less valu-  able.  In examining results for the later, uncertain era, it is important to remem-  ber that studios divested themselves of theaters during this period because  of pressure from the U.S. Department of Justice (the number of theaters  controlled by the majors went from 2,871 in 1936, to 3,084 in 1949, to 1,156  in 1953). By 1959, all studios had disposed of their theaters. To establish  whether the impact of theater control on performance was higher before that  date, we dropped the years 1959 to 1965 from our analyses of the second  era. As before, and as predicted, all results remained nonsignificant. It is  encouraging that our findings remained stable even after we changed the  termination date of the analyses from 1965 to 1959. Still, given the sharp  reduction in the number of theaters controlled during the uncertain second  era, these last results must be interpreted with caution.  Knowledge-Based Resources  Hypothesis 3 states that discrete knowledge-based resources such as  technical and creative skills-here reflected by the Academy Awards a studio  earned-would contribute to financial performance in uncertain environ-  ments but not in predictable environments. This hypothesis was borne out for  all four indexes of performance: that is, all predicted relationships attained  significance in the uncertain era, none in the predictable era.  It seems that during the predictable era, when audiences were hungry  for film entertainment and less discriminating in their viewing preferences,  excellent or distinctive productions contributed little to economic returns.  However, with the advent of television, movies stood a better chance of  success if they had something special to offer: excellent acting or directing,  good screenplay, and captivating cinematography and musical scores (Mast,  1992: 288-289).  Hypothesis 4 concerns systemic knowledge-based resources such as the  coordinative and collaborative skills produced by a history of big, long, and  complex film projects. These skills were expected to contribute to financial  performance in uncertain environments but not in predictable ones. Our  surrogate measure for a history of such collaborative projects, average produc-  tion budgets per film for the prior two years, correlated with all of our  performance measures, save market share, during the later, uncertain era  (p < .05). The results were strikingly different for the earlier, predictable  period when returns on sales bore significantly negative relationships with  production budgets. High production costs appeared to represent an expendi- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Wed, 01 Feb 2017 19:41:39 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1996  Miller and Shamsie  539  ture during this early period that was simply not justified by the market re-  sponse.  In the early period, the majority of films were produced quickly and  cheaply in order to meet a constant and relatively undiscriminating demand.  Smaller projects did not demand great integrative skills; centralized film-  making made coordination easy; and mega-films did not justify their higher  expenses in an easy-to-please market. In the later, more uncertain period,  by contrast, films required bigger investments in both development and  execution in order to stand out and do well. These distinctive projects  required elaborate and expensive coordinative efforts among a wide range of  specialists, many of whom were hired by the studios only for the dura-  tion of the project. Consequently, coordinative skills that were developed  through recent experience with bigger film projects tended to yield superior  returns.  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  For the past two decades, the field of management strategy has been  much influenced by concepts and insights from the literature on economics  and industrial organization (Rumelt, Schendel, & Teece, 1991). Indeed,  the resource-based view is itself firmly rooted in economic notions of  market power and competition (Conner, 1991). Unfortunately, there remains  much to be done to test empirically the relevance of some economic  notions for firm performance, and this is true as well of the resource-  based view. Although there are long lists of candidates for valuable  resources, there have been very few efforts to establish systematically if,  when, and how these resources influence financial performance. Perhaps  more important, the literature contains many generalizations about the  merits of some resources, conjectures that often fail to consider the contexts  within which these resources might be of value to an organization. Thus,  after years of interesting conceptual work, we are still at an early stage  in knowing what constitutes a valuable resource, why, and when (Amit &  Schoemaker, 1993).  This article endeavors to make some progress in those directions. It  shows that both property- and knowledge-based resources that are hard to  buy or imitate contributed to performance: to returns on sales, operating  profits, and market share. However, the environmental context was all-  important in conditioning these relationships. Periods of stability and pre-  dictability favored firms with property-based resources but did not reward  those with knowledge-based resources. Precisely the opposite was true for  periods of uncertainty, even though the sample of firms was identical. It  follows, then, that whether or not an asset can be considered a resource  will depend as much on the context enveloping an organization as on the  properties of the asset itself. It is misleading to attempt to define resources  independent of the tasks they are to serve and the environment within which  they must function (cf. Barney, 1991).

Static resources that are used for control usually demand institu-  tional or legal protection that is beyond the influence of a firm. Once this  protection lapses, or as soon as the environment changes to devalue the  resources, all competitive advantage is lost. This liability may not accrue to  the same degree to the more adaptable knowledge-based resources.  An auxiliary object of this research was to show how one might opera-  tionally define and measure various potentially valuable resources. It is, it  seems, possible to identify key resources for a particular industry and then  derive quantitative indicators that reflect, with greater or lesser accuracy, a  firm's wealth in such resources. Doing so is not a simple task, however.  Considerable ingenuity no doubt will be required of subsequent researchers  if they are to avoid trivial or tautological indexes, especially in assessing  elusive notions such as skills and learning.  This study, however, is just a beginning. And as such, it has its share  of shortcomings. First, it is limited to a single industry: research in other  industries will be needed to confirm the generality of its conclusions. Second,  we have focused on only four kinds of resources, albeit ones that have been  shown to be most relevant to the film industry. Further research will be  needed to examine the usefulness of this framework with other types of  resources. Third, there may have been environmental differences between  our two historical eras that have little to do with unpredictability or uncer-  tainty yet contribute to our findings on the differential superiority of our  categories of resources-in short, there may be alternative explanations for  our results. A final limitation is that in historical studies such as this, much  use has to be made of secondary sources and archival records. Use of such  sources leads to problems of data availability. In this analysis, for example,  historical reporting of assets was too aggregated to allow us to accurately  measure return on assets.  We hope that these shortcomings will spur others to initiate more refined  research into the resource-based view. And we are indeed pleased that many  of the notions of that view do seem to be important to the way organizations  must craft their strategies to succeed in different environments. Further re-  search might investigate whether tailoring resources to industry uncertainty  contributes to superior performance. Do knowledge-based resources have an  edge in turbulent industries such as software, semiconductors, and biotech-  nology? Are property-based resources more useful in stable sectors such as  mining, utilities, and industrial chemicals? And can mergers of companies  with complementarities among both kinds of resources-media and film  production companies, for instance-create especially powerful combina-  tions?
