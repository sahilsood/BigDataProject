A.  \  Based  on  an  organizational  adaptation framework, this  study  examines  the  influence  of  three environmental dimensions-munificence,  stability, and complexity-on  top management  team  turnover.  In  addition  to  investigating  the  direct  influence  of  these  environmental  dimensions,  indirect  effects  through  firm  performance  and  strategic  change  are  also  examined; the indirect effect of environmental complexity through demographic heterogeneity  is  also  studied.  Path  analysis  indicates  that  the  direct  effects  of  the  three  environmental  dimensions predominate. Indirect effects were nonsignificant except for the effect of  instability  and  mun8cence  through  strategic  change.  By  expanding  the  team  turnover  context  to  include  environmental  and  strategic  dimensions,  in  addition  to  previously  examined  performance and heterogeneity factors, this study enhances our understanding of  managerial  turnover as  a form of  organizational adaptation.  A  key  theoretical  perspective  in  the  strategy  and  organizational  theory  areas  is  that  firm  performance  is  highly  related  to  the  dynamic,  evolutionary  nature  of  the  fit  between  environ-  ment and organization (Romanelli and Tushman,  1988). Yet,  the  adaptation  of  the  organization  to  shifting  external  demands  does  not  occur  readily. A major debate in the literature revolves  around  whether  leaders  can  strongly  influence  this  fit  through  strategic  decisions  and  actions  (Child,  1972),  or  whether  resource  constraints  (Hannan  and  Freeman,  1977)  and  institution-  alized  norms  (Zucker,  1983) severely  constrain  decision-makers.  A  growing  body  of  literature  offers  support  for  the  criticality  of  executive  leadership  in  creating  a  fit  of  the  organization  with  its  environment,  summarized  by  Romanelli  and  Tushman as follows (1988: 130): ‘Where environ-  Key  words:  Executive  turnover.  top  management  team  ments are changing and/or performance outcomes  are low or declining, leadership’s primary task is  to intervene on ongoing patterns of  commitment  and  exchange  to  redirect  the  character  of  an  organization’s relationship with its environment .’  To  be  successful  in  their  leadership  roles,  top  executives must  be  vigilant  in  their  monitoring  of environmental conditions to determine whether  the  current  fit  with  the  firm  is  appropriate  or  whether strategic interventions are necessary. As  the process of  interpreting information  from the  environment  the  cognition  of  top  managers  plays  an  important  role in  determining the  quality and timeliness of  such  interpretations,  key  in  forging  a  viable  fit  (Schwenk, 1988).

Bantel  While firm success is linked to a good alignment  between  top  team  members’  cognition  and  the  firm’s environment, a poor match  might arise  if  members  fail  to  update  their  perspectives  in  a  dynamic environmental setting or if  teams fail to  act  upon  a  shift  in  environmental  conditions  because  their  power  base  is  rooted  in  existing  strategic  approaches.  Top  teams  tend  to  act  as  stable governance structures that can restrict the  firm’s ability to change (Tushman and Romanelli,  1985; Brady  and  Helmich,  1984; Meyer,  1972).  When  it  becomes  apparent  that  the  team’s  cognitions anti strategic decision-making behavior  do  not  fit  the  environmental  context,  a  crisis  leading  to  top  executive  replacement  occurs  (Tushman and Romanelli, 1985); a better match  through  executive turnover  is  often  ensured  by  the board  of  directors (Fama and Jensen, 1983).  As  a  result,  the  replacement  of  top  executives  provides an important mechanism for the organi-  zation to overcome inertia (Tushman  and Rom-  anelli, 1985) and to adapt strategically to changing  contexts  (Helmich,  1077; Pfeffer  and  Salancik,  1978; Vancil, 1987).  While  turnover  within  the  management  team  appears  to  he  critical  to  successful  firm  func-  tioning,  most  past  research  has  concentrated  solely on CEO turnover, particularly as it relates  to  the  financial performance  of  the  firm.  Many  studies  have  established  a  link  between  poor  performance  and  an  increased  rate  of  CEO  turnover  (Beatty and Zajac, 1987; Coughlan and  Schmidt,  1985; Lieberson  and  O’Connor,  1979;  McEachern,  1977;  Salancik  and  Pfeffer,  1977;  Warner,  Watts  and  Wruck,  1988). Furtado  and  Karan  (1990), in  their  review  of  the  literature,  conclude,  however,  that  other  factors also play  major  roles.  Other  studies have  identified such  contextual  factors  as  CEO  power  (Allen  and  Panian,  1982), ownership and board of  directors  issues (Goodstein and Boeker,  1991), and socio-  political  constructs (Fredrickson,  Hambrick  and  Baumrin,  1988) as important influences.  Our  focus  on  the  top  team  is  consistent with  the  ‘upper  echelon’  perspective  proposed  by  Hambrick and Mason (1984) and is supported by  recent empirical research on the important influence  of  top teams on strategic and performance issues  (Murray,  1989;  Michel  and  Hambrick,  1992;  Wiersema  and  Bantel,  1992).  The  theoretical  rationale for focusing on the entire team as a unit  is based  on  the  collective responsibility members  share to determine organizational outcomes. Mem-  bers  interact  as  a  decision-making group;  group  dynamics and each member’s cognitive perspective,  personality, and  power  influence the  outcome of  the strategic decision process. Further, studies that  have  compared  explained  variance  using  CEOs  versus the  entire team  have found that  the  team  analysis  is  superior  (Bantel  and  Jackson,  1989;  Finkelstein, 1988; Iiage  and  Dewar,  1973; Tush-  man, Virany and Romanelli, 1985).  instability,  Only  a  few  studies  to  date  have  focused  specifically on turnover within the top team, and  these  were  limited  to  establishing  a  link  with  demographic heterogeneity (Jackson et al., 1991;  Wagner,  Pfeffer  and  O’Reilly,  1984), poor  firm  performance  (Wagner et  al.,  1984), and  merger/  acquisition activity (Walsh and  Ellwood,  1991).  This research is aimed at providing an enhanced  understanding of  the team turnover phenomenon  by utilizing an adaptation framework and focusing  on the firm’s environmental context. A compre-  hensive model of  team turnover as an adaptation  mechanism  is  developed  in  which  the  direct  influences  three  environmental  constructs-munificence,  and  complexity--are  examined.  Further,  the indirect  influence  of  the  environment  through  strategic  change and firm performance is also investigated.  Finally,  the  effect  of  environmental  complexity  through  demographic  heterogeneity  is  also con-  sidered.  Such  a comprehensive  model  not  only  will  provide insight into  the role  of  the environ-  ment  and  strategic  change  in  relation  to  team  turnover, but will also clarify previous findings on  firm performance and demographic heterogeneity.  An  additional  analysis  will  be  conducted  to  examine  whether  the  predictors  of  turnover  in  our  model  have  a  differential  impact  on  team  members based on their hierarchical level within  the top team.  Beyond  our analysis of  the entire  team, our model will also be examined separately  for  the  first  (Chairman,  CEO,  President,  and  COO)  and  second tiers  (senior vice presidents).  its  influence  on  members  of  key  in  DIRECT INFLUENCE OF THE  ENVIRONMENT ON TOP TEAM  TURNOVER  A  firm’s environment  can  be  conceptualized  in  terms of  elements that influence the performance  Top Management  Team Turnover  487  tional  growth  (Aldrich,  1979;  Starbuck,  1976).  Such  capacity  will  buffer  organizations  within  that  environment  from  external  and  internal  hostilities and  enable the  accumulation  of  slack  resources  within  the  organization  (Cyert  and  March,  1963). Top  managers  thus  are  able  to  exercise high discretion in their strategic planning  and  decision  making,  unfettered  by  external  demands  (Hambrick  and Finkelstein,  1987) and  insulated from having to respond to misalignment  of  the  firm  with  its  environment.  It  is  not  a  surprise  that  slack has  been  found  to  assist  the  organization in  maintaining stability in  organiza-  tional coalitions (Bourgeois,  1981).  Lack  of  environmental  munificence,  by  con-  trast, creates difficult and stressful conditions for  managers.  Lack  of  munificence implies little  or  no  organizational  slack,  conditions  of  scarcity,  and  a  threat  to the  firm’s survival.  Scarcity and  threat,  in  turn,  have  been  associated  with  a  variety  of  organizational  responses,  including  formalization,  centralization,  decreased  infor-  mation  processing,  and  restriction  of  communi-  cation and control (Staw, Sandelands and Dutton,  1981;  Zammuto,  1983).  This  results  in  less  decision-making  discretion  for  management,  more  rigid  problem-solving  and  adherence  to  traditional  routines  (Yasai-Ardekani,  1989) and  thus  decision-making that  is  based  on  outdated  information and perspectives. As the inappropri-  ateness of  strategic decisions becomes apparent,  and  top  managers  are  perceived  as  unable  to  the  industrial  level.  The  and thus the survival of  an organization (Dess and  Beard,  1984; Starbuck, 1976). The primary unit of  analysis in defining an organization’s environment  has  been  industry  (industries)  in  which  the  firm  participates  helps  define the firm’s involvement with its environment  as well as the nature of  resources needed for firm  survival. Based on a review of  a variety of  authors  involved in conceptualizing and measuring the task  environment, Sharfman and Dean (1991) conclude  that there are three specific environmental dimen-  sions  identified  as  among  the  most  critical  in  ensuring  the  firm’s  survival:  munificence,  insta-  bility,  and  complexity.  Following  these  authors  and the  work of  Keats and Hitt  (1988) and Dess  and  Beard  (1984),  these  three  dimensions  were  examined in this study for their potential influence  on top team turnover.  As shown in Figure 1, these three environmen-  tal dimensions are expected  to have main effects  on  top  team  turnover.  Indirect  effects  through  strategic  change  and  firm performance  are  also  examined.  Finally,  environmental  complexity  is  expected  to  have  an  indirect  effect  through  demographic  heterogeneity.  The  following  sec-  tions  provide  additional  theoretical  support  for  the  development  of  the  model.  Environmental munificence  Environmental  munificence refers  to  the  ability  or capacity of the environment to permit organiza-  Environmental  Environmental  Figure  1.

Additionally,  managers  may  choose  to  leave  a  situation  in  which  their  autonomy, creativity, ilnd discretion are severely  challenged.  Finally,  lack  of  environmental  munificence  may  also  motivate  cost-cutting  on  the  part  of  the  firm.  Industrial  environments  with  limited  growth  opportunities  often  lead  firms  to  restructure  and  rationalize  their  oper-  ations,  which  may  include  reducing  the  size of  their top management teams.  Hypothesis  1:  Environmental  munificence  will  be  negatively  associated  with  turnover  within  the top management  team.  Environmental instability  Environmental  instability  refers  to  the  rate  of  unpredictable  change  or  turnover  in  those  environmental  factors  pertinent  to  strategic  decision-making  (Duncan,  1972; Sharfman  and  Dean, 1991). Stable environments enable organi-  to  manage  by  established  routines  zations  (Aldrich, 1979; Porter,  1980) as learning require-  ments  are  minimal  (Tushman and  Keck,  1990).  A key role of top managers in stable environments  is  to  manage  symbolically  (Ancona,  1990)  by  legitimating  and  enforcing  the  current  system  and  core  values  (Tushman  and  Keck,  1990),  while  relying  on  routinized  problem  solving  (Eisenhardt, 1989).  is  in  environmental  instability  Environmental  instability,  in  contrast,  places  tremendous cognitive demands on executives and  can also threaten their power bases. A difficulty  inherent  the  constant  need  to adapt  one’s perception  of  the  environment  to  fit  its  current  reality.  While  managers  must  change  their  routine  problem-  solving  habits  by  being  more  structured  and  vigilant in  environmental scanning and  problem  solving (Ancona, 1990: Eisenhardt,  1989), many  managers will  be  very  reluctant  to  expend  such  time and effort (Tushman and Anderson,  1986),  because they are unwilling to abandon their past  frames  of  reference  (Fiske  and  Taylor,  1984).  This might be particularly true for top managers  who  have  gained  their  organizational  power  in  part through their ability to handle environmental  contingencies  (Pfeffer  and  Salancik,  1978);  a  shift in those contingencies threatens to decrease  the  power  of  top  managers (Hambrick,  1981b).  Finally, research on organizational groups points  out a further reason why established teams might  be reluctant to respond to environmental change.  Group  longevity  and  cohesion  influence  infor-  mation-processing  behaviors  by  reducing  the  group’s  willingness  to  search  out  and  actively  internalize  new  or  conflicting  knowledge  (Caldwell  and  O’Reilly,  1982; Janis  and  Mann,  1977; Katz,  1982; Pelz and Andrews,  1966).  It is not surprising, therefore, that environmen-  tal  instability  is  the  factor  mentioned  most  frequently  as  leading  to  externally  induced  changes within  the  organization  (Aldrich,  1979;  Pfeffer  and  Salancik,  1978).  Instability in  such  factors as the socioeconomic and supplier environ-  ments has been linked to CEO turnover (Osborn,  Hunt  and  Jauch,  ‘1980; Pfeffer  and  Leblebici,  1973; Pfeffer and Salancik, 1978), while Tushman  and  Keck  (1990)  found  that  technological jolts  in  the  environment  of  the  cement  industry  led  to executive team  turnover.  Hypothesis 2: Environmental  instability  will be  positively  associated  with  turnover  within  the  top management  team.  Environmental complexity  Environmental complexity pertains to the hetero-  geneity  in  and  range  of  environmental  factors  that  need to be considered in  strategic decision-  making (Child, 1972; Duncan, 1972). As organiza-  tions  in  a  given  industry  expand  their  product  and  market  activity,  the  variety  of  inputs  and  outputs  with  which  they  must  cope  increases  environmental  complexity  (Dess  and  Beard,  1984), as  does the  need  for  increased  strategic  activities (Aldrich,  1979). Such  firms also  need  to  interact  with  multiple  constituencies  whose  demands  often  conflict.  Thus,  a  higher  infor-  mation processing demand results from environ-  mental complexity (Dess and Beard, 1984; Pfeffer  and Salancik, 1978; Terreberry ,1968; Thompson,  1967), the management of which is an inherently  more difficult management  task.  As environmental complexity creates demands  from  a  variety  of  external  interest  groups,  the  organization responds by  becoming more highly  differentiated  (Pfeffer  and  Salancik,  1978;  Thompson,  1967), also reflected in the executive  team.  As  members  of  the  top  team  attempt  to  respond  to  the  diversity  and  complexity  of  the  firm’s environment, they will tend  to focus more  of  their attention on scanning the greater variety  and  number  of  relevant  environmental  sectors  (Daft,  Sormunen, and Parks,  1988). Over time,  individual team  members will  tend  to specialize  in  particular  environmental  sectors  (Hambrick,  1981a) and will become highly differentiated with  regard  to their experiences, attitudes,  priorities,  and  perspectives  (Lawrence  and  Lorsch,  1967;  Pfeffer  and  Salancik,  1978;  Thompson,  1967).  As these varying perspectives are juxtaposed  and  analyzed,  the  result  can  be  conflict (Dougherty,  1987),  difficulty  in  communication  (McCain,  O’Reilly,  and  Pfeffer,  1983),  power  struggles  (Pfeffer,  1983), lack of  consensus (Dess,  1987),  and lack of  attachment to the team (Roberts and  O’Reilly, 1979). Greater cognitive differentiation  has been linked to lower integration and cohesive-  ness within a group and, in turn, to higher levels  turnover  (McCain  et  al.,  1983;  O’Reilly,  of  Caldwell and Barnett,  1989).  Hypothesis  3:  Environmental  complexity  will  be  positively  associated  with  turnover  within  the top management team.  INDIRECT INFLUENCE OF THE  ENVIRONMENT ON  TOP TEAM  TURNOVER  Environment, performance, and top team  turnover  The three  environmental  dimensions might  also  influence top  team  turnover  indirectly  through  the  effect  of  firm  performance.  Each  of  the  environmental constructs is expected to link with  firm performance. First, an environment  lacking  in munificence offers limited growth opportunity  which  leads,  in  turn,  to  intensive  competitive  dynamics  as  firms  seeking  to  expand  must  attack competitors’ market  shares (Porter,  1980).  Intensified  competitive  rivalry  accompanied  by  price  competition results in  lower profitability in  the industry and its firms (Porter,  1980). Second,  environmental  instability  has  a  similar  influence  on firm performance in that it reflects competitive  instability  within  the  industry.  Unstable-thus,  highly cornpetitive-market  conditions indicate that  some firms are gaining market share at the expense  of  others  (Porter,  1980), leading  again  to  lower  industry  and  firm  performance.  Finally,  environ-  Top Management  Team Turnover  489  mental complexity might also lead to reduced firm  performance. Increased variety and diversity of  a  firm’s  business  operations  suggest  that  a  wider  range and greater quantity of  information need to  be processed for effective decision making, creating  strains on the organization to achieve high quality  decision making outcomes. Differentiation in per-  spectives and the lack of shared information among  team members can contribute to lower consensus  within the top team (Dess, 1987) and this, in turn,  has  been  linked  to  lower performance  outcomes  (Bourgeois, 1980; Dess, 1987).  Hypothesis 4a: Environmental munijicence will  be positively associated with Jim performance.  Hypotheis  4b:  Environmental  instability  will  be negatively associated with firm performance.  Hypothesis  4c: Environmental  complexity  will  be negatively associated with firm performance.  A period of  poor  firm performance represents a  potentially  risky  situation  for  the  firm  as  con-  sumers  and  investors  lose  confidence  in  its  viability and strength. As the firm’s top managers  are generally held accountable for firm perform-  ance,  persistently  poor  performance  is  likely  to  be attributed to the decisions and actions (or the  lack  thereof)  of  the  top  management  team.  A  variety of  studies has found that such attributions  are made and that turnover of  top team members  can  result.  Good  performance  has  been  found  to  result  in  high  levels  of  CEO  tenure,  while  poor  performance  is  likely  to  lead  to  CEO  turnover  (or  firing)  (Allen,  Panian  and  Lotz,  1979; Coughlan  and  Schmidt,  1985; Eitzen  and  Yetman,  1972; Gamson and Scotch, 1964; James  and Soref, 1981; McEachern, 1977; Salancik and  Pfeffer,  1977; Warner  et  al.,  1988).  Wagner  et  al.  (1984)  also  found  a  link  between  poor  firm  performance  and turnover within the top team.  Hypothesis  4d:  Firm  performance  will  be  negatively associated  with  turnover  within the  top management team.  Environment, strategic change, and top team  turnover  By  developing  a  coherent  strategy,  top  man-  agers create  a fit between  the environment and  490  M .   F.  Wiersema and  K. A.  Bantel  the firm that is conducive to reasonable success;  as such, the nature of  the environment largely  determines  the  need  for  strategic  change.  To  ameliorate the  effects of  a  poor  environment,  top  management  can  redirect  the  corporate  strategy  of  the  firm  through  divestment  and  diversification decisions which shift the business  portfolio  and, thus, the business environments.  Lack  of  environmental  munificence,  environ-  mental  instability,  and  environmental  com-  plexity  all  represent  difficult  and  threatening  environmental  conditions  that  top  managers  may decide to withdraw from or, at a minimum,  to  reduce  the  firm’s involvement  in.  Hypothesis  5a:  Environmental  munificence  will  be  negatively  associated  with  strategic  change.  Hypothesis  5b: Environmental  instability  will  be positively  associated  with strategic change.  Hypothesis  5c:  Environmental  complexity  will  be  positively  associated  with  strategic  change.  A  shift  in  a  firm’s strategy,  particularly  at  the  corporate  level  where  entirely  new  businesses  might  be  entered  and  old  businesses  dropped,  represents a change in  the requisite  managerial  operating  knowledge,  experience,  cognition,  and  perspectives.  Prahalad  and  Bettis  (1986)  describe how  top managers of  a diversified firm  develop  a  distinct  management  skill,  which  they  label  the  ‘dominant  general  management  logic’.  It is based  on a shared set of  managers’  mental  schemas  (Kiesler  and  Sproull,  1982)  and  is  developed  for  each  set  of  similar  businesses;  it  enables top managers  to concep-  tualize  the  businesses  and  make  resource  allo-  cation decisions. This ‘dominant logic’ tends to  evolve from the requirements of  the largest,  or  ‘core’,  business  from  which  the  firm  originally  grew. When a shift occurs in the key businesses  of  the  firm,  the  established  ‘dominant  logic’  may  limit  the  managers’  ability  to  shift  their  management  approach  (Prahalad  and  Bettis,  1986). Turnover  within  the top team is needed  to accomplish the shift in managerial perspective  necessary to develop a new and more appropri-  ate  ‘dominant  logic’ for  the  changed  portfolio  of  businesses.  Hypothesis  5d:  Strategic  change  will  be  positively  associated  with  turnover  within  the  top management  team.  Past  research  on  the  link  between  strategic  change  and  turnover  has  tended  to  emphasize  strategy at the business, rather than the corporate,  level and to focus on the reverse causality of  the  one  argued  here,  i.e.,  turnover  among the  top  team  occurs  as  members’  inertia  and  lack  of  strategic adaptation  become apparent (Tushman  and  Romanelli,  1985). The  assumption made in  this prior work is that, over time, members tend  to become increasingly specialized and less open  to new environmental  information (Katz,  1982),  which results in more narrow and parochial views  of  the  firm  and  its  main  business.  Turnover  is  then  linked  to  strategic  change  as  the  new  members’  perspectives  and  expertise  represent  a  better  and  more  appropriate  fit  with  the  environment  (Tushman and Romanelli,  1985).  In contrast, we are suggesting that top managers  operating at the level of  corporate strategy must  focus  on  the  ‘big picture’  as  they  manage  the  firm’s portfolio.  As the operating results for any  individual  business  tend  to  be  straightforward,  these  managers  are,  indeed,  able  to  respond  to  environmental  demands  and  pressures  by  reconfiguring the businesses in the firm’s portfolio  to  improve  its  corporate  competitive  position.  The  successful  managing  of  these  new  sets  of  businesses  then  involves the  acquisition  of  the  requisite operating ‘logics’ (Prahalad  and Bettis,  1986)  supplied  by  new  team  members  after  a  turnover.  Environmental complexity, demographic  heterogeneity, and team turnover  A  further  effect  on  team  turnover  is  expected  when environmental complexity is combined with  team  demographic  heterogeneity.  As  described  earlier,  environmental  complexity  to  increased  differentiation  of  perspective  among  the  firm’s  managers;  one  way  in  which  such  differentiation  occurs  is  through  demographic  heterogeneity.  An  individual’s  demographic  characteristics  are  indicators  of  that  person’s  underlying experiences, training, cognitive orien-  tation, attitudes, and perspectives (Dearborn and  Simon,  1959; Vroom  and Pahl,  1971). Thus, an  the  group  toward  demographic  evolution  of  leads  heterogeneity  is  likely  as  it  grapples  with  the  demands of  a complex environment.  Hypothesis  6a: Environmental complexity  will  be positively  associated  with demographic het-  erogeneity.  Demographically  heterogeneous  groups,  while  benefiting  from  the  creativity  resulting  from  cognitive  diversity  (Wanous  and  Youtz,  1986),  will  experience the same difficulties in  communi-  cation and cohesiveness as were described earlier  for  Demographic  heterogeneity in top management teams has been  shown to link with turnover (Jackson et al. 1991;  Wagner et  al., 1984).  differentiated  teams.  Hypothesis 66: Demographic heterogeneity will  be  positively  associated  with  turnover  within  the top management team.  The differential impact of  turnover  predictors  based on top team hierarchical level  While our theoretical  model pertains to the top  management  team  as  a  whole,  it  is  possible  that  the  predictors  might  have  a  differential  effect  on  managers based  on  their  hierarchical  level within  the team. The top tier  (Chairman,  CEO, President,  and/or COO) might  be  some-  what more immune to the pressures for turnover  we  are analyzing; we would thus see a stronger  effect for managers at the second tier (managers  at some level  of  vice-president  rank).  One  potential  reason  for  such  a  pattern  is  the  higher  power  of  the  top  tier;  the  CEO  tends  to be  the  most  powerful  member  of  the  team,  although  there  are  exceptions  to  this  (Mintzberg,  1983).  Generally,  such  issues  as  interpersonal  or  group  dynamics  difficulties  would  be  resolved  in  favor  of  the  top  tier  member.  Vice  presidents  would  also  tend  to  have  higher  accountability  on  such  specific  performance  indicators  as  financial  results,  market share, and growth of  their division(s). If  performance  on these  indicators  is  insufficient,  corporate  level  strategic  change  could  include  divestment  of  that  member’s  division(s)  and  loss  of  his  or  her  job.  Vice  presidents  might  be the scapegoats in such a situation as the top  tier  managers  refuse  to  take  responsibility  for  poor  operating  results (Boeker,  1992).  Top Management Team  Turnover  491  Further,  there  are  institutional  pressures  for  retaining the  top tier  at the helm,  except in  the  case  of  extreme  crisis.  Investors,  consumers,  governmental agencies and other constituents of  the firm rely on the image of  a stable, competent  leadership  at  the  top  (Zucker,  1983);  only  the  very top echelon  members are generally  known  to these  groups.  As  such  the  replacement  of  a  top  tier  member  might  be  construed  by  the  constituent community as an indication of serious  firm  trouble,  a  circumstance the  firm  would  try  to  avoid.  To  investigate the  possibility of  a  differential  impact  of  the  predictors  based  on  hierarchical  level, an additional analysis will  be conducted in  which  the  top  team  will  be  segmented  into  two  tiers.  In summary, turnover within the top manage-  ment  team  is expected  to be influenced directly  by the three environmental dimensions of munifi-  cence, instability, and complexity. Further, their  indirect  influence  through  firm  performance,  strategic change, and demographic heterogeneity  is also examined.  These effects are expected to  have  a  differential  impact  according  to  hier-  archical  level  within  the  team,  with  stronger  effects occurring at the second tier.  METHODS  Sample and data  A  random  sample  of  100  firms  from  the  500  largest manufacturing  firms in  1980, as  listed in  Fortune, was  selected  for  study.  Availability of  the  Economic  Information  System’s I’RINET  line  of  business  data  and  Census  of  Manufacturing  data determined  the  choice  of  time  period  for  this study.  From the initial sample of  100 firms,  15  firms  were  dropped  due  to  lack  of  data  availability,  leaving a  sample  of  85  firms.’  The  sample was distributed by Fortune 100 increments  as  follows:  1-100:  14 firms;  100-200:  14 firms;  Of  the  original  100 firms  in  the  sample,  15  firms  were  eliminated because of  data collection problems. Several firms  lacked TRINET data for the  1980 to  1983 period because they  either represented divisions of larger, multinational companies  or  were  no  longer  individual  corporate  entities,  making  financial and strategic data unavailable. The eliminated firms  were  not  statistically different  from  the  sample of  85  firms  in terms of  either revenue or the rate of  top team turnover.  492  M .  F.  Wiersema and  K. A. Bantel  200-300: 17 firms; 300-400: 23 firms; and 4W500:  17  firms.  Our selection of  data  sources was  predicated  on  the  need  for  detailed  industry  level  data  to  assess  the  firm’s  industrial  environment.  Our  industry level data comes from either the Census  of  Manufacturers or the  U.S. Statistical Abstract,  both  of  which  provide  manufacturing  sector  information  at  the  four-digit  SIC  level.  To  maintain compatibility of  our  data,  we  chose to  utilize  the  TIUNET  data  base  to  assess  line  of  business  activity,  since  its  establishment  level  data is  also collected at the four-digit SIC level.  As Davis and Duhaime (1992: 522) indicate: ‘the  compatibility  of  data  bases  is  important  when  industry trends  are  studied  in  conjunction  with  firm’s data.’  This study utilizes a definition of  the top team  to include the two highest levels of  management  within  a  firm.  what  we call the  top and  second  tier  of  management.  The  composition  of  each  team  was  ascertained  by  the  hierarchical listing  of  a  firm’s executives in  the  Reference  Book  of  Corporate  Managements  (Dun  &  Bradstreet,  1977,  1980,  1983).  The  top  tier  includes  the  following executive positions:  Chairman,  CEO,  President, and COO. The number of  individuals  in  the  top  tier  varies  from  one  (a  combined  Chairman, CEO, President) to three, with a firm  average of  1.7. The second tier includes only the  most senior level of  Vice President listed for the  firm,  thus  it  could  include  the  following titles:  executive  vice-president,  group  vice-president,  senior  vice-president,  or  vice-president,  The  number  of  individuals in  the  second tier  varied  from one (Executive Vice President) to six, with  a firm  average of  2.8.  By  including  only  the  two  upper  levels  of  management  in  our  definition of  the  team,  we  have  maintained  consistency  in  the  degree  of  responsibility  and  scope of  members  of  the top  team. The sample of  85 firms had 380 individuals  within  the  top  management  team.  The  average  size  of  the  top  team  was  4.5  members,  with  a  standard  deviation  of  1.8.  The  average  mean  team  tenure  of  the  top  management  team  was  9.5  years,  supporting  our  assumption  that  this  set of  managers was responsible for dealing with  the  environment  during  the  time  preceding  the  turnover  period  under  investigation  (the  dates  for data collection for each variables are discussed  below).  Measures  Top management  team  turnover  Turnover  within  the  top  management  team  is  defined  as  the  proportion  of  team  members  in  1980 who were  no  longer with  the  firm  in  1983  and were  less than  65  years of  age in  1983. By  eliminating  managers  equal  to  or  greater  than  65  years  of  age  in  1983,  we  control  for  the  effects of  normal retirements, consistent with the  approach  used  by  Puffer  and  Weintrop  (1991).  The  absence  or  presence  of  individuals  in  the  top  management  team  was  ascertained  by  the  executive  listings  in  the  Reference  Book  of  Corporate  Managements  (Dun  and  Bradstreet,  1980, 1983). The three-year  window was chosen  because it represents  a long enough time period  for  sufficient  turnover  to  occur  within  the  executive team,  yet  is  short  enough to see  the  effects of  demographic  heterogeneity  measured  in  1980.  Environment  In  understanding  the  interaction  between  the  organization  and  its  environment,  researchers  have  focused on  defining  organization  environ-  ments in terms of  the resources required  by  the  firm  (Dess  and  Beard,  1984).  Specifically, the  core  of  a  firm’s environment  is  represented  by  its  competitors,  suppliers,  and  customers.  This  arena  represents  the  firm’s  industrial  environ-  ment.  We  limit  consideration  of  the  firm’s  environment to its industry environment, consist-  ent with  Dess and Beard  (1984) and with more  recent  empirical  work  examining  the  environ-  ment-firm interface (Keats and Hitt,  1988).  In contrast to prior studies concentrating on a  single industry, our sample consists of  diversified  manufacturing enterprises operating  in  multiple  industries. Operationalization of  a multibusiness  firm’s environment  necessitates deriving a  com-  posite  measure  that  includes  all  of  the  firm’s  industrial environments. For each firm, a measure  of  the environment was calculated by  multiplying  the firm’s relative sales for each industry by  that  industry’s data;  each  of  these  results  was  then  aggregated,  resulting  in  a  weighted  industry  portfolio  measure  for  each  firm  as  follows:  8  Environment, Pi, where Environmenti represents  the  average  of  the  appropriate  environmental  characteristics for each four-digit SIC(i) in which  a  firm participated  and  Pi is  the  proportion  of  sales  in  the  SIC.  The  time  period  of  1977-80  was selected as it precedes the examined turnover  period  (1980-83).  Environmental munijicence  Based on Starbuck’s (1976) concept, munificence  captures  the  extent  to  which  the  environment  can  provide  sustained  growth.  We  utilize  a  growth-based measure, sales growth, as it reflects  abundance in  terms of  opportunities for market  expansion.  While  this  variable  represents  only  the  measures  identified  by  Dess  and  one  of  Beard  in  their  factor  analysis of  munificence, it  appears  to  strongly  underlie  their  construct.  While  Sharfman  and  Dean  (1991)  argue  that  industry  competition  should  be  included  in  the  munificence  construct,  competition  does  not  address  the  abundance  issue.  Regardless  of  the  number of  players in  an industry, higher growth  markets  generally  represent  more  abundant  environments (Porter, 1980), while slow industry  growth results in  a  market  share game for firms  seeking expansion.  Based on data from the U.S. Statistical Abstract  for  1977  to  1980,  growth  in  total  industry  sales  was  calculated  by  dividing  the  regression  slope  coefficient  by  the  mean  value  for  shipments  (1977-80)  for  the  four-digit  SIC codes  for  the  firm’s three  largest  lines  of  business;  these,  on  average,  represent  76 percent of  the firm’s  total  sales.  Environmental instability  Defined as the rate of  change in factors relevant  to  strategic  decision-making  (Duncan,  1972),  environmental  instability  depends  critically  on  changes in the economic structure of  the industry;  such  competitive  dynamics  represent  a  critical  element of the environment (Sharfman and Dean,  1991). We  thus  measure  instability  by  changes  in the number and size of competitors within the  industry.  This  conceptualization  and  oper-  ationalization of  environmental instability differs  from  previous  work,  in  that  Dess  and  Beard  (1984) focused on instability in sales and employ-  ment  growth,  and  Sharfman  and  Dean  (1991)  measured  technological  instability.  We  chose  to  focus on the competitive dynamics of  the industry  Top Management Team  Turnover  493  because  it  is  a  broader  indicator  of  relevant  aspects  of  instability  in  a  sample  of  firms  in  which  each  firm operates in  multiple  industries.  Further,  a  measure  of  technological  instability  would  not  be  meaningful  in  a  sample  with  multiple  industries  since  the  importance  of  technology varies widely across industries.  One  of  the  primary  elements  of  industry  structure  is  the  number  and  size distribution  of  firms  within  the  industry  (Bain,  1968),  which  economic  theory  suggests  is  linked  directly  to  the vigor of  competition.  Industry concentration  often  has been  viewed  as an  indicator  of  entry  barriers  (Bain,  1%8),  and  empirical  evidence  exists to support the relationship between industry  concentration and firm profitability.  (See Weiss,  1974, for a review.) The industry’s concentration  ratio  (Sherer,  1980),  that  is,  the  percentage  of  total  industry  sales  contributed  by  the  largest  few  firms,  measures  this  element.  The  most  common  variant  is  the  four-firm  sales  concen-  tration  ratio  (the  percentage  of  total  industry  sales  originated  by  the  leading  four  firms).  Gathered  from  the  FTC  Line  of  Business  data  base,  instability  was  measured  using  absolute  changes in  the  four firm concentration  ratio  for  each  business  in  the  firm’s portfolio,  weighted  by that business’ relative sales revenue.  Large absolute changes in the firm’s weighted  concentration ratio  would  indicate  high  degrees  of environmental instability. Changes in  industry  concentration  reflect  shifts in  market  share due  to new entrants, exits, consolidations, and erosion  of  market  share, thus they  capture  the  dynamic  nature  of  the firm’s industrial  environment.  Environmental complexity  For  large  multi-business  firms,  environmental  complexity  can  best  be  conceptualized  by  the  heterogeneity  of  activities pursued  by  the  firm,  given a broad  array of  product-market  environ-  ments.  We chose product complexity, or hetero-  geneity,  as  the  best  reflection  of  the  greater  information-processing requirements which large-  ly define environmental complexity (Child,  1972;  Dess and Beard,  1984). Dess and  Beard  (1984)  point  out that firms in  industries which produce  many different outputs or products, will find the  disposal of  their output to be more complex due  to  having  to interact  with  a  larger  number  and  variety  of  firms.  Dess  and  Beard  (1984)  added  494  M .  F.  Wiersema and  K. A .  Bantel  geographic concentration and input/output diver-  sity  to  their  operationalization  and  found  only  geographic concentration  to be  significant. Geo-  graphic concentration  was not measured here  as  it is unlikely t o  be a significant factor in a sample  of  large,  multinational  firms.  Sharfman  and  Dean  (1991)  added  technical  intricacy  to  their  conceptualization, but  it, too,  is not meaningful  in  this multi-industry sample.  Environmental complexity was measured using  product  specialization ratios.  The primary prod-  ucts  of  a  plant  are  those  which  determine  its  industry  classification;  all  other  products  are  referred  to as secondary products. The value of  a plant’s primary products, in comparison to the  value of  its total production, is referred to as its  degree of  specialization; thus, high specialization  suggests that  products  are  produced  exclusively  for  the  industry  and  represents  homogeneity  of  operating  requirements.  The specialization ratio  for  each  line  of  business  (subtracted  from  one  so  that  increasing  environmental  complexity  is  indicated  by  larger  values  of  the  variable)  was  multiplied by its relative firm sales and aggregated  for each firm.  This results in a weighted average  specialization  ratio  that  reflects  the  average  complexity  (specialization)  faced  by  the  firm  across its businesses. Industry specialization ratios  at  the  four-digit  SIC  code  level  were  gathered  from the  U.S. Census of  Manufacturers.  industry  Validation of  the  environmental measures  Following the  approach  of  Sharfman  and  Dean  (1991),  we  examined  the  predictive  validity  of  our environmental measures. We would expect all  three environmental measures to be significantly  correlated  with  level  performance.  Environments with high munificence in terms of  sales  growth  should  provide  opportunity  for  enhanced  industry  performance  (Porter,  1980);  munificence  had  a  highly  significant  positive  correlation of  0.309 with industry average profit-  ability.  Environmental  instability should  have  a  negative  correlation  as  changes  in  industry  structure  rivalry  and  decreased  industry  attractiveness  and  perform-  ance (Porter,  1980); the: correlation was  -0.180,  significant at the 0.05 level. A negative correlation  is also expected for environmental complexity as  greater information processing demands increase  decision making difficulty and decrease efficiency  indicate  competitive  and  effectiveness;  a  significant  correlation  of  -0.185  was found.  Organizational performance  Performance  was  measured  using  a  three-year  average  of  the  firm’s  Return  on  Assets  (ROA)  relative  to  the  industry  for  the  time  period  1977-80.  ROA  is  one  of  the  most  commonly  used accounting based performance  measures in  the  strategy  literature.  This  measure  controlled  for  industry  by  dividing  the  firm’s  three-year  average ROA by the three-year average industry  ROA. The  1977-80  time period  was selected as  it  immediately  precedes  the  turnover  period  being  studied.  All  data  on  firm  and  industry  performance  were  gathered  from  the  COMPU-  STAT data base.  Strategic change  Corporate  strategy  within  large,  multibusiness  organizations reflects diversification decisions on  the  mix  and  emphasis  of  businesses within  the  corporate portfolio (Ansoff, 1965; Rumelt, 1974).  Strategic  change  was  operationalized  by  using  change in the firm’s diversification strategy from  1977 to  1980.  Based  on  line  of  business  data  from  TRINET,  the  diversification strategy  of  the  organization  was  measured  using  the  entropy  measure (Jacquemin and Berry, 1979), as follows.  For a firm operating in N industry segments. Let  Pi be  the  percentage  of  total  firm  sales  in  the  ith segment. Then  Entropy of total diversification =  N  Piln(l/Pi)  i= 1  Demographic heterogeneity  Studies  investigating  the  effects  of  top  team  demographic  heterogeneity  often  have  focused  on the cohort-related traits of  age, organizational  tenure, and team tenure for their theoretical  and  empirical  importance.  As  these  measures  tend  to be highly correlated, team tenure heterogeneity  was  selected  as  the  most  relevant  to  team  turnover. Fredrickson et al. (1988) point out that  as a member’s tenure on the top team increases,  a  closer  alignment  of  managerial  values  occurs  between that individual and board members; the  result  is  an  increase  in  power  and  influence for  the team member. Heterogeneity on this variable  suggests variations  in  power  across  team  mem-  bers,  which could have a potentially detrimental  and  destabilizing  effect  on  group  dynamics,  leading to  turnover.  Furthermore,  greater  team  tenure  heterogeneity  has been  shown to lead  to  lower  levels  of  cohesiveness  and  integration  within groups,  resulting in  a higher  incidence of  turnover (O’Reilly et  al.,  1989).  In addition, heterogeneity on education curricu-  lum will  be examined. In contrast  with the team  tenure  variable,  education  curriculum  measures  a person’s cognition  more  directly:  a  manager’s  personality,  cognitive  style,  and  training  are  reflected  in  curriculum  choice  (Holland,  1973).  Diversity in cognition in a decision-making group  has been found to link with creative and change-  oriented decision outcomes (Wanous and Youtz,  1986; Wiersema  and  Bantel,  1992), yet  diverse  viewpoints  can  create  strains  in  the  decision-  making process  (Pfeffer,  1983). The selection of  these  two  demographic heterogeneity  variables,  reflecting  both  cohort  and  cognitive  issues,  allows  a  broad  assessment  of  the  demographic  heterogeneity  construct.  The demographic heterogeneity variables were  measured  for the  1980 period. The demographic  heterogeneity  on  team  tenure  was  measured  using  the  coefficient of  variation,  calculated  by  dividing  the  standard  deviation  by  the  mean.  Allison’s  (1979)  review  of  inequality  measures  suggests  a  preference  for  the  coefficient  of  variation because of  its scale invariant properties,  as compared to the standard deviation or variance.  For  the  categorical  variable,  education  curricu-  lum,  Blau’s  (1977)  index  of  heterogeneity  was  applied . 2   Education  curriculum  was  measured  using  the  specialization  of  the  highest  obtained  university  degree  (arts,  sciences,  engineering,  business, and  law).  Control variables  Three  trait  demographic  variables-mean  age,  mean  organizational  tenure,  and  mean  team  tenure-were  also  considered  as  potential  con-  trols. While there is theoretical rationale for the  Top Management  Team Turnover  495  inclusion  of  all  three,  they  tend  to  be  highly  correlated.  Mean  team  tenure  was  selected  for  inclusion, consistent with our earlier decision on  demographic heterogeneity.  RESULTS  Table 1 presents the means, standard deviations,  and correlations among the variables. Substantial  correlations exist between top management team  turnover  and  mean  team  tenure,  firm  perform-  ance,  strategic  change,  environmental  munifi-  cence,  environmental  instability,  and  environ-  mental complexity. The correlations are positive,  as  expected,  with  the  exception  of  mean  team  tenure,  firm  performance,  and  environmental  munificence.  The data were analyzed using two steps. First,  we used regression analyses to test for the effects  of  each  of  the  independent  variables  on  team  turnover.  Second, path  analysis was used to test  the model illustrated in Figure 1. A path-analytic  framework  is  the  appropriate  analytical method  when  both  direct  and  indirect  influences  are  hypothesized  (James,  Muliak  and  Brett,  1982)  as shown in the model in  Figure  1.  The  results  of  the  hierarchical  regression  analysis for  top  team  turnover  are  reported  in  Table 2a. Following the causal model  set  out in  Figure  1, we entered the control variable,  mean  team tenure, first, followed by firm performance,  strategic  change,  and  the  demographic  hetero-  geneity  variables  (team  tenure  and  education  curriculum).  Then  each  of  the  environmental  variables,  munificence,  instability,  and  com-  plexity, were  entered.3  For  a  more  comprehensive  examination  of  the  exact  relationships  identified  in  Figure  1,  additional  empirical  investigation  using  path  analysis  was  conducted.  Through  a  series  of  multiple  regressions  of  each  variable  in  Figure  1, path  analysis allows us  to examine  the  effect  of  all preceding variables on team turnover. Path  coefficients  were  derived  by  regressing  each  variable  on  all  prior  variables  in  the  model.  In  accordance  with  a  theory-trimming  approach  to  path  analysis,  we  excluded  all  coefficients  not  * Blau’s  index of  heterogeneity  is  calculated  as follows:  Let  P, equal  the  proportion  of the  group’s individuals in  the ith  category  (the  five  educational  curriculum  categories).  Then  Blau  index of  heterogeneity  =  1 - C(P,)’.  Additional measures of firm performance were also analyzed  including  a ten-year time frame (197&198O),  which was both  controlled  and  not  controlled for by  average industry ROA.    o o O 1 .   0 2 0 0 .   * * 9 2 2 . 0 -   * * 0 4 2 0 .   * 0 0 2 0 .   2 5 0 0 .

The  final  estimates  are  reported  in  Figure  2,  and  the  decomposition  of  the  causal  relationships  is  shown  in  Table  3.  The  final  model  explained  38  percent  of  the  variance  in  top team turnover.  As  shown  in  Figure  2  and  Table  3,  all  three  environmental  variables  have  a  strong  direct  effect on  top  team  turnover,  providing support  for Hypotheses 1, 2,  and 3. In addition, strategic  change  had  a  significant  effect  on  top  team  turnover,  providing support  for  Hypothesis  5d.  Support was also found for some of  the hypothe-  sized  linkages  between  the  environmental  and  mediating  variables.  Environmental  complexity  was  negatively  related  to  firm  performance  (Hypothesis  4c).  Environmental  instability  had  the expected significant positive relationship with  strategic change (Hypothesis 5b). Environmental  munificence  also  has  a  significant  positive  relationship  with  strategic  change,  contrary  to  our  expectation.  The  overall  results,  however,  offer  little  support  for  the  indirect  linkages  illustrated in Figure 1. Indirect effects of environ-  mental  factors  through  firm  performance  were  not  supported,  primarily  because  performance  was  not  significantly  associated  with  turnover.  Only  indirect  effects  of  environmental  munifi-  cence  and  instability  through  strategic  change  were  found.

Final  path  mediation  model  Top Management Team  Turnover  499  the  key  determinants of  turnover within the  top  management  team  are  environmental-lack  of  munificence, instability, and complexity. Each of  these  environmental  conditions  represents  a  difficult  and  stressful  context  for  executive  decision-making,  one  that  is  unlikely  to  be  sustainable  for  a  long  period  of  time.  Top  managers  leave  their  firms  as  they  experience  stress,  threats to their power,  outdated perspec-  tives, conflicts, cost-cutting, and/or the desire for  higher autonomy and challenge.  Additional analysis by hierarchical level within  the  team  indicates  that  our  model  predicts  turnover  better  for  the  second  tier  than  for  the  top tier. By the time managers attained positions  in the top tier (Chairman, CEO, President, and/  or  COO),  they  are  likely  to  have  established  more  entrenched  power  positions  and  to  have  greater  symbolic  importance  as  figureheads,  attributes  which  make  them  less  vulnerable  to  losing their jobs as a  result  of  factors examined  here.  Holding the second tier managers  directly  accountable  for  poor  operating  results,  even  if  some  scapegoating  occurs  as  a  result  (Boeker,  1992), also occurs.  While  this  analysis is  useful  in  helping  to  pinpoint  the  adaptation  dynamics  for  two  subsegments of  the top team,  it  is  also  important  to  note  that  the  best  explanation  of  top team  turnover is based on an analysis of  the  team  as  a  whole.  This  is  consistent  with  other  studies that  demonstrate  that  an  analysis of  the  entire  team  is  superior  to  one  based  solely  on  the CEO in terms of  explained variance  (Bantel  and Jackson,  1989; Finkelstein,  1988; Hage  and  Dewar,  1973; Tushman ef al.,  1985).  environmental  instability  on  top  team  turnover  was direct  and that 20 percent  was mediated  by  strategic  change.  Finally,  environmental  com-  plexity  had  no  indirect  effect  through  group  demographic  heterogeneity.  Neither  heteroge-  neity  variable  was  significantly related  to either  team  turnover  or  complexity.  Based  on  our  analyses,  the  direct  effects  of  environmental  factors  on  top  team  turnover  predominate  the  model, while the indirect effects represent a very  small  proportion  of  the  environmental  factors on t ~ r n o v e r . ~   the  total  effect  of  In  light  of  the  asymmetric  distribution  of  the  dependent variable, top team turnover, additional  analyses were conducted to examine the robust-  ness of  the model. The results of  these analyses  basically confirm  that  strategic change,  environ-  mental instability and complexity have significant  effects on the incidence of  team  turnover.  Additional analyses were conducted to examine  top and second tier turnover  as shown in Table  2b.  While  the overall  regression  results  proved  to  be  significant,  the  model  explained  far  less  variance when we examined turnover within the  top and second tiers of  management separately.  For the second tier, mean team tenure, strategic  change,  and  environmental  complexity  contrib-  uted  significantly  to  the  explained  variance  in  team  turnover  (adjusted  RZ of  29%). For  the  top tier, only strategic change and environmental  instability  contributed  the  explained  variance  in  team  turnover  (adjusted  R2 of  14%).’  significantly  to  DISCUSSION  This  research  was  based  on  an  organizational  adaptation  framework  in  which  top  executives  are  responsible  for  forging  a  link  between  the  firm and its environment; such a role necessitates  a good  alignment between  the  executives them-  selves and  the  firm’s environmental  conditions.  Consistent  with  this  framework,  we  found  that  A more complex investigation of team turnover  within  an  adaptation  viewpoint  requires  a  con-  sideration  of  the  role  of  firm  performance  and  strategic  change.  First,  indirect  relationships  between  the  environment and turnover  through  performance  were  investigated.  Some  support  for  the  link  between  the  environment  and  firm  performance  was  found:  environmental  complexity was related to poor firm performance  in  this  sample.  However,  the  lack  of  a  Iink  between firm Derformance and turnover resulted  in  no  confirmation  of  the  linkage  Additional analysis examined turnover for the top manage-  ment  team  not  controlling  for  age.  The  result  of  the  full  model depicted in  Table 2 was  an  adjusted R2 of  0.09, with  between  the  environment  and turnover  through  significant  coefficients  for  mean  team  tenure  and  strategic  performance.

Bantel  inclusion of  environmental complexity; perform-  ance was significant in our regression model until  complexity  Mas  added.  This  points  out  the  importance of  examining team turnover within an  environmental  context.  Other  major  differences  between  our  study  arid  that  of  Wagner  et  al.  (1984)  are  our  measure  of  firm  performance  (three-year average ROA controlling for industry  ROA  versus  a ten-year  average  of  firm  ROA),  our  use  of  an  elite  definition  of  the  top  team  (mean  of  4.5,  range  from  2  to  8)  versus  an  inclusive  definition  (range  from  5  to  41),  and  our control for retirements.  Our model also investigated the role of  strategic  change,  based  on  the  theory  that  threatening  environmental  conditions  can  be  managed  through  changes in corporate  strategy that shifts  the  environments  with  which  the  firm  interacts  and  necessitates some  turnover  in  top  manage-  ment.  While  strategic  change  had  a  significant  relationship  with  team  turnover,  only  environ-  mental instability had a significant indirect linkage  with team turnover through strategic change, as  predicted.  It appears that managers cope with an  unstable environment  through strategic changes,  that  may,  in  turn,  necessitate  some  turnover  within the top team to improve the alignment of  managers’ cognitions with the new environment.  These findings extend  our  understanding  of  the  link between strategic change and team turnover  beyond  the  more  conventional  assumption  of  turnover  bringing  fresh  perspectives  to  the  strategic  management  task,  leading  to  strategic  change  (e.g.,  Tushman  and  Romanelli,  1985).  This study denionstrates that the opposite causal  relationship  can  occur,  particularly  at  the  level  of  the  corporate strategy.  Team  demographic  heterogeneity  was  also  investigated as mediating the relationship between  environmental complexity and turnover and was  not supported; heterogeneity was not linked with  either complexity or turnover.  It appears that  at  the level of  the top management team, the issue  of  demographic  diversity is  not  a  critical factor  in an individual’s decision to remain on the team.  This may be due largely to the nature of selection  processes  to  management  positions  at  the  very  top  echelons  of  elite  1J.S. corporations.  Strong  norms  exist  within  such  firms  regarding  who  is  promoted  to  the  top  levels,  with  sponsorship  ensuring  their  inculcation  of  firm  values  and  perspectives  and  their  ultimate  success.  The  addition of  such managers to the executive team  either  contributes  to  demographic  homogeneity  or adds heterogeneity  that is not  dysfunctional.  The  lack  of  findings  here  of  a  dysfunctional  effect  of  team  heterogeneity  is  consistent  with  Bantel  and Jackson  (1989), who found  that  age  and  tenure  heterogeneity  neither  assisted  nor  hindered  the  ability  of  bank  top  management  teams  to  reach  consensus  on  and  implement  innovations for their firms. Jackson et al. (1991)  also  had  generally  consistent  results  in  their  analyses of  elite subgroups (most comparable to  our  definition of  the  top  team)  of  bank  holding  companies.  With the exception of  heterogeneity  on  college  alma  rnater,  none  of  their  other  heterogeneity  variables  (age,  tenure,  education  level,  education  curriculum,  experience  outside  industry,  and  military  experience)  predicted  turnover.  An important methodological change was made  in  this  study  compared  to  past  research.  This  study  controlled  for the  effect of  age,  and  thus  of  retirements,  on turnover;  none  of  the  other  studies  on  team  turnover  (Jackson  et  al.,  1991;  Wagner  et  al.,  1984; Walsh and Ellwood,  1991)  did this. A lack of control for age makes it difficult  to disentangle those influences on turnover that  are  independent  of  an  individual’s  retirement  decision.  When  age  was  not  controlled  for  in  our  regression  model,  only  mean  team  tenure  accounted for  a significant increase in  explained  variance,  while  the  adjusted  R2  for  the  entire  model  dropped  from  0.38  to  0.09 (see footnote  4) *  A  limitation  of  the  current  study  pertains  to  the  time  periods  over which  our  analyses were  conducted.  Our  model  examined  environmental  and  firm  (performance,  strategic  change,  and  demographic  heterogeneity)  predictors  of  turn-  over that were all measured  over the same time  period.  Perhaps new insights would be gained if  a study were designed in which the relationships  among predictors could be examined more closely  by  postulating  a  causal  sequence  among  them.  For example, environmental  predictors could be  measured as causally prior to performance, which  in  turn  could  precede  the  measure  of  strategic  change.  This  approach  would  allow  a  disen-  tangling of the causal sequencing of  these factors,  enhancing our understanding  of  the dynamics of  the process we have  examined  in  this study.  Of  course,  researchers  would  need  to grapple  with  the difficulties inherent in  longitudinal research,  such as controlling for prior turnover.  of  group  dynamics  would  also  appear  to  be  warranted.  Top Management  Team Turnover  501  Future research directions  While  this  study  demonstrated  a  relationship  between environmental influences and top execu-  tive  turnover,  it  does  not  shed  much  light  on  how  the  environment  triggers  turnover  nor  on  whose  responsibility  it  becomes  to  initiate  executive  replacement.  Are  executives  leaving  voluntarily to extricate themselves from situations  that are stressful andor lacking in creativity and  autonomy,  or  are  the  decisions  about  their  leaving  being  made  for  them?  Do  managers  proactively leave when it becomes apparent that  industry performance is suffering yet before the  effects are felt by  their firm, or are there better  indicators of  performance that would show that  poor  firm  performance  actually  does  precede  turnover? What  is  the  role  of  the board in  the  process of  initiating and selecting the removal of  members from the top management team?  Investigation could also focus on the  issue of  congruence of  environmental perceptions across  team  members.  As  individual  managers  seek  to  specialize  in  their  respective  environmental  subsegments, a  lack  of  congruence or  differen-  tiation  across members might evolve; the impli-  cations of  such lack of  consensus with regard to  both  dysfunctional group process  and  turnover  could be examined.  Finally,  a  potentially  important  variable  in  understanding  team  turnover  is  the  interaction  patterns among members, specifidy, interaction  frequency and intensity. For the highly differen-  tiated teams that evolve in  response to environ-  mental complexity, interactions among members  can  be  difficult and  stressful.  If  team  members  meet frequently, the effects of  high differentiation  might be mitigated as more thorough information  processing and better conflict resolution occurs.  On  the  other  hand,  high  interaction  might  highlight the incompatibilities among team mem-  bers,  exacerbating  the  dysfunctional  effects.  Interaction patterns could be ascertained through  observation or questionnaire.  This study should provide further  encourage-  ment  to  researchers  to  focus  on  the  effects  of  environmental  factors  on  various  facets  of  organizational adaptation.
