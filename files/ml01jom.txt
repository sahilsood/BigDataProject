Prior research has determined that such a workforce can be developed via an organiza- tion’s commitment to its employees (OCE) in the form of ample training and compensation, fairness, and meaningful personal consideration. We argue that OCE will enhance ﬁnancial performance where it is able to improve the quality of a decision making process that emphasizes ample information processing, collaboration, and initiative. Conversely, these three dimensions of decision making are expected to be of little value where OCE—and hence a capable and motivated workforce—are lacking. These expectations were borne out in our study of Korean companies. Speciﬁcally, we found positive associations between return on assets and the interactions between OCE and information processing, collaboration, and initiative, respectively. We found also that these interactions contributed the most to return on assets in uncertain environments, where effective information processing, collaboration and initiative were especially important. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Lee / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 163–189 importance of decision making dimensions such as careful analysis, environmental scanning, collaboration, and even initiative, the jury is not yet in on how useful these qualities are to a ﬁrm’s bottom line (Mintzberg, 1994; Noda & Bower, 1996). While convincing conceptual arguments have been advanced to support the utility of decision and environmental analysis, cooperation among decision makers, and a bias towards action, the supporting empirical evidence has been weak and conﬂicting (compare, for example, Fredrickson & Mitchell, 1984; Eisenhardt, 1989; Miller & Cardinal, 1994). The thesis of this article is that the most frequently discussed process dimensions of decision making, by themselves, are unlikely to contribute to superior performance. Rather, it is only when an organization is able to build a cadre of capable, dedicated decision makers that it will be able to execute process effectively and earn superior ﬁnancial returns (Barney, 1986; Barney & Zajac, 1994; Lado & Wilson, 1994). For example, analysis or scanning of the competitive environment is apt to be more effective when performed by a corps of able, committed individuals using their imaginations and initiative than when executed in rote fashion. Similarly, consultation among decision makers will be more productive when it is done in a spirit of cooperation and dedication than when it serves as an occasion for politicking or bickering. In addition, proactive decision making is best when employees have the interests of the organization at heart, not when it serves to further empire building or advance individual careers. We are not arguing that these process dimensions of decision making are not important—they are. But they alone are unlikely to have much impact on the bottom line without a capable, dedicated, and motivated workforce to ensure their quality. The question then becomes: How can an organization develop such a force of inspired decision makers? Recent research in organizational behavior and human resource management has shown that an organization’s commitment to its employees (OCE) tends in turn to create a more committed and responsible workforce (Eisenberger et al., 1986; 1987; 1990; Organ, 1990; Moorman, Blakely & Niehoff, 1998; Mowday, Porter & Steers, 1984; Shore & Wayne, 1993; Steers & Porter, 1987: 575–583). OCE is evidenced by factors such as a company’s care for its employees’ well being and satisfaction, by the fairness and compassion shown in its rewards and punishments, and by the level of its investment in human resource development and compensation (Eisenberger et al., 1986; 1987; 1990; Organ, 1990). Outcomes of actual or even perceived OCE have been demonstrated to include: more dedicated and motivated employees (Organ, 1988; Shore & Wayne, 1993), greater initiative and creativity at work (Eisenberger et al., 1990), and a stronger sense of cooperation and community (Setton et al., 1996; Wayne et al., 1997). An emerging body of research at a more macro, organizational level of analysis has conﬁrmed many of these ﬁndings. Studies have begun to show that some types of OCE, namely progressive human resources management practices in training, compensation, and reward-sharing, have improved manufacturing quality, reduced turnover, and enhanced ﬁnancial performance (Arthur, 1994; Delaney & Huselid, 1996; Huselid, 1995; Snell & Youndt, 1995). Lee and Miller (1999) have shown that OCE can even help ensure that market cost leadership and differentiation strategies will be better executed. In short, effects of organizational practices on individual perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors, can collec- tively produce critical effects at the organizational level.

Lee / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 163–189 165 But to date, too few studies have delved into the potential reasons for a relationship between high commitment work practices and organizational performance and effectiveness. The causal and moderating mechanisms are buried inside a “black box.” We believe that one critical reason why OCE and progressive HRM practices may have a profound impact on performance is because they lead to better decision making. This study will argue that three of the most often discussed dimensions of decision making process: information processing, collaboration, and initiative, will enhance ﬁnancial performance where OCE is strong—that is, where a high level of commitment to employees contributes to the capability, dedication, and motivation of the entire workforce. That workforce includes everyone involved in making decisions, from the upper and middle managers charged with deciding issues, to the staff experts gathering and analyzing information and presenting options, to the equally important line personnel who must recognize problems and opportunities and suggest ways of addressing them. We will argue further that the stronger decision making process that results from OCE will be especially valuable for ﬁnancial performance in uncertain envi- ronments, where intelligent and energized decision making is very much required to keep an organization in tune with its competitive setting (Brown & Eisenhardt, 1998). Our research is on Korean companies. In Korea, the relationship of ﬁrms or superiors to their employees is typically one of paternalism. There, businesses or bosses are expected to assume responsibility for the overall well-being and development of their subordinates (Steers, Shin & Ungson, 1989: 98 –103). Also, a Confucian work ethic prevails which truly prizes the importance of superior and subordinate contributing together to the work group and the corporation (Choi, 1985; Ko, 1992; Han, 1991; Ungson, Steers & Park, 1997). Anecdotal accounts suggest that these Confucian ethics coupled with managerial paternalism blend to create a climate in which those ﬁrms most committed to their employees receive unusual dedication from them in return (Lee & Lee, 1994; Lee & Miller, 1999). Korean organizations, therefore, were deemed to be especially promising sites for establishing the relationships between OCE, decision making, and ﬁnancial performance—they are espe- cially apt to show an effect from OCE. 1.1. The nature and effects of OCE We have already indicated that OCE is a multifaceted concept. And indeed, an organi- zation can exhibit commitment to its employees in many ways. A ﬁrm may be solicitous of workers’ physical and emotional well-being, devote itself to a high level of job satisfaction and employee development, provide fair and ample compensation, and share its proﬁts (Eisenberger et al., 1986; 1990; Huselid, 1995; Mowday et al., 1984; Organ, 1990; Orpen, 1995; Williams & Anderson, 1991). Companies committed to their employees typically invest more than similar ﬁrms in progressive HRM practices such as training and education, and in the total package of compensation (Arthur, 1994; Huselid, 1995). They also distribute rewards more equitably and charitably. Companies may, for example, share proﬁts in times of abundance or, when conditions tighten, cut top managers’ compensation to avoid layoffs. Also they may try to ensure good working conditions and, wherever possible, create rewarding, well-designed jobs (Eisenberger et al., 1986).

Lee / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 163–189 These forms of OCE were found to have important effects on behavior at work. Eisen- berger et al. (1990), Moorman et al. (1998) and Shore and Wayne (1993) discovered that perceived OCE made employees more conscientious in carrying out their job responsibilities. It also engendered a sense of involvement with the company, and greater employee initiative and innovation. Organ and Konovsky (1989) and O’Reilly and Chatman (1986) noticed that an organization’s commitment to its employees even stimulated more company “citizenship” behavior from people. Speciﬁcally, it caused employees at all levels to become more dedicated to the organization and more prepared to exceed their job requirements. At the organizational level of analysis, studies of progressive HRM practices in training, compen- sation and reward sharing have shown that these can lead to reduced turnover and absen- teeism, better quality work, and better ﬁnancial performance (Arthur, 1994; Delaney & Huselid, 1996; Huselid, 1995; Snell & Youndt, 1995). Anecdotal evidence has shown these reactions to be especially strong within Korean companies (Lee & Lee, 1994). This may be because of the sense of community and devotion that OCE engenders within Confucian cultures (Park, 1984; Ko, 1992; Han, 1991). Accord- ing to sociologists, community can be construed as an emotional environment that induces members to cooperate in the pursuit of common goals (Brownwell, 1950; Nisbet, 1962). Members are sustained emotionally by the community— here by an organization. They experience a sense of belonging and of devotion to the group. Such attachment is a strong motivator in performing group-related tasks, fostering cooperation and collaboration, and unleashing initiative (Choi, 1994). 1.2. Commitment, decision making, and performance Organizational processes are only as good as the people who carry them out. The best conceived programs are unlikely to succeed if the people designing and executing them are incapable or unmotivated (Lado & Wilson, 1994). In the same way, decision making processes, no matter how intendedly rational, putatively collaborative, or proactive by design, will falter unless they are performed with intelligence, cooperation, and dedication to ﬁrm objectives. In short, the positive outcomes reported for OCE may be highly pertinent for enhancing the quality of decision making. Drucker (1993), Pfeffer (1993), and Whitney (1994), for example, have shown how the emotional and social climate inside a ﬁrm can enhance productivity, spur creativity, and speed implementation. Ghoshal and Bartlett (1995) believe that the most responsive and competitive organizations—those that develop the deepest and most relevant competen- cies—are the ones that are best able to pull their managers and workers together, commit them to the organization, and help them transcend narrow personal interests. The resulting workforce is better at identifying important challenges and opportunities, and far more willing to collaborate across functional areas. Unfortunately, there has so far been little research on the impact of OCE on proﬁtability. Most studies have been conducted on many employees within a single organization, and focus on outcomes such as turnover, satisfaction, and attitudes towards work. Although some organization level studies of HRM practices have shown some bottom line effects, only the more concrete, policy driven aspects of OCE are captured by HRM. In addition, the decision Downloaded from  jom.sagepub.com  at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 13, 2016 D. Miller, J. Lee / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 163–189 167 making process has been ignored as a potential mediating construct between OCE and ﬁnancial performance. We believe that although OCE may enhance proﬁtability, it will have its greatest effect where the employee capabilities and motivations it unleashes are harnessed by an effective decision making process. Unless decision makers at all levels of a company are guided to make decisions in a manner that stresses awareness, reﬂection, collaboration and initiative, their ﬁrm will not be able to recognize and adapt to the most important challenges and opportunities. In other words, unless a capable and dedicated workforce is embedded in an effective process of decision making that exploits its talents, the beneﬁts of OCE many not exceed its costs. 2. Hypotheses In integrative reviews of the literature on decision making process, three dimensions come up again and again as being potentially vital to the quality of decision making (c.f. the syntheses of Fredrickson, 1986, Miller, 1987, Mintzberg, 1973, and Hart, 1992). Although they have been named differently we call these dimensions information processing, collab- oration, and initiative. The information processing dimension reﬂects the effort devoted to scanning and analyzing information to better understand a company’s threats, opportunities and options. The collaboration dimension gauges how much people consult and collaborate together in making decisions. And the initiative dimension assesses whether decision makers are biased towards action or proactiveness in competing and getting things done. While each of these dimensions has the potential to contribute to more effective decisions, we suspect that this potential will not be realized unless decision makers are capable, motivated, and committed to their companies. In other words, even the most promising approaches to making decisions will produce little beneﬁt without the support of a cadre of competent, motivated human resources (Barney, 1986; Barney & Zajac, 1994; Lado & Wilson, 1994). Previous research has shown that OCE will help to create these resources (Eisenberger et al., 1986; 1990; Moorman et al., 1998; O’Reilly & Chatman, 1986; Organ & Konovsky, 1989; Shore & Wayne, 1993). 2.1. Information processing A recurrent theme in the literature on decision making concerns what may broadly be termed information processing. Different aspects of the information processing dimension have variously been referred to as analysis and scanning (Aguilar, 1967), intended rationality (Miller, 1987), comprehensiveness (Fredrickson, 1986), and synoptic decision making (Hart, 1992). The essential contrast here is between unreﬂective and intuitive decision making and a process that takes into account, more thoroughly and systematically, a wider range of information. One might, for example, contrast Cyert and March’s (1963) and Lindblom’s (1968) locally focused and cognitively truncated modes of decision making with Ansoff (1965) and Andrews’ (1971) more systematic and painstaking approaches. Our own infor- mation processing construct is not, however, concerned with achieving some rational ideal, with all the delays that entails. Rather it assesses the range of information considered in Downloaded from  jom.sagepub.com  at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 13, 2016 168 D. Miller, J. Lee / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 163–189 making decisions, the depth of such consideration, and the assurance that external as well as internal matters are taken into account. Previous studies reveal conﬂicting evidence of the efﬁcacy of comprehensive approaches to information processing. The earliest literature argued that formal analysis and planning were useful for helping managers understand their environments and better utilize their resources (Steiner, 1969). But most empirical studies of systematic planning have not detected links with performance (Mintzberg, 1994). Indeed, Mintzberg (1994) has argued that rigid planning processes are counterproductive. Although there is little reason to believe that planning rituals per se will have any effect on the quality of decisions, some scholars have rightly maintained that information process- ing, more broadly deﬁned, can support more effective decision making. For example, creative option generation, incisive analysis, and dedicated environmental scanning might all improve the quality and relevance of decisions (Wilensky, 1971; Wildavsky, 1979). Unfor- tunately, here again empirical research results were mixed and conﬂicting. Some analyses indicated that such aspects of information processing are useful even in turbulent environ- ments (Eisenhardt, 1989), other studies that they are useful only in stable environments (Fredrickson & Mitchell, 1984), and other research still that they are of questionable utility altogether (Mintzberg, 1994). We believe that information processing in the form of assiduous scanning of the envi- ronment and intelligent and systematic analysis of problems and opportunities can be useful for many companies. Scanning can uncover important customer needs, market threats and opportunities, as well as areas of strategy requiring improvement (Aguilar, 1967). By the same token, devoted and expert analysis of conditions inside and outside a company decreases chances of making errors and improves the quality of the options considered and the choices made (Andrews, 1971; Hart, 1992; Wilensky, 1971). So why does the literature fail to show clearly the beneﬁts of such information processing? We think the reason is that the amount of scanning or analysis and even the techniques used fail to get at what is most important about information processing—namely its qual- ity—that is, the intelligence and commitment that is brought to bear on information pro- cessing activities. Scanning can be broad, but misdirected; intensive but irrelevant. Analysis too can be systematic, but off the mark and uninspired. Only a capable and dedicated cadre of decision makers—from managers to staff experts to line operatives— can make scanning and analysis really work. Employees who are well trained and dedicated to the interests of their organizations are more likely to engage in scanning that is important, follow leads that matter, poll customers with real interest, and monitor competitors with concern. Such employees will also work harder to generate creative decision options, dedicate themselves to discovering opportunities and challenges, and act in an informed and timely fashion. In referring to the quality of information processing, we do not mean its informality or ﬂexibility. Formal processes can be hidebound, or they can serve as useful guides for informed and motivated decision makers. Similarly, ﬂexible processes can be chaotic when performed by poorly trained managers, or they can be liberating when engaged by managers working in the best interests of their organizations. We noted above that prior research has demonstrated that OCE has an important impact on employee behavior and attitudes. It contributes to the capability, dedication, motivation Downloaded from  jom.sagepub.com  at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 13, 2016 D. Miller, J. Lee / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 163–189 169 Fig. 1. Relating OCE and Decision Making to Company Performance. Items in boldface are those measured in this study; others are mediating constructs that we could not assess in this research. We showed that the relationships of OCE with employee capability, dedication, commitment and cooperation have already been well established by numerous researchers. The effects of those decision maker characteristics on the quality of information processing, collaboration and initiative—and hence on proﬁtability, have been argued in the paper, and are reﬂected, indirectly, in the analyses of Tables 3 and 4. and initiative of the workforce. If so, it is reasonable to believe that OCE will enhance the quality of information processing, and through it, the level of ﬁnancial returns (please see our model on Fig. 1). Thus our ﬁrst hypothesis: H1: Financial returns will be positively inﬂuenced by the interaction between OCE and information processing. Speciﬁcally, scanning and analysis are apt to improve ﬁnan- cial performance only if there is a high level of OCE. Qualiﬁcation: We do not expect the quantity information processing, by itself, to have much impact on performance. It is only the happy combination of quantity and quality that can truly enhance performance. Unfortunately, most survey research on decision making is unable to assess the quality of processes such as information processing. We believe that the null and conﬂicting results of past process studies reﬂect this inability. And since our study too cannot directly assess the quality of decision making, our measures of process alone are unlikely to bear any direct relationship to proﬁtability. 2.2. Collaboration Another central dimension of decision making is collaboration—the degree to which people consult and interact with one another in making decisions. Collaboration is a function of the number of individuals and departments involved in making decisions, as well as the scope and intensity of their deliberations (Floyd & Wooldridge, 1996; Fredrickson, 1986; Miller, 1987). A high level of collaboration exists, for example, when different parties or groups communicate frequently in identifying and resolving a broad range of issues. Some studies have argued that collaboration allows managers to reconcile or creatively integrate diverse perspectives. As a result, it renders decisions more informed and more pertinent (Amason, 1995; Mason & Mitroff, 1981). Such collaboration has been deemed especially useful among middle managers (Floyd & Wooldridge, 1996; Miller, 1987; Wool- dridge & Floyd, 1990). By contrast, other scholars have suggested that collaborative activity Downloaded from  jom.sagepub.com  at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 13, 2016 170 D. Miller, J. Lee / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 163–189 can slow things down, especially when there is broad involvement from functional units that embrace conﬂicting ideologies or perspectives (Fiol, 1994; Labovitz & Rosansky, 1998; Wildavsky, 1979). Interaction may also bring warring parties together, allowing political agendas and gamesmanship to take precedence over organizational needs (Pettigrew, 1973; Whitney, 1994). In some cases, so much emphasis may be put on consultation and meetings, that responsibility is diffused and no one feels accountable for any decision (Wilensky, 1971). This Janus-faced aspect of collaboration suggests that its implications for performance are unclear. Again, it seems, it is not only the quantity of collaboration that is important, but also the quality. And the latter relies on the capabilities, and dedication of decision makers: Will they be subject to political scufﬂing, or will they subordinate their parochial interests for the good of the ﬁrm? Will they interact to improve the quality of their decisions and sharpen their sensitivity, or will they meet endlessly and mire themselves in peripheral matters? We believe that OCE, by building a workforce that has the interests of the company at heart, will minimize parochial politics and facilitate effective collaboration. It will make employees more willing to sacriﬁce their short term interests to the overall needs of the company (Moorman et al., 1998; Setton et al., 1996). It will also foster trust, making decision makers at all levels more willing to share information with superiors, peers and subordinates (Senge, 1990; Wayne et al., 1997). In this climate, discussions may focus on more mean- ingful information and more accurate interpretations (Senge, 1990). Clearly then, OCE can improve the quality of collaboration and so lead to more informed and timely decisions and to better ﬁnancial performance. H2: Financial returns will be positively inﬂuenced by the interaction between OCE and collaboration. Speciﬁcally, collaboration among decision makers is more apt to im- prove ﬁnancial performance if there is a high level of OCE. 2.3. Initiative Our initiative dimension assesses the degree to which decision makers take a proactive stance in addressing problems and opportunities (Collins & Moore, 1970; Miller, 1987; Mintzberg, 1973). Initiative may be contrasted with inertia or purely reactive behavior. For example, do managers look for opportunities, try to beat competitors to the punch, or take substantial risks in pursuing growth or innovation? Or do they delay taking action, lag their rivals, and eschew risk taking to the point of stagnation? Some scholars have argued that initiative is healthy for a company. It can keep a ﬁrm energized, innovative, and entrepreneurial. It combats stagnation, makes a company adap- tive, and keeps it in tune with its environment (Eisenhart, 1989; Miller, 1987). It also allows some organizations to beat their rivals in seizing market opportunities and establishing ﬁrst mover advantages (Collins & Moore, 1970; Teece et al., 1997). And it can generate rapid growth (Miller, 1990). But there is a darker side to initiative. It may allow too much risk taking. Bold actions are notoriously costly when they miss their mark. And if initiatives at lower levels of an organization are uncoordinated, they can result in conﬂicting product offerings and market positions (Pettigrew, 1973). Bold initiative may also take the form of Downloaded from  jom.sagepub.com  at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 13, 2016 D. Miller, J. Lee / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 163–189 171 empire building that serves the interests of a single manager at the expense of the whole company (Miller, 1990; Pettigrew, 1973). It seems then that as with information processing and collaboration, it is not only the quantity but the quality of initiative that matters most to the bottom line. And once again the soundness of the entire cadre of decision makers may be crucial in this regard. Dedicated, responsible employees are far more apt to use their initiative intelligently and responsi- bly— by pursuing the most sensible opportunities, eschewing unnecessary risks, and avoid- ing actions that conﬂict with the best interests of the company. OCE, once again, may help create such a workforce. It has been shown to engender a greater sense of community and responsibility (Eisenberger et al., 1987, 1990); one that makes employees take to heart the mission, principles, and well-being of the larger group (Moorman et al., 1993; 1995). OCE should therefore enhance the quality—the promise, judiciousness, and organization-wide beneﬁts— of initiative. H3: Financial returns will be positively inﬂuenced by the interaction between OCE and initiative. Speciﬁcally, initiative among decision makers is more apt to improve ﬁnan- cial performance if there is a high level of OCE. 2.4. Environment Some scholars have argued that the decision making process is especially important to an organization’s success in more challenging environments. Intensive and effective informa- tion processing, collaboration, and initiative among decision makers are needed to help companies to adapt to uncertain, dynamic environments (Brown & Eisenhardt, 1998; Eisen- hardt, 1989; Eisenhardt & Bourgeois, 1988). In these contexts it is particularly vital to track competitor initiatives, technological changes, and altering demand patterns, as these chal- lenges evolve rapidly and are of real consequence to a ﬁrm’s performance. The need to adapt to these challenges requires that more information be gathered from the environment and subjected to incisive analysis (Aguilar, 1967; Wilensky, 1971). The complexity of an uncertain environment also demands more effective collaboration—more discussion and interaction among decision makers with different kinds of knowledge (Katzenbach & Smith, 1993). In addition, the higher levels of change in uncertain settings make inertia especially dangerous. They demand that managers act quickly, assume the initiative, and take calcu- lated risks to stave off obsolescence and seize opportunities (Brown & Eisenhardt, 1998; Eisenhardt, 1989). In summary, under demanding conditions of uncertainty, the quality of information processing, collaboration, and initiative are particularly important as they help to facilitate complex adaptation. As we have argued, OCE can contribute to such quality. By contrast, in stable environments where products, customer tastes, and technologies change very slowly and predictably, fewer complex decisions are needed to adapt the ﬁrm to its environment. Effective information processing, collaboration and initiative thus be- come less important to proﬁtability. H4: The interactions between OCE and all three of our process dimensions will contribute more to performance in uncertain than in stable environments.

The sample We stated earlier that we chose to study Korean companies in part because of their communal, paternalistic cultures and the potential importance of commitment to employees within these organizations (Ko, 1992; Han, 1991; Lee & Lee, 1994). The industries selected for study were textiles, machinery, automotive parts, and electronics. These domains were chosen because of the large number of Korean companies operating in each, because they represented both thriving and faltering sectors of the economy, and because their ﬁrms demonstrate large variations in process and performance. To ensure comparability among our ﬁrms we studied only manufacturers. We avoided foreign companies and government- run organizations, and selected only single-business enterprises or single-business proﬁt centers of multibusiness companies—all from different parents. Our target population within the four industries consisted of 350 randomly chosen ﬁrms that met the above criteria and were listed in the 1994 Report of the Korean Productivity Center. We ﬁrst approached ﬁrms by writing a letter to the chief executives, asking if they and their ﬁrm would participate in our study of strategic management practices. Of those approached, 158 agreed to cooperate in the study. Only these ﬁrms were sent questionnaires, and 129 of them responded with the requisite two questionnaires each (see below). The top managers of all ﬁrms that agreed to participate were contacted by telephone after they had received the questionnaires. This was done to further gain their commitment to the study, to ensure that the right executives would be responding to the questions, and to go over the instrument to explain any items that might be unclear. This task was performed by four research assistants ﬁnishing their Masters’ theses in strategic management. The assistants were all trained by the principal investigator to deﬁne and explain all of the scale items. In all cases, the respondents themselves rated each question and then returned the question- naires to us. The topmost executives (directors general or general managers) completed the scales on decision making, environmental uncertainty and one of our OCE measures, while the most senior vice presidents provided information on our other OCE measure and ﬁnancial performance. These individuals were chosen because they were the most knowledgeable about the dimensions we were examining. Our use of different respondents within each ﬁrm also guarded against common method variance in the testing of our hypotheses. In order to minimize chances of raters distorting their answers, we assured all respondents that their responses would be kept completely conﬁdential. We promised that we would never reveal to anyone the names of the managers or the names of their organizations. Our ﬁnal sample consisted of 38 textile ﬁrms, 31 machinery ﬁrms, 30 automotive parts producers, and 30 electronics ﬁrms. Of the respondents, 108 companies were independent ﬁrms, while 21 ﬁrms were subsidiaries of larger enterprises. To guard against nonresponse bias we compared the revenues and return on assets ﬁgures of our sample with those of the four industries for the same year (1994). Industry averages were obtained from the Korean Productivity Center (Hangook Giup Chongram, 1990 –1995). For the textile and electronics industries there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between our respondents and the Downloaded from  jom.sagepub.com  at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 13, 2016 D. Miller, J. Lee / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 163–189 173 industry averages for revenues and ROA. But for the machinery and auto parts industry, our sample ﬁrms did show somewhat higher ROAs. Thus our ﬁndings may not apply with equal precision to poorly performing machinery and auto parts companies. 3.2. The instruments and variables All questionnaire items were translated from English into Korean by one of the authors, a Korean native educated in the US who has taught in several top American business schools. Each translated item was discussed with four Korean graduate students of organizational behavior and strategy who were ﬂuent in the English language. Organizational commitment to employees (OCE) was measured in two ways, with each measure being completed by a different respondent in the organization. The two measures and two respondents were used to enhance the validity of the results. The ﬁrst measure, OCE1, was assessed using four anchored ﬁve-point Likert-Scale items suggested by Eisen- berger et al. (1986) (see Appendix 1): These assessed how much the organization cares about employee well-being, about ample and fair pay, about satisfaction at work, and about sharing proﬁts. Choi (1990) and Lee and Lee (1994, 1995) argue how important these factors are to Korean workers’ dedication to an organization and its objectives. The Cronbach alpha for the OCE1 measure was 0.82. The most senior vice president of each organization completed this scale. The second measure of OCE, OCE2, employed two 5-point Likert scales asking the CEO of the ﬁrm to rate his organization relative to its principal competitors on 1.) how much the company invested in education and competence development for its employees, and 2.) how much the company invested in total compensation, including beneﬁts, for its employees. The Cronbach alpha for this OCE2 measure was 0.71. The topmost executive of each organiza- tion completed these scales. Although OCE1 and OCE2 correlated signiﬁcantly (r 5 0.26, p , 0.003), the two scales clearly measured different aspects of the commitment to employees construct, and afforded some opportunity for testing the robustness of our ﬁndings. This was conﬁrmed by the exploratory factor analysis of Table 2A. The three dimensions of decision making were assessed using the anchored Likert scales of Miller (1987) translated into Korean. Information processing was measured using Miller’s (1987) scales for scanning and analysis (8 items); these items gauge how much information is gathered about the market environment and how much thought and analysis go into making decisions. Collaboration was measured using Miller’s scales for interaction (5 items); these items measure how much people and groups interact, communicate and consult in making decisions. Finally, Initiative was measured using Miller’s scales for proactiveness and risk taking (4 items); these assess how willing mangers are to take some competitive initiative and the accompanying risks in order to grow, innovate or beat rivals to the punch. Appendix 1 presents the items used in our survey. The Cronbach alphas for the three decision making dimensions of information processing, collaboration, and initiative, were 0.81, 0.79 and 0.77, respectively. An exploratory factor analysis (orthogonal, varimax) was run to determine whether the items loaded on the three process dimensions as expected. The results are given on Table 2B, and show the sharp pattern of loadings for the items used. The items all loaded highly only on their own process Downloaded from  jom.sagepub.com  at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 13, 2016 174 D. Miller, J. Lee / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 163–189 dimension and not on either of the others. Thus we averaged the items to produce a composite score for each of the three dimensions. Financial Performance was measured using return on assets. This measure has been the most widely used to date in business research (Hambrick, 1983; Rumelt, 1984) and applies with equal relevance to each of the industries we studied. We asked the top executives to supply from their ﬁnancial statements ﬁgures on sales, total assets, and before-tax earnings. For the 30 public companies, we obtained published ﬁnancial reports to conﬁrm the ﬁgures provided by the top managers. ROA as computed from published ﬁgures correlated at 0.98 with ROA computed from data supplied by the managers. Because the level of uncertainty, that is, change and unpredictability, in a ﬁrm’s market can itself inﬂuence ﬁnancial performance, we controlled for this in all of our analyses. Uncertainty was measured using the 5 anchored 5-point Likert scales of Khandwalla (1977) and Miller (1987) (see Appendix). The scales assessed the rate of product obsolescence, the frequency of changes in industry marketing practices and technologies, and the predictability of competitors’ activities and customers’ demands. The Cronbach alpha for uncertainty was 0.63, a modest value no doubt due to the very diverse indicators composing the variable. We also employed industry dummies as control variables in all of our hypothesis tests. 3.3. Inter-rater reliability We wished to ensure that respondents from within the same company agreed in their responses to the questionnaire. So we had two respondents in 25 companies reply to the same questions. Responses were given independently and without consultation among the partic- ipants. The Pearson correlations among the two respondents averaged as follows for our variables: OCE1, 0.67, OCE2, 0.68, information processing, 0.70, collaboration, 0.64, and initiative, 0.60. All of these relationships were signiﬁcant at beyond the 0.005 level, and were acceptable according to the criteria established by Khandwalla (1977: 658) and Van de Ven & Ferry (1981). 3.4. Analyses The means and standard deviations for the total sample are given on Table 1A, as are the breakdowns by industry. The correlation matrix is given in Table 1B. Hypotheses 1 to 3 were tested using the moderated OLS regression analyses of Tables 3 and 4. In these analyses, return on assets is regressed against OCE, uncertainty, industry dummies, and the three process dimensions, respectively. In order to establish the robustness of our ﬁndings, separate analyses were conducted for OCE1 and OCE2. The hypotheses were tested using interaction variables between either OCE1 (Table 3) or OCE2 (Table 4) and each of the process dimensions. The statistical signiﬁcance of the additional variance explained over and above the otherwise full model was then computed. In order to reduce potential problems of multicollinearity, the components of the interaction term were standardized before multipli- cation (Smith and Sasaki, 1979). Hypothesis 4 maintained that the interaction between our process variables and OCE would contribute more to performance in uncertain than in stable, predictable environments.

Speciﬁcally, to the full models of Tables 3 and 4 (i.e., with an OCE-uncertainty interaction term added), we added another interaction term which is a product of the process dimension, OCE, and uncertainty. We examined the sign of the three-way term and computed whether the amount of additional variance it explained over and above that of the otherwise full models, was statistically signiﬁcant. These results are presented in Tables 5 and 6. 4. Findings Table 3 indicates that the interaction term for OCE1 and information processing is indeed positive and signiﬁcant at the 0.01 level. Thus Hypothesis 1 is supported. This is conﬁrmed by the analyses of Table 4, in which the same interaction term, this time for information processing and OCE2, is again positive and signiﬁcant at beyond the 0.01 level. Thus, even when using different measures and different respondents, OCE appears to enhance the value of information processing. Table 1B Pearson correlation matrix 1. Uncertainty 2. Info.

N for all models 5 129 Collaboration seems to beneﬁt most from OCE in the form of investments in training and development, and investments in compensation (OCE2). These are very concrete organiza- tional responses that create and attract a more talented workforce; one that may be especially suited to complex collaborative efforts. By contrast, employees who are merely “satisﬁed and motivated” (the province of OCE1) may not be talented enough to overcome the organiza- tional boundaries that lie in the path of effective collaboration. It may also be that OCE1, which taps “concern” for employee well-being and satisfaction, may have less impact on the quality of collaboration because some executives reporting a high level of “concern” do not always follow it up with concrete actions. Tables 3 and 4 support Hypothesis 3: the interaction terms between the initiative dimen- sion and both OCE1 and OCE2 are positive and signiﬁcant at beyond the 0.05 and 0.01 levels, respectively. Clearly, OCE enhances the value of initiative. To further establish the robustness of these ﬁndings, we decomposed the information processing and initiative dimensions into their subcomponents of analysis and scanning, and proactiveness and risk taking, respectively (see Appendix 1 for the breakdowns). These were the same subcompo- nents identiﬁed by Miller (1987) in developing his process scales, which were used in this study. We then repeated the analyses of Tables 3 and 4.

In other words, all eight of the eight predicted interaction terms were positive and signiﬁcant at beyond the 0.05 level (these ﬁndings are available from the ﬁrst author). Hypothesis 4 suggested that the positive interaction between process and OCE would be more useful in uncertain than in stable environments. This hypothesis was tested by the three-way interaction terms added to the full models of Tables 3 and 4, and shown in Tables 5 and 6. All six analyses showed positive interactions, and ﬁve of the six terms were statistically signiﬁcant (three at beyond the 0.05 level; two at beyond the 0.10 level). As discussed above, it appears that OCE2—the investment in training and education and in total compensation—may do slightly more to enhance the quality of collaboration in uncertain environments than more abstract and symbolic considerations such as fairness, and concern for employee satisfaction and wellbeing (OCE1). 5.

Five of the 6 three-way interaction terms—which were added to the full models already containing the two-way interactions—were signiﬁcant as well (3 at beyond the 0.05 level). All in all, there is little doubt that, at least in Korean enterprises, a company’s commitment to its employees can pay off ﬁnancially. However, this is true mainly if the ﬁrm employs an effective decision making process: OCE1 did not show any signiﬁcant direct relationship to return on assets, and OCE2 did exhibit such a relationship, but with modest levels of statistical signiﬁcance. Thus by itself OCE does not appear to have a very strong direct relationship with performance. We do not deny that OCE, and some of the progressive HRM practices contained therein, may indeed have some impact on different aspects of performance. This, in fact, is the claim of scholars such as Arthur (1994), Delaney and Huselid (1996), Huselid (1995) and Snell and Youndt (1995). But in our study the direct impact was modest. A key contribution of this research has been to look inside the “black box”—to make a far stronger connection between OCE and performance via the mediating construct of decision making. We suspect that it was largely through its impact on the quality of decision making that OCE drove performance. There appears then to be a powerful connection between the devotion to the human capital of an organization and the competence and motivation that enrich decision making processes such as information processing, collaboration and initiative. In this study, the dimensions of decision making process did not demonstrate any direct relationship with performance. As expected, and as suggested by the myriad conﬂicting ﬁndings in the literature, not one of our process dimensions showed any signiﬁcant effect on ROA in any of the models. This is very much in line with our contention that it is not the quantity or extent of information processing, collaboration, or initiative that matters most. Rather it is the ability and motivation of decision makers to engage in useful information processing, collaboration and initiatives, that enhances the quality of decisions and helps performance. This usefulness will be a product of the training and ability of employees, their motivation to be resourceful, and their willingness to work together and use their talents for the good of the organization. As previous research has shown, OCE helps to elicit all of these behaviors. This ﬁnding is interesting in the light of the debates about whether information processing, collaboration and initiative are useful qualities of a decision making process (Miller & Cardinal, 1994; Mintzberg, 1994; Noda & Bower, 1996). The ambiguous ﬁndings in the decision making literature to date suggest that these characteristics may not be very important. Some authors have advocated that it is the ﬂexibility of the decision making process that is critical (Mintzberg, 1994; Brown & Eisenhardt, 1998). Certainly ﬂexibility can have real advantages in bringing about speedy and creative decisions, but it can also lead to impulsive acts and chaotic behavior. And while structured and formal approaches to decision making may foster rigidity, they can also target people towards key priorities, ensure that they “cover the bases,” and encourage thorough but efﬁcient decision making that is a source of real competitive advantage. In other words, we believe that it is not so much the formality or ﬂexibility of decision making as the talents, training and motivations of those making the decisions that are most critical for performance. But this clearly is an issue for further research. We believe too that OCE-induced improvements in information processing, collaboration and initiative not only have a direct effect on the quality of decisions and performance, they Downloaded from  jom.sagepub.com  at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 13, 2016 182 D. Miller, J. Lee / Journal of Management 27 (2001) 163–189 also lead in the long run to far more potent and sensitive organizational learning processes. Effective learning relies on appropriate scanning and analysis of information, collaboration to exchange and validate information and construct different conceptual models, and exper- imental initiatives to learn about the environment and test new courses of action (Fiol, 1994; Nonaka, 1996; Senge, 1990). We have found that every one of these activities beneﬁts from the investment in human capital represented by OCE. And that, perhaps, is why OCE seems to be making an especially important contribution to the efﬁcacy of the decision making process in uncertain environments (Fiol, 1994). It is there that organizational learning is of paramount concern, and also rather urgent (Brown & Eisenhardt, 1998). We would like to see more research into such connections. Speciﬁcally, given the divergent ﬁndings for OCE1 and OCE2, it would be useful to know just which aspects of OCE—training, compensation, human consideration, reward sharing— have the greatest impact on decision making and organizational learning. Also it is important to determine which characteristics of decision makers and decision making are most affected by these inﬂuences—and how. For example, what are the impacts of the different components of OCE on social skills, motivation, self-conﬁdence, team learning, creative options generation, and so forth? And at what levels of the organization—and in which competitive contexts—are these inﬂuences most crucial to performance? It is such ﬁner grained research that may tell us why OCE1 was an inferior facilitator of collaboration than OCE2. More broadly, we would like to see more work that bridges the schism between macro and micro approaches to decision making (e.g., Ostroff, 1993; Ryan, Smith & Johnson, 1996). Many micro studies have failed to interest managers because their results have not been shown to have an impact on organizational performance. At the same time macro level analyses, by failing to focus on the human element, have been plagued by misspeciﬁed models and noncumulative results. By combining macro and micro perspectives we hope researchers will be able to derive results that not only help corporate performance, but also make for a more humane, digniﬁed, and gratifying work environment. Further research also needs to be undertaken to determine whether our own ﬁndings will generalize to other nations and cultures. It is important to bear in mind that this is a study of Korean companies. In Korea, the Confucian ethic makes it especially important for ﬁrms to display care for their employees; indeed such care is widely held to be an important responsibility of employers. It may also be true that Korean workers respond especially well to commitment from their companies—that the Confucian ethic demands reciprocation from employees in the form of greater effort and dedication to the group. These conditions render Korean ﬁrms ideal venues for supporting our hypotheses. It will therefore be important to test the notions of this paper on American and European organizations to establish the generality of our ﬁndings.
