STEPHEN CERRONE  JPMorgan Chase  Most turnover research positions employee turnover as the dependent variable and  focuses on identifying its antecedents. In this study, we viewed turnover as a key  predictor in determining unit-level performance. Specifically, a structural model was  developed and tested that links managerial and employee turnover with performance  through efficiency. We tested the model using a sample of 262 BURGER KING?  restaurants. Results demonstrate that efficiency, measured as customer "wait time,"  mediates the relationships of both management and crew turnover to both sales and  profit, and efficiency, measured as food waste, does not mediate the relationship of  turnover to sales or profit.  Over the past 50 years, organizational researchers  have devoted a great deal of attention to the study  of employee turnover (Allen, Shore, & Griffeth,  2003; March & Simon, 1958; Mobley, 1977). Much  of this research has focused on turnover as an out  come of a sequential process that begins with job  This article was improved by the insightful comments  supplied by John Delery, Mark Gavin, Dave Ketchen,  James Price, and Jason Shaw.

Although a number of researchers have sug  gested that some turnover is healthy for an organi  zation (Price, 1977; Shaw, Gupta, & Delery, 2005),  the predominant view underlying turnover re  search is that the phenomenon is disruptive and  expensive (Mueller & Price, 1989; Staw, 1980) and  that understanding the causes of turnover is essen  tial in order to reduce it.  Various attempts to measure the costs associated  with turnover have demonstrated the importance of  turnover research. Researchers have often esti  mated the costs to organizations of recruiting, se  lecting, and training new hires (Sagie, Birati, &  Tziner, 2002). One industry plagued by exorbitant  turnover is the food service industry, where turn  over rates often exceed 100 percent annually (Zu  ber, 2001). Costs associated with turnover in the  U.S. fast-food industry have been estimated at $500  to $3,600 per crew member1 (White, 1995), with  total industry costs of retraining exceeding $4.3  1 "Crew member" refers to any nonmanagerial em  ployee working in a fast-food restaurant.  133 This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:57:34 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  134 Academy of Management Journal February  billion per year. Reasons cited for leaving jobs in  this industry include poor management, low com  pensation, and wanting to improve one's quality of  life (White, 1995).  Recently, reduced turnover has been examined  as one outcome of "high-involvement human re  source systems," which can ultimately be linked  with organizationally valued outcomes, including  performance measures such as sales and profit  (Batt, 2002; Huselid, 1995). However, this line of  research fails to explain the mechanism by which  reduced turnover leads to improved sales and  profit. Although early researchers suggested turn  over leads to inefficiencies, thereby reducing organ  izational performance (Price, 1977; Staw, 1980),  little if any research has empirically linked turn  over, efficiency, and performance (e.g., Shaw et al.,  2005).  Therefore, the present study was designed to be  gin fleshing out the mediating links between turn  over and unit-level performance. In doing so, we  fill a gap in the literature by theoretically and em  pirically identifying efficiency as a mediator in the  relationship between employee turnover and unit  level performance. For the purpose of the present  study, we defined turnover as the number of em  ployees who leave an organization annually. Effi  ciency refers to the ratio of output to input (Fabri  cant, 1969). More specifically, in the food service  industry, measures of efficiency include customer  wait time (i.e., how long customers wait for service)  and food waste. Finally, unit-level performance is  equated with effectiveness, or the degree to which  stated goals are achieved (i.e., sales and profit).  A PROPOSED MODEL OF THE RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN TURNOVER AND UNIT-LEVEL  PERFORMANCE  Three fundamental research questions motivated  our study: (1) Does turnover affect unit-level per  formance? (2) If turnover does affect unit-level per  formance, are there any mediating mechanisms? (3)  What is the value of a stable workforce? Utilizing a  knowledge-based view of organizations as an un  derlying framework, we developed and tested a  structural model of the relationship between man  agement and employee turnover and performance  through efficiency. Figure 1 depicts our proposed  model.  As our model shows, we view the relationship  between turnover and performance as fully medi  ated by efficiency. Further, in line with previous  research (Glebbeek & Bax, 2004), and as our time  lags show, we believe that the turnover-efficiency  link is more immediate than the efficiency-perfor  mance link. In essence, we suggest that turnover  results in immediate efficiency disruptions as there  will be too few experienced staff members to serve  customers. However, it is only after efficiency is  poor for a sustained period of time that perfor  mance is affected. That is, we view performance as  Conceptual Model of the Impact of Turnover on Unit-Level Performance  FIGURE 1  HI  Management  Turnover,  Time 1  H4  Customer  Wait Time,  Timel  H6  Sales,  Time 2  Crew  Turnover,  Timel  H3  Food Waste,  Timel  H8  Profit,  Time 2 This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:57:34 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2006 Kacmar, Andrews, Van Rooy, Steilberg, and Cerrone 135  a marathon rather than a sprint. For example, inef  ficient stores may have a good month or two owing  to a special promotion that lets them close perfor  mance gaps. However, over time inefficient stores  will post more poor than good months, creating  significant performance differences between them  selves and efficient stores. Thus, we argue that the  immediate impact of turnover is felt through re  duced efficiency and that this impact is eventually  evident in performance.  We examined the relationships posited in Figure  1 using a sample of 262 BKC-owned BURGER KING  restaurant locations. In addition to the knowledge  based view of organizations, we drew upon related  literature in the areas of social exchange (Eisen  berger, Huntington, Hutchinson, & Sowa, 1986) and  strategic choice (Child, 1972). The rationale for  each of the links in Figure 1 is explained below.  MANAGEMENT AND CREW TURNOVER  Theories of social exchange are often used to  explain why employees express loyalty to their or  ganizations or supervisors (Settoon, Bennett, & Li  den, 1996; Shore & Barksdale, 1998). Social ex  change theory is based on the norm of reciprocity  that essentially suggests employees will feel obli  gated to reciprocate rewards received from a donor  (Gouldner, 1960). In order to pay back their debt,  they must remain with their organizations. Simi  larly, leader-member exchange (LMX) theory  (Dansereau, Graen, & Haga, 1975) acknowledges the  relationship between employees and their manag  ers as an exchange relationship in which employ  ees reciprocate fair treatment from their managers  by working hard to fulfill their managers' requests  (Settoon et al., 1996). Further, employees recipro  cate with feelings of commitment toward their  managers and organization (Liden, Wayne, & Spar  rowe, 2000; Shore & Wayne, 1993), and these feel  ings produce a need or desire to remain with the  organization (Gerstner & Day, 1997). However, if a  manager with whom an employee has bonded  leaves the organization, these feelings of commit  ment may be reduced. In this case, the psycholog  ical contract the employee has formed with the  manager is broken (Rousseau, 1995), and the norm  of reciprocity no longer exists. When the manager  leaves the organization, the employee experiences  a reduced sense of indebtedness and no longer feels  compelled to remain with the organization. Thus,  following social exchange theory, we predict:  Hypothesis 1. Management turnover is posi  tively related to crew turnover.  TURNOVER AND EFFICIENCY  The relationship between turnover and effi  ciency can be explained in terms of Grant's (1996)  knowledge-based theory of organizations. A key  tenet of this theory is that firms that successfully  create, maintain, and apply job-relevant knowledge  will perform better in the marketplace than firms  that do not. Two key aspects of this theory are  knowledge transfer and coordination. Kim stated,  "The mental models in individuals' heads are  where a vast majority of an organization's knowl  edge (both know-how and know-why) lies" (1993:  44). Thus, knowledge transfer pertains to the  knowledge that exists within individuals and how  it is transferred between individuals. Explicit  knowledge is that which is written, easily commu  nicated, and often contained in policies, proce  dures, or rules within organizations (Grant, 1996).  Explicit knowledge is common in the food service  industry, in which employees follow detailed in  structions for food preparation and customer ser  vice. Tacit knowledge is not easily articulated and  is acquired through practice.  An example of tacit knowledge gained in the  fast-food environment is the ability to anticipate  when another batch of fries will be needed on the  basis of the length of the customer line. Training  manuals explain how to make fries, not when. After  gaining experience behind the counter, crew mem  bers can anticipate the need to drop a basket of fries  in the fryer by recognizing that nearly every cus  tomer orders fries and that one basket of fries serves  three to five customers. Thus, when a queue forms,  tacit rather than explicit knowledge tells the crew  member when it is time to cook fries. Tacit knowl  edge also occurs in the grill area. For example, food  preparation taught in training differs from how it is  actually performed on the job. Training materials  indicate that one must weigh ingredients to ensure  consistency across product. However, with practice  one can judge how much lettuce should be placed  on a sandwich without weighing the lettuce, mak  ing a grill person more efficient over time. These  are examples of procedures not learned in training,  but rather as a result of experience and working  with other experienced employees (Dobbs, 2000).  As tacit knowledge increases, so does the speed  component of efficiency.  While employees are learning their roles, it is  likely that mistakes will be made. Filled orders that  do not meet customer requests must be thrown  away and replaced with the correct orders. This  process increases waste and hence, raises food  costs. As employees gain experience, their speed  should improve, and the number of bad orders (i.e., This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:57:34 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  136 Academy of Management Journal February  those that do not meet customer specifications and  must be thrown away) should diminish. The food  service industry generally has standardized opera  tions (strict operating policies and procedures), yet  rampant turnover can prevent restaurants from op  erating at peak efficiency, as at any point in time  someone on the floor is likely to be new to the job  and lacks both explicit and tacit knowledge. Hence,  efficiency is reduced as constant turnover increases  waste and slows service time (Carbone, 1995).  Hypothesis 2. Crew turnover is related to  longer customer wait time.  Hypothesis 3. Crew turnover is related to  higher food waste.  Although knowledge transfer is important for  training new employees, knowledge transfer in its  purest form may lead to inefficiencies, since it is  unnecessary for each individual to have a full  working knowledge of every other organization  member's tasks (Berman, Down, & HrH, 2002;  Grant, 1996). Knowledge integration or coordina  tion provides a better way to utilize the specialized  talents of members of the work team. Such coordi  nation is accomplished through rules and direc  tives, sequencing, and routines (Grant, 1996). Rou  tines are relatively automatic patterns of behavior  that support team member interactions with little  or no verbal communication (Winter, 1986). Estab  lishing routines is critical for success in fast food  restaurants (Leidner, 1993). Building and motivat  ing smooth work teams may be especially challeng  ing for new managers as they are less familiar with  each individual's work habits and abilities. Creat  ing schedules that satisfy current employees, as  well as training new employees, may be difficult  for managers who themselves are "learning the  ropes." Frequent managerial turnover can limit the  ability of a work team to function in a synchronized  manner, as a new manager may be less adept at  building and motivating a team (Berman et al.,  2002). This notion is consistent with Staw's (1980)  suggestion that the higher the level at which turn  over occurs in the organizational hierarchy, the  greater the possibility of operational disruptions.  Thus, it is likely that changes in management can  also reduce efficiency.  Hypothesis 4. Manager turnover is related to  longer customer wait time.  Hypothesis 5. Manager turnover is related to  higher food waste.  EFFICIENCY AND PERFORMANCE  Contingency theory suggests that organizational  performance is a result of the fit between internal  attributes of an organization and external demands  of its environment (Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967). Past  research has shown that organizations with good  performance experience a closer fit with relevant  parts of their environments than organizations with  poor performance (Burton, Lauridson, & Obel,  2002; Lawrence & Lorsch, 1967). In the food service  industry, consumers and competitors represent the  environment (Lawrence & Lorsch, 1969). Internal  attributes of these organizations include goal orien  tation, time horizon, reliance on formal rules and  communication channels, and interpersonal style  (Lawrence & Lorsch, 1969). In restaurants, it can be  argued that consistency is crucial to meeting cus  tomer expectations, and heavy reliance on formal  rules, policies, and procedures would be expected.  The more an organization is structured to meet the  demands of consumers, the better the organization  will perform.  The coalignment of an organization and its envi  ronment is achieved through strategic choice  (Miles & Snow, 1978). Child (1972) argued that a  firm has an interactive relationship with its envi  ronment and does not necessarily react to it.  Rather, managers of the firm in part create the en  vironment through strategic choices (i.e., major de  cisions). In the food service industry, strategic  choices may involve products, markets, and oper  ations. For example, one goal of the fast-food in  dustry is prompt service. Indeed, evidence suggests  that a six-second reduction in transaction speed  results in a 1 percent increase in revenue (Ankeny,  2001). Accordingly, many of the decisions made in  the fast-food industry have the sole purpose of de  creasing customer wait time. A decade ago, point  of-sale (POS) systems and touch screens were inte  grated into many restaurants. The introduction of  these systems was vital in improving communica  tion between the counter and the kitchen (Duro  cher, 1993). A more recent innovation undertaken  by the major fast-food companies (Burger King, Mc  Donald's, and Wendy's) was to install a credit card  system that requires no signature or personal iden  tification number (PIN). Their reluctance to accept  credit cards in the past stemmed from concerns about  slower service times and bottlenecks (Liddle, 2003).  The service quality literature suggests timely re  sponsiveness to customer demands is an important  aspect of perception of service quality (Hightower,  Brady, & Baker, 2002; Houston, Bettencourt, &  Wenger, 1998; Katz, Larson, & Larson, 1991). Both  customer retention and profitability have been pos This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:57:34 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2006 Kacmar, Andrews, Van Rooy, Steilberg, and Cerrone 137  itively related to perceptions of service quality  (Zeithaml, 2000). Speed of service often has been  operationalized as customer wait time and has been  empirically linked with perceptions of service  quality (Houston et al., 1998).  Two primary determinants of efficiency in the  fast-food industry are speed of service and food  waste. Since production efficiencies stem from  increased output relative to input or reduced in  put relative to output (Fabricant, 1969), organi  zations that can shorten wait times while holding  down food waste will realize higher performance  than those with longer wait times and higher levels of  waste.  Hypothesis 6. Customer wait time is negatively  related to sales.  Hypothesis 7. Customer wait time is negatively  related to profit.  Hypothesis 8. Food waste is negatively related  to profit.  METHODS  Sample and Data Collection Procedures  Our data were collected from 262 of the 583  (45%) corporately owned BURGER KING? restau  rants over a two-year period representing the com  pany's 2001 and 2002 fiscal years. Restaurants in  cluded in this study were located in the continental  United States and had complete data over the two  year period. If a restaurant did not have data for all  periods (if, for instance, a restaurant was closed for  a one-month remodeling), it was excluded from the  analyses. No other qualifiers were used for restau  rant selection. Data were collected via the POS  system installed in each restaurant. This system  measures sales as they occur. In addition, it allows  managers to record the employee entrances and  departures (turnover actions) that occur in their  restaurant. The POS system feeds all of the data to  a central database that is routed to the BKC restau  rant support center.  Measures  Turnover. Crew turnover was the monthly per  centage of turnover of hourly employees in fiscal  2001. We obtained this value by dividing the num  ber of terminations by the average hourly employee  restaurant headcount during that same period.  Management turnover, measured using the same  formula as crew turnover, represented the monthly  turnover of salaried employees. To create the spec  ified time lags for the turnover rates, we split the  fiscal year in half for both crew and management,  measuring average turnover for the first six months  of fiscal 2001. Crew turnover included only volun  tary job departures (voluntary turnover) as prelim  inary results indicated that voluntary and involun  tary turnover produced different results,2 but only  voluntary turnover was consistent with our theo  retical arguments. However, we were unable to dis  tinguish between voluntary and involuntary turn  over for managers as the data were unavailable.  Blending the two types of turnover, while not ideal,  is not unprecedented (Glebbeek & Bax, 2004; Koys,  2001; McElroy, Morrow, & Rude, 2001; Simons &  Roberson, 2003).  Efficiency. Efficiency was measured in two  ways. The first measure was customer wait time,  the period of time from when a customer ordered  to the delivery of food. To assess wait time, we  used scores assigned to each restaurant by mys  tery shoppers, who are employees of outside  agencies retained by BKC. These shoppers clan  destinely rate the restaurants on a number of  relevant metrics determined by BKC. One of  these metrics is wait time, which was timed and  recorded by the mystery shoppers. Each restau  rant received at least one mystery shopper per  month. Thus, all restaurants received a minimum  of 12 mystery shopper scores for the year, and we  averaged these scores to obtain customer wait  time for fiscal year 2001. The second measure of  efficiency was the average food waste for fiscal  2001. We determined this value by comparing  food inventory at the beginning of the month  with monthly sales to determine the inventory  carried over at the end of the month. For exam  ple, if a store had 100 WHOPPER? patties at the  beginning of the month and sold 75 WHOPPERS?  during that month, then 25 patties should have  remained in inventory at the end of the month. If  fewer than 25 remained, some WHOPPERS? had  been prepared and wasted rather than sold. Thus,  the more closely the depleted food inventory  matched sales, the less waste and the more effi  cient the store.  Performance. Financial performance was mea  sured in two ways. First, gross monthly sales were  collected from each of the 262 stores via the POS  system. We combined the monthly sales to obtain  average sales for fiscal 2002. Profit, a second mea  sure of performance, was measured using an index  referred to as restaurant operating profit before oc  cupancy (ROPO), calculated by adjusting gross  sales for expenses such as utilities, advertising, re  2 These analyses are available from the first author.

ROPO was measured for the same  period and averaged in the same fashion as sales.  For the sake of clarity and consistency with other  literature, we refer to this measure of operating  profit before occupancy as profit.  Control variables. We included two control vari  ables in our analyses. The first was restaurant site  quality. BKC assigns each restaurant a value based  on a formula that rates key issues associated with  restaurant location. For example, restaurants with  easy access, locations on busy corners, or locations  with a high volume of foot traffic score higher than  stores that do not have these attributes. We linked  site quality to both management and crew turnover  as well as both performance measures, as we sus  pected that stores with high site quality ratings are  more attractive to both managers and crew and  generate higher sales and profit. Our second control  variable was size, measured as a store's number of  employees. This measure was used as a control for  both sales and profit.3  Analyses  We used structural equation modeling to test our  hypotheses, employing the software AMOS 5.0 (Ar  buckle, 2003) to estimate all models. We refer to  several fit statistics to provide an accurate overall  picture of model fit (Bollen & Long, 1993). These  include the overall chi-square value, the compara  tive fit index (CFI), the normed fit index (NFI), and  the root-mean-square error of approximation  (RMSEA).  RESULTS  We began by transforming Figure 1 into the struc  tural model shown in Figure 2. This model was  estimated first and served as our baseline model for  comparison purposes (model 1). To confirm that  our hypothesized time lags were appropriate, we  tested the model without lags (Glebbeek & Bax,  2004). Specifically, the model was estimated with  values for all variables from fiscal 2001 (model 2)  and then again with fiscal 2002 values (model 3).  Table 1 shows results from these models. As the  RMSEA shows, neither of these models fitted the  data as well as the hypothesized model, indicating  support for our use of a lagged model. We also  tested our assumption that turnover had no imme  3 We explored including local unemployment rate as a  control variable, but found it to have little explanatory  power.  diate effect on efficiency by substituting fiscal 2001  efficiency in our baseline model with fiscal 2002  efficiency and reestimating the model (model 4).  Again, results supported our contention, as the  links between turnover and efficiency became in  significant. Finally, we explored the length of time  it took for inefficiencies to appear in the financial  performance indicators. After first demonstrating  that measuring financial performance in the same  fiscal year as turnover and efficiency was not ap  propriate, we tested two additional performance  time frames for fiscal 2002: the first six months  (model 5) and the last six months (model 6). Al  though the chi-square and RMSEA for model 6  were slightly lower than those for the other two  models, we viewed the results for all three models  as essentially interchangeable. To create the stron  gest measure of performance, one including all pos  sible seasonal fluctuations in sales, we measured  performance for the full year.  Having established that our time lags were appro  priate, we then examined our assumption of a fully  mediated model. To do this we estimated two par  tially mediated models for comparison purposes. In  one model we added direct paths from manage  ment turnover to performance (model 7), and in the  other we added direct links from crew turnover to  performance (model 8). Results provided in Table 1  show that the difference in the chi-squares of the  partially and fully mediated models was not signif  icant and that none of the new paths were signifi  cant. Although the nonsignificant chi-square differ  ence tests suggest that the models are  interchangeable, the fact that the additional paths  were not significant suggests that full rather than  partial mediation is the most appropriate depiction  of the relationships in the model. These analyses  help answer the first two questions motivating our  study in that they show turnover does affect unit  level performance and that efficiency mediates the  relationship of performance to turnover.  Next we explored the specific links in the model  to determine whether our hypotheses were sup  ported. The correlations in Table 2 offered prelim  inary support for most of our hypotheses. As ex  pected, management turnover was positively and  significantly correlated with crew turnover (Hy  pothesis 1) and customer wait time (Hypothesis 4),  but not food waste (Hypothesis 5). Crew turnover  was positively and.significantly related to both ef  ficiency measures (Hypotheses 2 and 3). In addi  tion, both efficiency measures were negatively and  significantly correlated with both performance  measures (Hypotheses 6-8). Next, we examined the  links in Figure 2 to further test our hypotheses.  Of control variables, restaurant site quality was This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:57:34 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2006  Kacmar, Andrews, Van Rooy, Steilberg, and Cerrone  139  Standardized Path Loadings of the Impact of Turnover on Unit-Level Performance  FIGURE 2  Significant Paths -  Insignificant Paths .  not significantly related to either measure of turn  over, but the paths from site quality to sales and  performance were both significant. As expected,  size (number of employees) was significantly re  lated to sales and profit. As for the predicted rela  tionships, management turnover was positively  and significantly related to crew turnover, demon  strating support for Hypothesis 1. Crew turnover  was significantly related to both wait time and food  waste, indicating support for Hypotheses 2 and 3.  On the other hand, management turnover was pos  itively and significantly related to wait time but not  to food waste. Thus, Hypothesis 4 was supported,  but Hypothesis 5 was not.  Moving on to the efficiency-performance link, we  found that customer wait time was significantly  and negatively related to both sales and profit, find  ings lending support for Hypotheses 6 and 7. The  second efficiency variable, food waste, was not sig  nificantly related to profit, so no support for Hy  pothesis 8 was provided.  Finally, we address the third question that moti  vated our study: What is the value of a stable work  force? This value can be estimated in multiple  ways. One way is to examine the indirect effects  shown in Figure 2. Specifically, one can multiply  and then sum the path coefficients that represent  the indirect effects on each of the ultimate depen  dent variables to determine what percentage  change in the standard deviation of performance  (i.e., sales or profit) corresponds to a one-standard  deviation change in turnover (Kenny, 1979). In our  case, the indirect effect of turnover on sales is -.15,  with crew turnover being responsible for ?.07 and  management turnover being responsible for -.08.  This indirect effect represents 33 percent of the  total effect of crew turnover. Examining the indi  rect effects for profit leads to similar results. The  indirect effect of turnover on profit is -.16 (-.08  for crew and -.08 for management), which repre  sents 23 percent of the total effect of management  turnover.

According to White (1995), the in  dustry-wide cost of hiring a replacement crew  member is estimated to be at least $500. Coupling  this cost with the industry average crew turnover  rate of 123 percent and the average number of em  ployees per store of 50 (Zuber, 2001), the average  cost of crew turnover would be $30,500 a year (61  new hires multiplied by $500). We believe consid  ering both the indirect and direct costs of crew  turnover clearly demonstrates the value of a stable  workforce.4  DISCUSSION  In the present study, we sought to answer three  important research questions: (1) Does turnover af  fect unit-level performance? (2) If turnover does  4 We would like to thank two of our reviewers for  suggesting these approaches.

(3) What is the value of a stable  workforce? The answer to our first question is yes,  as our study illustrated that turnover does indeed  impact unit-level performance in terms of both  sales and profit. Exactly how this happens is the  focus of our second question, concerning media  tion. We learned that efficiency, measured in terms  of customer wait time, mediated the relationship of  turnover with unit-level performance. A link be  tween turnover and performance has often been  inferred, but our results identify and operationalize  efficiency to explain this link. Turning to our third  question, we found that a stable workforce allowed  units to be efficient, and that efficiency led to stron  ger performance. In food service, an industry char  acterized by relatively standardized operations, a  stable workforce makes a firm more competitive.  We believe three theories?social exchange theory,  the knowledge-based view of organizations, and  strategic choice?help explain our results.  Our results indicate managerial turnover is pos  itively and immediately related to crew turnover.  Given the level of attractiveness of working in food  service and the often short duration of employment  in the industry, employees are more likely to de  velop loyalty to their manager than to their organ  ization. As social exchange theory suggests, if a  manager leaves an organization, his or her employ  ees no longer feel obligated to remain. This idea is  also consistent with Mueller and Price's (1989) as  sertion that managerial turnover causes disruption  and reduces behavioral commitment. Our results  confirm their suggestion that "the greater this dis  ruption in a work unit, the more likely members  will question the viability of that work unit as the  place they wish to work" (Mueller & Price, 1989:  393).  Crew turnover was related to reduced effi  ciency in the form of longer customer wait times  and higher food waste. These links provide em  pirical support for the knowledge-based view of  organizations, including its assumptions of  knowledge transfer and coordination (Grant,  1996). Specifically, the observed negative rela  tionship between crew turnover and efficiency  suggests that employees are more likely to gain  both the tacit and explicit knowledge required to  efficiently perform their jobs as their organiza  tional tenure increases. Practitioner accounts  from the quick-service food industry echo this  view, maintaining that a stable and well-trained  workforce results in a better customer experience  (Zuber, 2001). Interestingly, management turn  over produced different results than crew turn  over. Specifically, management turnover was  positively and significantly related to customer  wait time, but not food waste. It appears that the  central and most important role of a manager is to  provide an environment in which employees can  perform quickly. Managers who have experience  working with their crews are in a better position  to accomplish this task.  Finally, our results support the contention that  customer wait time has a significant and direct  effect on performance measured in terms of sales in  the fast-food industry. In keeping with theories of  strategic choice (Miles & Snow, 1978), the industry  has created consumer expectations of receiving  quality food fast, and "fastness" continues to be a  primary determinant of revenues (Ankeny, 2001). It  is difficult for inexperienced crew members to  work at the speed customers expect. Customer wait  time was negatively and significantly related to  profit, indicating that slow service resulting from  high crew turnover rates can significantly reduce  store profits.  Strengths and Weaknesses  We draw your attention to four strengths in the  present study. First, our results demonstrate what  quick-service food operators have asserted for  years: that speed is an essential component of effi  ciency and a key factor in successful performance.  Second, the data were longitudinal. This has been  noted as an important feature in turnover research  as the impact of turnover on outcomes may or may  not be immediate (Glebbeek & Bax, 2004; Mueller &  Price, 1989). Further, longitudinal data allowed us  to more rigorously test the causality implied in our  model. Third, by identifying and testing alternative  models, we were able to dismiss several plausible  alternative explanations of our data. Finally, all of  the measures were based on actual data from 262  functioning BURGER KING? restaurants, a method  that represents a departure from other studies that  have relied on key informants' recollection of data  or whose results were based on fewer units. More  over, the standardization of product, marketing, fa  cility, and procedures in these restaurants elimi  nated sources of extraneous variance, notably  improving our ability to isolate the researched  variables.  However, the study is not without limitations.  Most importantly, the data were collected from  one company doing business in one industry.  Even though the company that supplied the data  is clearly a leader in its industry, the industry  may be considered unique. For instance, many of  the restaurant employees work on a part-time  basis. Accordingly, many of these individuals This content downloaded from 131.193.251.47 on Wed, 02 Aug 2017 22:57:34 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  142 Academy of Management Journal February  may not view their job as a career, but more as a  temporary stop along the way to their desired  career path. Sentiments like these are evident in  the extraordinarily high turnover rates that  plague this industry. Although this feature made  the data especially attractive for a study of turn  over issues, the results may not generalize to  organizations outside the food service industry.  Additionally, there were two data-reporting con  straints that we could not overcome because of  lack of availability. First, although we segmented  crew turnover into voluntary and involuntary, we  were unable to do so with management turnover.  Second, the efficiency measures were only avail  able as average yearly values. However, we do not  feel that these data constraints undermine the  contribution of the study.  Managerial Implications  The results of the present study have several  important implications for managers and human  resource professionals. First, since crew stability  is strongly linked to management stability, atten  tion should be paid to improving the procedures  for selecting restaurant managers. Once key at  tributes of successful career managers have been  located, selection procedures can be developed  that isolate these characteristics in management  applicants. Effectively cloning long-term manag  ers who run profitable restaurants should lower  management turnover rates, which will ulti  mately increase performance through lower crew  turnover and shorter wait times. However, hiring  talent is just the first step. Food service organi  zations also need to find ways of improving the  work environment in order to retain their talent.  As the main reasons cited for leaving jobs in the  food service industry include poor management,  low compensation, and wanting to improve one's  quality of life (White, 1995), action steps should  be taken to improve each of these areas. Addi  tionally, since customer wait time has been iden  tified as a prominent precursor to sales and  profit, it may be worthwhile for managers to im  prove and reward this aspect of work. For in  stance, spot rewards could be given to managers  and crew at locations that consistently meet or  exceed efficiency expectations. Another ap  proach would be to conduct team-building exer  cises for new employees to help them quickly  learn tacit knowledge and develop the skills re  quired to provide efficient service. Creating a  stable team may be as important in the fast-food  industry as it is in sports. Teammates who have  worked together for some time will be able to  predict each others' moves, anticipate problems,  cover and compensate for each other, and work  seamlessly when things get busy, mitigating  losses due to inefficiencies.  In summary, we believe that this study makes an  important contribution to the organizational turn  over literature. By positioning turnover as an ante  cedent rather than a final outcome in our model, we  were able to answer three important research ques  tions: (1) Does turnover affect unit-level perfor  mance? (2) If turnover does affect unit-level perfor  mance, are there any mediating mechanisms? and  (3) What is the value of a stable workforce? As  illustrated above, the answers to these questions  have important implications for both research and  practice. Our investigation is clearly only a first  step in exploring the turnover-efficiency-perfor  mance relationship, but our hope is that these find  ings will motivate others to continue this promis  ing line of inquiry.
