This the moderating effects of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on the association between market orientation and firm perfor- mance in the context of an emerging economy. The results from a sample of firms that operate in Dubai indicate that CSR has a synergistic effect on the impact of market orientation on business performance. The results of our research on the moderating effects of CSR on market orientation subsets reveal that although CSR moderates the association between customer orientation and business performance, it does not moderate the association between competitive orientation and inter- functional coordination and performance. The results of this study are discussed, and implications for practitioners and researchers are presented. KEY WORDS: market orientation, corporate social responsibility, resource-based view, Dubai, emerging economies Introduction Unfolding the determinants of ﬁrm performance is a central aim of strategic management scholarship. For nearly two decades, the market orientation per- spective has facilitated researchers’ understanding of the link between ﬁrms’ strategy and ﬁnancial per- formance (Han et al., 1998; Jaworski and Kohli, 1996; Kirca et al., 2005; Kohli and Jaworski, 1990; Narver and Slater, 1990), customer satisfaction and retention (Narver and Slater, 1990; Slater and Narver, 1994), and employee commitment (Matsuno et al., 2002). The market orientation perspective is predicated on the assumption that ﬁrms gain and sustain their competitive advantage by effectively serving dominant stakeholders and constantly meeting the changing needs of the market (Narver and Slater, 1990). Critics argue, however, that the market orienta- tion perspective suffers from a signiﬁcant ‘‘black box’’ challenge (Ellinger et al., 2008). That is, al- though scholars have offered a number of convinc- ing arguments to assert the positive link between a ﬁrm’s market orientation and its performance (Kirca et al., 2005), the underlying determinants for this assertion remain illusive. Zhou et al. (2008, p. 985) argue that despite the strong appeal of market ori- entation, ‘‘simply assessing the direct link between market orientation and performance is not fruitful’’. Scholars contend that the relationship between market orientation and ﬁrms’ performance is an outcome of interactions amongst a number of stra- tegic actions – a topic that is much less researched (Olavarrieta and Friedmann, 2008). Scholars have recently advocated that a better understanding of the association between market orientation and perfor- mance lies in the study of market orientation as a component of a bundle of other strategic actions (Cano et al., 2004). In response to their recom- mendation, this study aims to examine the interac- tion effects of market orientation and corporate social responsibility (CSR) on performance. We chose to investigate the impact of bundling CSR activities and market orientations for several reasons. First, of all the factors that could inﬂuence the impact of market orientation, CSR is arguably one of the most central to the effectiveness of market orientation. CSR activities are crucial because an important feature of a market orientation perspective is its primary focus on a ﬁrm’s ability and willingness to serve its stakeholders. Therefore, it is plausible to argue that CSR activities may foster a favourable relationship between the ﬁrm and its customers and other dominant stakeholders. This favourable rela- tionship could ultimately strengthen the market 308 Anis Ben Brik et al. orientation–performance link (Siu, 1993). Indeed, observations of the synergistic effects of CSR and market orientation are not new. Nearly two decades ago, a seminal paper by Narver and Slater (1990) acknowledged the link between CSR and market orientation. Their research argued that since market orientation requires a clear, external orientation from organizations, ﬁrms should be sensitive to the expectations and needs of society in general, not only to those of their customers and competitors. Narver and Slater (1990, p. 34) note that ‘‘the implication of a given magnitude of market orien- tation is that a business is, to some extent, sensitive and responsive to any stakeholder or issue that may affect its long-term performance’’. They propose that future research should examine ‘‘the relation- ship between the degree of a business’s market ori- entation and the extent of its ‘social responsibility’ behavior’’ (p. 34). This study answers their call. The resource-based view (RBV) of complementary bundling amongst various practices (Sirmon et al., 2007, 2008) posits that in order for a ﬁrm to attain superior performance, its practices must ﬁt, com- plement, and support each other. By building on these insights from RBV, we make the case that market orientation activities are more likely to lead to higher performance when bundled with com- plementary activities, such as CSR. Second, whilst the study of how CSR sits with other strategic ac- tions is important in its own right, this study is of particular relevance in the current business envi- ronment where ﬁrms are expected to pursue CSR activities (Vogel, 2005). In addition to shedding light on the association between market orientation and performance, this study reﬁnes the growing body of recent research on the interaction effects of market orientation and different strategic actions on performance (Wei and Lau, 2008). One of the major shortcomings of extant studies is their treatment of market orientation as a single cohesive strategy. In this study, we unpack market orientation into its three main subsets and examine the interactive effects of CSR upon each of them. Researchers have long argued that whilst market orientation encompasses three components – consumer, competitive, and inter-functional coor- dination – ﬁrms tend to focus on some components more than others (Day and Nedungadi, 1994; Hunt and Morgan, 1995; Jaworski and Kohli, 1993; Kohli and Jaworski, 1990; Theoharakis and Hooley, 2008). Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that the combined effect of the three components is not necessarily synergistic (Grinstein, 2008) and that some subsets of market orientation may ﬁt better with other strategic options than others. Therefore, this study examines the interactive link between CSR and each subset of market orientation. In so doing, this study provides a ﬁne-grained analysis of the effects of the interaction between market ori- entation and CSR. Another key limitation of extant research is its over-reliance on ﬁnancial perfor- mance, which, in isolation, does not capture a ﬁrm’s overall performance (Husted and Allen, 2007). Market orientation literature identiﬁes three differ- ent effects: ﬁnancial performance, employee com- mitment, and corporate reputation (Jaworski and Kohli, 1993; Kohli and Jaworski, 1990). In this study, we examine the association between mar- ket orientation, CSR, and the oft-used ﬁnancial performance measure, as well as two leading per- formance indicators: employees’ commitment and corporate reputation. In so doing, we hope to pro- vide a deeper insight into the interactions between CSR and market orientation and the different per- formance outcomes. This study focuses on the association between market orientation, CSR, and ﬁrm performance in the context of an emerging economy. Given the recent adoption of market orientation (Wei and Lau, 2008) and CSR strategies by ﬁrms in emerging economies (Rettab et al., 2009), we believe that it is time to investigate the potential impact of bundling the two strategies on performance. The successful research of the effects of these strategies on ﬁrms in emerging economies closes a number of gaps in our knowledge about the association between market orientation, CSR, and performance. Compared to research in developed countries, research on the relationship between market orientation and per- formance in emerging economies is limited (Dwairi et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2008). Almost all research on the strategic value of CSR has focused on ﬁrms that operate in developed countries (Rettab et al., 2009). Whilst extant research on developed Western countries is informative, this body of research aims to greatly increase the limited insight into the impact of market orientation and CSR on performance in emerging economies. Extant research advocates that Market Orientation, CSR, and Business Performance 309 though limited, make the case for ﬁrms in emerging economies tend to adopt strategic actions in a piecemeal fashion that may lead to the adoption of incompatible and internally inconsistent strategies. Furthermore, scholars have recently ex- tolled the exploration of that link, and a number of studies, the necessity of examining the association between market orientation and performance in emerging economies (Anwar and Sohail, 2003; Dwairi et al., 2007; Kuada and Buatsi, 2005; Zhou et al., 2008). In the next section of this article, we discuss re- lated literature and develop ﬁve hypotheses. The following two sections explore our method and analyse the data, and the ﬁnal section discusses the results and limitations of this study. Literature review and hypotheses Market orientation and performance The market-oriented perspective has generated a substantive body of research over the years (Svensson, 2001). Indeed, as early as the 1950s, McKitterick (1958) highlighted the positive relationship of ﬁrms that are responsive to stakeholders’ needs, manage the competitive landscape, and coordinate their internal activities and performance. Narver and Slater (1990, p. 21) deﬁne market orientation as ‘‘the organizational culture … that most effectively and efﬁciently creates the necessary behaviors for the creation of superior value for buyers and, thus, continuous superior per- formance for the business’’. Recently, scholars have viewed market orientation as a key capability that has the potential to alter existing resources into superior performance (Hult et al., 2005; Zhou et al., 2008). There is near consensus in the literature that market orientation has a positive impact on business perfor- mance. Past research provides evidence to suggest that market orientation has a positive impact on business performance, including ﬁnancial performance (Day, 1994; Han et al., 1998; Jaworski and Kohli, 1996; Kirca et al., 2005; Kohli and Jaworski, 1990; Narver and Slater, 1990), customer satisfaction and retention (Narver and Slater, 1990), and employee commit- ment (Matsuno et al., 2002). recent studies of emerging economies conﬁrm the positive association between market orientation and performance Though limited, business (Anwar and Sohail, 2003; Dwairi et al., 2007; Kuada and Buatsi, 2005; Wei and Lau, 2008; Zhou et al., 2008). We contend that Dubai is no exception to this association between market orientation and business performance. Given Dubai’s free market economy, competition in the marketplace is the prime mechanism for achieving sustainable com- petitive advantage. Furthermore, the weak – and sometimes total absence of – regulations in Dubai facilitate ﬁerce the importance of market orientation. In particular, ﬁrms initiatives respond effectively to continuously changing consumer needs and achieve higher performance (Rettab et al., 2009). Therefore, this study proposes the following hypothesis for emerging economies. competition and increase that develop managerial H1: Market orientation has a positive association with business performance. Market orientation, CSR, and performance Central to this study’s thesis is the concept of ‘‘ﬁt’’ or complementary bundling amongst the various stra- tegic actions (Sirmon et al., 2007, 2008). For supe- rior performance to occur, the different strategic actions must ﬁt, complement, and support each other. According to the RBV theory, the perfor- mance of ﬁrms largely depends on their ability to coordinate their strategic actions and bundle resources and capabilities in an effective yet efﬁcient manner (Barney, 1991). An effective bundling of resources and capabilities produces what Teece et al. (1997, p. 509) call ‘‘the ﬁrm’s portfolio of difﬁcult- to-trade knowledge assets’’, which gives ﬁrms a sustainable competitive advantage. the extensive research on ﬁrms’ resources and capabili- ties shows that ﬁrms’ synergistic activities often yield higher beneﬁts when they are combined effectively (Black and Boal, 1994). Indeed, Theoretically, the presence of CSR may amplify the association between market orientation and performance, because CSR reinforces consumer and employee trust in the organisation. Scholars argue that CSR gives market orientation activities a humanistic touch that may improve consumers’ perception of al., 2007; Bhattacharya and Sen, 2004; Du et al., 2007; the ﬁrm (Barone et 310 Anis Ben Brik et al. Sen et al., 2006; Vogel, 2005; Webb et al., 2007). McWilliams and Siegel (2001, p. 120) note that CSR ‘‘creates a reputation that a ﬁrm is reliable and honest’’. Furthermore, CSR increases employee commitment to the organisation, which ultimately enhances performance (Albinger and Freeman, 2000; Backhaus et al., 2002; Greening and Turban, 2000; Maignan et al., 1999; Peterson, 2004; Turban and Greening, 1997). Taken together, we contend that even though market orientation itself may yield high business performance, market orientation is likely to result in even higher performance when bundled with complementary activities, such as CSR. Therefore, the combination of market ori- entation and CSR has the potential to generate higher performance for organisations. H2: CSR has a positive inﬂuence on the relationship between market orientation and business per- formance such that at a higher level of CSR, market orientation has a stronger association with performance than at a lower level of CSR. Market orientation subsets, CSR, and performance to a ﬁrm’s use of By building on past research (Jaworski and Kohli, 1993; Kohli and Jaworski, 1990), we conceptualise market orientation as a tripod for success that consists of three components: customer orientation, com- petitor orientation, and inter-functional coordina- tion. Consumer orientation refers to the extent to which a ﬁrm identiﬁes with its target customers, often through continuous market research, and learns the best ways to serve them. Competitive ori- entation refers its capabilities, strengths, and weaknesses vis-a`-vis its competitors. Inter-functional coordination refers to the level and magnitude of information sharing and coordination amongst the different levels and functions within a ﬁrm (Song and Montoya-Weiss, 2001). Researchers have long asserted that, whilst market orientation encompasses these three subsets of components, or- ganisations tend to focus on some components more than others. As discussed below, CSR ﬁts some market orientation subsets better than others; therefore, one would expect some interactive effects to be different. That is, the interactive effects of CSR with market orientation depend on the level of congruity between the subsets of market orientation and CSR activities. Below, we propose three hypotheses on the possible outcomes of the inter- active effects of CSR with customer orientation, competitive orientation, and inter-functional orien- tation. and friendly after-sale service’’ Customer orientation: CSR and performance Customer orientation refers to the degree to which ﬁrms seek to understand and satisfy their core cus- tomers’ needs (Donavan et al., 2004; Theoharakis and Hooley, 2008), which includes delivering products safely and reliably, helping customers to make the right purchase, and ‘‘providing responsive, fair (Liao and Subramony, 2008). Although customer orientation focuses on achieving superior customer satisfaction (Kirca et al., 2005), the process through which this is attained is congruent with the primary aim of CSR activities. Providing safe and reliable products or offering effective after-sale services helps ﬁrms to carry out customer orientation activities whilst pursuing CSR objectives. In general, a ﬁrm’s pre- disposition to meeting customers’ needs sits com- fortably with its quest to be a socially responsible organisation. What is even more promising is that research shows that employees – salespeople in particular – are more committed to their organisa- tion, have higher levels of job satisfaction, and are more enthusiastic about market orientation activi- ties when they perceive their ﬁrm’s activities as socially responsible (Bhattacharya and Sen, 2003; McWilliams and Siegel, 2001). Their enthusiasm comes from the fact that employees generally have an ethical and responsible tendency or predisposition to meet customer needs (McWilliams and Siegel, 2001). Based on the aforementioned discussion of the synergistic combination of the two practices, this study predicts that, when combined, customer ori- entation and CSR have a synergistic effect on business performance. H3: CSR has a positive inﬂuence on the relation- ship between customer orientation and per- formance such that at a higher level of CSR, the association between customer orientation and performance is stronger than at a lower level of CSR. Market Orientation, CSR, and Business Performance 311 Competitive orientation: CSR and performance Competitive orientation is deﬁned as a ﬁrm’s efforts to monitor its rivals’ activities, resources, and capa- bilities, and how the ﬁrm seeks to outperform its rivals or to remove its rivals from the competitive arena. Competitive orientation fosters an aggressive culture that emphasises winning and outperforming at any cost. Thus, we contend that competitive orientation actions are not always congruent with CSR activities, because CSR is not essential to the success of competitive orientation activities (Cottrill, 1990). Rather, under the pressure to outperform competitors, organisational members may pay less attention to the well-being of some of its core stakeholders and its wider society. As a result, a ﬁrm may reduce CSR to organisational rhetoric that could ultimately do the ﬁrm more harm than good. Furthermore, is plausible that organisational members may not be able to align their efforts of achieving the ultimate goal of outperforming com- petitors at any cost and being socially responsible (Mellahi et al., 2009). Consequently, CSR may become a distraction to an aggressively competitive ﬁrm, as its members must pay lip service and pretend to display CSR-oriented attitudes whilst they would rather be conducting other types of performance tasks. Therefore, we argue that if a ﬁrm bundles activities such as competitive orientation and CSR, this bundling is likely to lead to diminished business performance. that are not complementary, it H4: CSR has a negative inﬂuence on the rela- tionship between competitive orientation and performance such that at a higher level of CSR, competitive orientation has a negative relationship with performance, and at a lower level of CSR, competitive orientation has a positive relationship with performance. Inter-functional orientation: CSR and performance Inter-functional orientation refers to the degree of communication and interaction amongst organisa- tional members in their pursuit to offer superior value to customers (Im and Workman, 2004). Narver and Slater (1990) argue that cross-function coordination helps ﬁrms to acquire, integrate, and disseminate market systematically, which, in turn, helps them to develop innovative intelligence therefore, marketing programs to serve customers. CSR and fundamentally inter-functional orientation address separate activities; their combination would not have a synergistic effect on performance. Although inter-functional orientation may help individuals who are keenly aware of and enthusiastic about CSR to disseminate such activities across functions, the two sets of activities do not synergis- tically interact to improve business performance. H5: CSR does not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the relationship between inter-functional orienta- tion and performance. Data collection The sampling frame consisted of 2,200 companies that were drawn from the membership database of the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI). Each of the 2,200 questionnaires was e-mailed and/or faxed to a top manager in each ﬁrm along with a letter that explained the nature of the study and promised conﬁdentiality. Three weeks after the original mailing, the researchers sent two follow-up distributions, which included duplicate cover letters and questionnaires, to all ﬁrms that did not respond. Repeated follow-ups were sent 3 weeks after each previous mailing. This study used Armstrong and Overton’s (1977) extrapolation procedure to assess non-response bias. The analysis did not show signiﬁcant differences between early and late respondents. The response rate was 14% (310 ﬁrms). A total of 280 ﬁrms remained in the sample after we eliminated those that missed market orientation, CSR, and/or business performance data, resulting in a ﬁnal response rate of 13%. Measures Independent variables Market orientation: We used Narver and Slater’s (1990) scale to measure market orientation (see Deng and Dart, 1994; Deshpande´ and Farley, 1998; Deshpande´ et al., 1993; Pelham, 2000; Ruekert, 1992). All items are scored on a 5-point scale in 312 Anis Ben Brik et al. which 1 equals ‘‘strongly disagree’’ and 5 equals ‘‘strongly agree’’. All Cronbach as are above the threshold of 0.72. CSR: This study used the well-established con- struct developed by Maignan and Ferrell (2004) to measure CSR: a 26-item scale for six CSR practices, including community responsibility, environmen- tal responsibility, employee responsibility, investor responsibility, customer responsibility, and supplier responsibility. Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which each item reﬂected their organisation by applying a 5-point Likert scale with 1 equalling ‘‘strongly disagree’’ and 5 equalling ‘‘strongly agree’’. The scale reliabilities (Cronbach as) are: community responsibilities (a 4-item scale, Cronbach a = 0.87), environmental responsibilities (a 4-item scale, a = 0.83), employee responsibilities (a 5-item scale, a =0.78), investor responsibilities (a 4-item scale, a = 0.78), customer responsibilities (a 4-item scale, a = 0.85), and supplier responsibilities (a 5-item scale, a = 0.78). Dependent variable One of the key limitations of extant research is researchers’ over-reliance on ﬁnancial performance, which, in isolation, does not capture a given ﬁrm’s overall performance (Husted and Allen, 2007). This study adopted a measure of business perfor- mance, which includes three indicators: ﬁnancial performance, employee commitment, and corpo- rate reputation. For ﬁnancial performance, the seven items: a one-item scale survey includes developed by Samiee and Roth (1992), along with four speciﬁc performance items that assess market share, growth, proﬁtability, and size (adapted from the scale by Deshpande´ et al., 1993). This study also used two additional to assess general performance and performance relative to competi- tors (adapted from Jaworski and Kohli, 1993). Respondents reported the extent to which their organisation’s return on investment, return on as- sets, sales growth, and proﬁt growth had been substantially better over the last year in relation to their most relevant competitors. items We used three items adapted from a scale devel- oped by Fombrun et al. (2000) to measure execu- tives’ perceptions of their ﬁrms’ reputations, and (1993) Jaworski and Kohli’s three-item scale to measure employee commitment. A number of scholars (Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Weigelt and Camerer, 1988) argue that ﬁrms that possess positive reputations have a competitive edge over their rivals. We asked respondents to indicate the extent to which each item reﬂected their organisation by using a 5-point Likert scale (1 equals ‘‘strongly disagree’’ to 5 equals ‘‘strongly agree’’). The Cronbach as for ﬁnancial performance, corporate reputation, and employee commitment were 0.85, 0.70, and 0.84, respectively. The business performance measure combined the three measures – ﬁnancial perfor- mance, employee commitment, and reputation – into a single calculation. Control variables This study controlled for three variables that are reported to have a signiﬁcant impact on the effects of market orientation and CSR on business perfor- mance. First, past research provides evidence that the size of a ﬁrm has an impact on the association be- tween market orientation (Liu, 1995), CSR (Moore, 2001; Preston, 1978; Stanwick and Stanwick, 1998), and business performance. Stakeholders expect more social initiatives from large corporations than from small ones. For example, large multinationals and publicly traded companies are pressured to display a commitment to CSR as a result of consumer and shareholder activism against large multinationals (Drawbaugh, 2001; Klein, 1999). Furthermore, small ﬁrms are less able than their large counterparts to communicate their CSR activities to external stakeholders. Thus, this study controlled for the size of the ﬁrm and measured size by the number of employees. Second, the relationship between market orien- tation and performance depends on the sector of activities (Sanzo et al., 2003). Further, Kolk (2003) reported that different types of industries will have varying propensities to engage in CSR initiatives. Thus, this study controlled for the sector of activi- ties. Third, consistent with past research (Delaney and Huselid, 1996; Sanzo et al., 2003), this study controlled for the age of the ﬁrm. This study mea- sured age by the number of years since the ﬁrm’s establishment in Dubai. Market Orientation, CSR, and Business Performance 313 Sample characteristics and descriptive statistics The sample comprised 61 manufacturing ﬁrms; 51 trading and repair services ﬁrms; 64 hotels and res- taurants; 65 real estate, property management, and business services ﬁrms; 18 educational organisations; 17 banking and ﬁnancial services ﬁrms; 2 mining ﬁrms; and 2 ﬁrms that were unable to classify their sector of activity. The executives who responded had been with their ﬁrms for an average of 11 years and represented ﬁrms that had existed for an average of 18 years and employed an average of 276 indi- viduals. Table I presents the means, standard deviation, and correlations amongst the different sets of vari- ables that we used to test our hypotheses. Correla- tions amongst business performance, CSR, and the three components of market orientation are signiﬁ- cantly interrelated, suggesting a potential association amongst these variables. Analysis1 analyses the hypotheses include a hierarchical regression Our examination to test (Cohen and Cohen, 1983). Following Cohen and Cohen (1983), our analyses standardised all variables to reduce the potential effects of multicollinearity. The analyses employed a mean-centring procedure for the vari- ables of CSR, business performance, market orien- tation, customer orientation, competitor orientation, and inter-functional coordination. In turn, the var- iance inﬂation factor for each of the regression coefﬁcients was well below the recommended threshold of 10 (lowest = 1.04, highest = 4.89) (Neter et al., 1985), indicating that multicollinearity does not affect the weights of the controls or the hypothesised variables (Mason and Perreault, 1991). As a ﬁrst step in testing the hypotheses, we en- tered CSR and control variables, including industry sector (IS), ﬁrm size (FS), and ﬁrm age (FA), as a block, followed by the main effects of market ori- entation (MO) and the interaction effects of CSR and MO. Speciﬁcally, this study analysed the fol- lowing regression equation in three hierarchical steps: Y ¼ a þ b1X1 þ b2X2 þ b3X3 þ b4X4 þ b5X5 þ b6X4X5 þ e ð1Þ where Y is the business performance (BP), a is the intercept, X1 is the industry sector (IS), X2 is the ﬁrm size, X3 is the ﬁrm age, X4 is the CSR, X5 is the market orientation (MO), and e is the random disturbance terms. Although this study did not hypothesise the relationship between CSR and business perfor- mance, the ﬁrst step of this study tested this rela- tionship by entering control variables (industry sector, ﬁrm size, and ﬁrm age) and CSR. The results show a signiﬁcant positive association between CSR and business performance, which explains 32% of the variance in business performance as F (4,181) = 21.2, p < 0.05.

The results (F = 21.6, p < 0.05, R2 = 0.37). In step 3, this study tested hypothesis 2 by examining the interactive effects of CSR 9 MO, (Model 3). The results were statistically signiﬁcant. The inclusion of the interaction terms in step 3 explained 40% of the variance in business performance, F (6,181) = 19.06, p < 0.05, and a very small signiﬁcant variance beyond step 2 (A¨ = 0.02, p < 0.05), providing support for R(CSR 9 MO) hypothesis 2. The results are presented in Table II. To further explore the interactive effects of CSR and market orientation on each of the three performance measures (i.e. ﬁnancial performance, corporate rep- utation, and employee commitment), we repeated the above steps by applying single performance measures. To reduce the amount of visual documentation, we summarised the regression results in a single table (Table III) to depict only the full models. Table III reveals that whilst CSR signiﬁcantly moderates the relationships between market orientation, ﬁnancial performance, and corporate reputation, it has no moderating effects on employee commitment. To explore the direction of these signiﬁcant interactions, we plotted the different interactions (Aiken and West, 1991). We set the level of CSR at one standard deviation above and below the mean. All control variables are ﬁxed at their means. Figure 1 reveals that, at a high level of CSR, the association between market orientation and business performance is positive and strong. However, as indicated by the ﬂat slope, the strength of the association between market orientation and business performance dimin- ishes signiﬁcantly at a low level of CSR. Thus, hypothesis 2 is supported. Figures 2 and 3 reveal that, at a high level of CSR, the associations between market orientation and ﬁnancial performance and corporate reputation are positive and strong; how- ever, the strength of these associations is greatly diminished and becomes insigniﬁcant at a low level of CSR, thus providing further support for hypothesis 2. To test hypotheses 3, 4, and 5, this study exam- ined the interaction effects of CSR, customer orientation, competitor orientation, and inter-func- tional coordination (see Table IV).

After controlling for sectors, size, and age and entering CSR, CSO, CPO, and IFC in four simul- taneous steps, explaining signiﬁcant variance in business performance of 32%, 34%, 38%, and 40%, respectively, F (4,181) = 21.2, p < 0.05; F (5,181) = 18.19, p < 0.05; F (6,181) = 18.26, p < 0.05; and F (7,181) = 16.33, p < 0.05, the analysis simulta- neously included the interaction terms CSR 9 CSO, CSR 9 CPO, and CSR 9 IFC.

Speciﬁcally, this study examines the moderating effects of CSR and proposes that CSR activities have a synergistic inﬂuence on the rela- tionship between market orientation and business performance. The results provide support for this article’s core proposition and demonstrate that the association with performance is strongest when market orientation and CSR are bundled together. These ﬁndings support previous studies in RBV and dynamic capabilities literature that advocate a bundling hypothesis. Furthermore, recent market orientation studies that bundling market orientation with other compatible management activities is likely to enhance business performance (Baker and Sinkula, 1999; Matsuno and Mentzer, 2000; Wei and Lau, 2008). Our results speciﬁcally reveal that the association between market orienta- tion and business performance is stronger at a high level of CSR than at a low level of CSR. This means that high levels of CSR and market orientation lead to optimal performance levels. Given the lack of consensus on how and even whether or not CSR affects business performance (Husted and Allen, 2007; Margolis and Walsh, 2001, 2003; McWilliams and Siegel, 2000; Orlitzky and Benjamin, 2001; Orlitzky et al., 2003; Wright and Ferris, 1997), these results provide support for the positive impact of CSR on performance. For practitioners, these results suggest that organisations ought to view CSR and market orientation as synergistic rather than as two strategies that compete for resources. These ﬁndings are particularly important in the context of an emerging economy in which a number of scholars have made a case for a negative effect of CSR on business performance. Their argument is predicated on the assumption that CSR is incompatible with market strategies in emerging economies due to the absence of strong institutional support for CSR and the presence of weak and ineffectual laws to guard against unethical practices. Firms in emerging economies may not capture rents from their CSR activities, and such activities may even put ﬁrms at a competitive disadvantage vis-a`-vis their competitors (Foo, 2007). Rettab et al. (2009) note that, due to the lack of communication platforms for dissemi- nating information about CSR activities in emerging economies, CSR efforts often go unnoticed and are Figure 3. Market orientation and corporate reputation by CSR. The results in Table IV reveal that CSR signiﬁ- cantly moderates the association between customer orientation and ﬁnancial performance, but this effect only partially supports hypothesis 3, as this moderation becomes insigniﬁcant in the full model (Model 7). The results show no signiﬁcant interactive effects between CSR and the other two subsets of market orientation, thus rejecting hypothesis 4 and support- ing hypothesis 5. To further explore these results, we conducted additional analyses on the association be- tween CSR, market orientation, and the three per- formance measures: ﬁnancial performance, corporate reputation, and employee commitment. The results in Table V show that all interactions are insigniﬁcant, with the exception of the relationship between cus- tomer orientation and ﬁnancial performance, thus lending further support for hypothesis 3. We plotted the signiﬁcant interaction between customer orientation and ﬁnancial performance in order to explore the directions of the interaction. Figure 4 reveals that, at a low level of CSR, customer orientation has a signiﬁcant negative moderating ef- fect on ﬁnancial performance. However, this associ- ation becomes positive, albeit weak, at a high level of CSR. Discussion This study advocates the need for strategy scholars to look beyond the main effects, such as market ori- entation and ﬁrm performance, in their examination of associations between strategic actions. The core argument of this study is that strategic actions do not Market Orientation, CSR, and Business Performance 317 V I E L B A T e c n a m r o f r e p s s e n i s u b d n a , R S C , s t e s b u s n o i t a t n e i r o t e k r a M e u l a v - t b e u l a v - t b e u l a v - t b e u l a v - t b e u l a v - t b e u l a v - t b e u l a v - t b 7 l e d o M 6 l e d o M 5 l e d o M 4 l e d o M 3 l e d o M 2 l e d o M 1 l e d o M s r o t c a F 5 7 . 5 2 3 . 1 - 0 5 . 0 - 8 7 . 1 - 5 6 . 1 0 8 . 5 9 0 . 0 - 2 3 . 1 - 3 0 . 0 - 1 5 . 0 - 1 1 . 0 - 8 7 . 1 - 5 6 . 1 2 1 . 6 8 0 . 0 - 2 3 . 1 - 3 0 . 0 - 2 6 . 0 - 1 1 . 0 - 2 7 . 1 - 0 7 . 1 4 6 . 6 8 0 . 0 - 6 2 . 1 - 4 0 . 0 - 7 3 . 0 - 1 1 . 0 - 9 5 . 1 - 8 0 . 0 - 9 3 . 1 - 9 0 . 0 - 6 3 . 1 - 9 0 . 0 - 6 3 . 1 - 2 0 . 0 - 4 4 . 0 - 3 0 . 0 - 2 7 . 0 - 5 0 . 0 - 4 5 . 0 - 0 1 . 0 - 9 6 . 1 - 1 1 . 0 - 6 0 . 2 - 3 1 . 0 - 0 0 . 2 - 9 0 . 0 - 4 0 . 0 - 3 1 . 0 - 2 8 . 1 1 7 . 6 5 8 . 1 8 1 . 8 9 1 . 2 3 0 . 0 1 4 4 . 2 ) P B ( e c n a m r o f r e p s s e n i s u B 4 9 . 5 * 3 4 . 0 5 9 . 5 * 3 4 . 0 2 9 . 5 * 2 4 . 0 6 7 . 5 * 1 4 . 0 4 3 . 6 * 4 4 . 0 0 9 . 6 * 9 4 . 0 9 7 . 8 * 6 5 . 0 ) R S C ( 9 0 . 3 0 6 . 1 * 2 2 . 0 5 1 . 0 0 1 . 3 7 6 . 1 1 0 . 0 - 0 0 . 0 4 0 . 0 - * 2 2 . 0 0 0 . 0 * * 6 1 . 0 6 1 . 3 7 6 . 1 * * 6 1 . 0 * 3 2 . 0 7 5 . 3 2 8 . 1 * * 7 1 . 0 * 6 2 . 0 3 1 . 0 - 1 0 . 0 - 9 8 . 0 - 9 0 . 0 - 9 3 . 0 5 5 . 3 * 6 2 . 0 3 0 . 0 2 1 . 2 * 5 1 . 0 ) C F I ( n o i t a n i d r o o c l a n o i t c n u f - r e t n I ) O P C ( n o i t a t n e i r o r o t i t e p m o C ) O S C ( n o i t a t n e i r o r e m o t s u C 1 5 . 1 0 2 . 0 2 2 . 2 * 8 1 . 0 0 3 . 2 * 4 1 . 0 2 7 . 0 - 6 0 . 0 - 2 7 . 0 - 6 0 . 0 - 3 1 . 0 - 2 0 . 0 - 2 4 . 0 0 0 . 0 * 9 1 . 2 1 2 0 . 0 1 0 0 . 0 2 4 . 0 * 2 6 . 3 1 2 5 . 0 1 0 0 . 0 1 4 . 0 8 2 . 5 * 3 . 5 1 0 4 . 0 3 0 . 0 * 3 3 . 6 1 2 3 . 3 8 3 . 0 4 0 . 0 * 6 2 . 8 1 1 6 . 2 1 4 3 . 0 2 0 . 0 * 9 1 . 8 1 4 8 . 4 2 3 . 0 * 2 . 1 2 O S C 9 R S C O P C 9 R S C C F I 9 R S C s n o i t c a r e t n I 2 R D 2 R F D F . 1 . 0 < p * ;

Customer orientation and ﬁnancial perfor- mance by CSR. largely unknown to stakeholders. Thus, CSR activities in emerging economies may not have an impact on performance. Further, Mellahi and Wood (2003) caution that stakeholders are often not aware of CSR activities in emerging economies and, as a result, such activities may even have a negative impact on ﬁnancial performance. Taken together, this body of literature stipulates that CSR has no place in these countries (Rettab et al., 2009). Foo (2007) argues that the dominant paradigm in emerging economies is captured by the saying: ‘‘they (competitors) are ethical, so we have the competitive edge!’’ This study challenges this no- tion by showing that the higher the level of CSR, the stronger the impact of market orientation on performance. The results, which portray the interactive effects of CSR and market orientation using different business performance measures, reveal interesting information. They show that whilst CSR has a synergistic effect on the association between market orientation and ﬁnancial performance and corpo- rate reputation, it does not moderate the association between market orientation and employee com- mitment. A plausible explanation for our results is the fact that over 80% of employees in Dubai are expatriates who are employed on short-term con- tracts in which human resource strategies are based primarily on calculative commitment with little emphasis on attitudinal dedication (Budhwar and Mellahi, 2007). In such a context, employees are unlikely to care about CSR activities as they are more attached to their home country than the host country in which CSR activities have most impact (Forstlenlechner and Mellahi, 2011). Organizations 320 Anis Ben Brik et al. may address this issue by engaging in CSR activities in expatriates home countries. In brief, the results suggest that scholars need to study the integration of market orientation with other practices in order to offer a more holistic understanding of the association between market orientation and performance. Scholars could better predict the association between market orientation and performance by taking into account the inter- active impact of the other strategic actions that are pursued by organisations. Indeed, if an organisation pursues market orientation and simultaneously en- acts practices that may cancel out its effects, the chances that market orientation will have a signiﬁ- cant impact on performance are low. For practitio- ners, these ﬁndings suggest that organisations reap more value if they bundle market orientation with complementary practices; therefore, market orien- tation and CSR should be seen as part of a bundle of practices rather than isolated components. In addition to exploring the moderation of CSR on market orientation and business performance, this study provides a more ﬁne-grained analysis of CSR by examining the interactive effects amongst CSR and the market orientation subsets. This study posits that the interactive effects of CSR on the association between market orientation and performance might vary. In so doing, it advances the body of research that states that market orientation is not a uniﬁed set of practices, and argues that CSR is more compatible with some subsets of market orientation than others. As expected, our results show that CSR moderates the performance–customer orientation relationship; however, this moderation was not signiﬁcant in the full mode. Contrary to the expectations of this study, the presumed deleterious effect of CSR on the association between competitive orientation and performance was not supported; rather, the results show that, when combined, the two practices would have no signiﬁcant impact on performance. Finally, as expected, the results show that the combination of CSR with inter-functional orientation does not lead to signiﬁcantly superior performance. These results conﬁrm our assertion that CSR interacts differently with the different market orientation subsets. Overall, the results show that the association be- tween market orientation subsets and performance, with the exception of customer orientation, did not change signiﬁcantly at different levels of CSR. These results indicate that ﬁrms are likely to beneﬁt from bundling market orientation with CSR when mar- ket orientation is approached as a holistic strategy, using its three subsets simultaneously. To shed further light on these results, we con- ducted an extensive analysis on the moderating ef- fects of CSR on the association between market orientation subsets and business performance by using different measures for business performance. The results reveal that, at a low level of CSR, cus- tomer orientation has a signiﬁcant negative moder- ating effect on ﬁnancial performance. Such an association becomes positive, albeit weak, at a high level of CSR. This result indicates that reacting to perceived customer needs to produce superior value for customers is inadequate for gen- erating higher ﬁnancial performance in the absence of CSR activities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that provides evidence to show that a high level of CSR does not only enhance perfor- mance, but even ﬁnancial performance may suffer if a ﬁrm does not pay attention to CSR issues. in order Limitations The results and their interpretation must be con- sidered in the context of this study’s limitations. Whilst the ﬁndings support the interactive effects, this study does not disentangle how CSR and mar- ket orientation and its subsets interact to inﬂuence performance. Additional ﬁne-grained research using in-depth case studies is needed to help us fully understand the dynamics and processes through which CSR and market orientation impact perfor- mance. Another major caveat of this study is that the sample draws from a fast-growing and highly com- petitive emerging economy with a unique institu- tional environment. Although we went beyond merely ﬁnancial performance and combined three different performance indicators into an overall measure of business performance, one could include new indicators, such as customer satisfaction and loyalty. It would be interesting to explore whether the ﬁndings of this study hold in other emerging economies. Furthermore, our study is based on perceptual data, and although perceptual measures of business performance are well established and widely accepted, we welcome studies that are based on Market Orientation, CSR, and Business Performance 321 objective data, particularly regarding ﬁnancial mea- sures of performance. References Note for each construct 1 Before we conducted the analysis, we subjected our constructs to a number of tests to check their reliability and validity. Following the steps used by Slater et al. (2006, p. 1226), we analysed the psychometric properties of the constructs used in this study with the conﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) using LISREL 8.80. In addition, we evaluated the ﬁt of the measurement model. Again, following Slater et al. (2006), we examined the high-or- der structure of CSR to provide empirical support for the focus on the CSR construct at the higher-order aggregate level. We assessed the construct reliability by calculating a composite reliability (CR) for each construct. We used the procedures suggested by Fornell and Larcker (1981) to calculate the CR index (CRI). Along with the reliabil- ity calculations, we also examined the parameter estimates and their associated t-values and assessed the average vari- ance extracted (AVE) (Anderson, 1982; Bagozzi and Lynn, 1982). AVE was used to gauge convergent validity (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Ping, 2004). Fornell and Larcker (1981) and Ping (2004) sug- gested that convergent measures should contain less than 50% error variance (i.e. AVE should be 0.5 or above). We used the cut-off value of 0.70 and 0.50 for CR and AVE, respectively (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988; Hair et al., 1998). The scales’ reliabilities ranged from 0.78 to 0.88, the factor loadings ranged from 0.40 to 0.92 (p < 0.01), and the AVE ranged from 0.50 to 0.89. Following the reliability analysis, we established discriminant validity by calculating the shared variances between each pair of constructs and verifying that it was lower than the AVE from the individual constructs (Bagozzi and Lynn, 1982). The shared variances between pairs of all possible scale combinations indicated that the average variances ex- tracted were higher than the associated shared variance in all cases. In other words, they are more internally corre- lated than they are with other constructs. This suggests the discriminant validity of the construct in this study. The model ﬁt was evaluated using a series of indices rec- ommended by Hu and Bentler (1999): the DELTA2 (Bollen, 1989), comparative ﬁt (CFI) (Bentler, 1990; Hu and Bentler, 1999), goodness-of-ﬁt index (GFI), Tucker– Lewis (TLI), and the root mean square error of approxi- mation (RMSEA) indices. A ﬁt to the data was achieved for the ﬁrst-order-based CFA. Aiken, L. and S. West: 1991, Multiple Regression: Testing and Interpreting Interactions (Sage, Newbury Park, CA). Albinger, H. and S.
