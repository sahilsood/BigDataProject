Journal of Business Ethics (2010) 94:279–298 DOI 10.1007/s10551-009-0264-0 Ó Springer 2009 The Interactive Effect of Internal and External Factors on a Proactive Environmental Strategy and its Inﬂuence on a Firm’s Performance Bulent Menguc Seigyoung Auh Lucie Ozanne ABSTRACT. While the literature on the effective man- agement of business and natural environment interfaces is rich and growing, there are still two questions regarding which the literature has yet to reach a definitive conclu- sion: (1) what is the interactive effect between internal and external drivers on a proactive environmental strategy (PES)? and (2) does a PES influence firm’s performance? Drawing on the resource-based view for the internal drivers’ perspective and institutional and legitimacy theo- ries for the external drivers’ perspective, this study suggests that the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on a PES is moderated by the intensity of government regulations and customers’ sensitivity to environmental issues. The authors also examine the relationship between the PES and a firm’s performance in terms of sales and profit growth. Implica- tions are discussed regarding the role of a PES in achieving a competitive advantage in the marketplace. KEY WORDS: proactive environmental strategy, entre- preneurial orientation, resource-based view, legitimacy theory, institutional pressure, stakeholder theory, natural environment in the antecedents of a ﬁrm’s Scholarly interest proactive environmental strategy (hereafter PES) and in its impact on performance has been strong and is growing exponentially (e.g., Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003). This interest is not conﬁned to the academic community. A recent report by Business for Social Responsibility (2007, pp. 11–35) offers several examples of ﬁrms engaging in PESs: (1) DuPont, a $27 billion chemical company with operations is well regarded for achieving substantial emission reductions over the last 15 years, as well as making further commitments in 75 countries, to reach 65% below the 1990-emission levels by 2010. The company considers internal capacity building important for cogenerating social beneﬁt, business opportunity, and growth in the context of climate change. (2) 3M uses a companywide system called Pollution Prevention Pays (3P) that encour- ages employees at all levels to rethink products and processes to eliminate waste. Over the last three decades, the program has generated gains every year. (3) Bayer has an executive Corporate Sustainability Board on climate change and a working group on renewable raw materials. (4) Unilever, which ﬁnds that raw materials account for up to 10 times the company’s internal emissions, gives preference to suppliers’ products with lower emissions. We deﬁne PES as a top management-supported, environmentally oriented strategy that focuses on the prevention (versus control or the reactive using of an end-of-pipe approach) of wastes, emissions, and pol- lution through continuous learning, total quality environmental management, risk taking, and plan- ning (e.g., Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003; Hart, 1995). A PES has been predominantly viewed from an internally driven (competitive) perspective, and the term is used to describe a ﬁrm’s voluntary and inno- vative activities of pollution prevention, which are initiated and championed by top management (e.g., Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003; Sharma, 2000; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). That is, we deﬁne a PES as a higher-order construct that is composed of two sub-dimensions: pollution-prevention and top management support of natural environmental issues. Although a PES has generally been approached from merely a pollution-prevention perspective, we deem that the inclusion of top management support, as a 280 Bulent Menguc et al. top-down process, is essential because winning the support and attention of top management is critical for a PES’s success. Previous researchers who have drawn on this perspective have advanced our understanding the effect of a PES on a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage (Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). Hart (1995), how- ever, in his original article on the natural resource- based framework, has proposed that a strict, internally driven perspective to a PES is limited. Hart (1995) that a PES should also accommodate an argues external, legitimacy-based perspective because a legitimacy-based perspective to a PES does not endanger competitive advantage but, in fact, further strengthens it. As a consequence, in this study, we test Hart’s proposition accommodating these two comple- mentary perspectives in the same research setting. More speciﬁcally, we examine the interaction effect between the internal perspective and the external perspective on a PES. For example, we respond to calls by researchers such as Oliver (1991, p. 710) who contends: ‘‘Research on the combined effects of resource capital and institutional capital on ﬁrm’s performance might be one approach.’’ Based on a review of the extant literature, we argue that there is a need to incorporate both the internally driven and externally driven factors to capture fully the essence of a PES. that There has been considerable research aimed at understanding the internally driven perspective of a PES by drawing on the resource-based view (RBV) of the ﬁrm (e.g., Aragon-Correa, 1998; Sharma, 2000; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). We extend this framework by positing the externally driven perspective as a moderator is expected to delineate the boundary conditions of the inﬂuence of the internally driven perspective. That is, rather than simply including the internal and external fac- tors as direct effects on a PES, our model pursues a contingency approach that explicates the contextual conditions of factor’s contribution to a PES. The externally driven per- spective draws on institutional theory and the legitimacy literature by incorporating the notion of corporate social performance (e.g., Hooghiemstra, 2000; Wilmshurst and Frost, 2000). Both the inter- nal and external perspectives, we suggest, are com- plementary and capture the extent of a ﬁrm’s social performance and responsiveness. In order to realize a the impact of an internal true and accurate understanding of the value-gen- erating role of a PES, there is a need to include the interactive effect of the two perspectives. the effect of the ﬁrm, and its derivatives In order to summarize, this study has the fol- lowing purposes. First, we develop and test a con- ceptual model that investigates how the externally driven perspective, drawing on institutional and legitimacy theories, moderates the internally driven perspective, which has its roots in the RBV of (e.g., dynamic capabilities, natural RBV, etc.) on a PES. Second, we examine the performance ramiﬁcations of a PES in terms of the sales and proﬁt growth of a ﬁrm. If a PES can enhance the sales and proﬁt growth of a ﬁrm, we deem then that this will be perceived in a positive light by managers who are contemplating whether to allocate more resources and budget to environmentally friendly strategies. We use data from various manufacturing ﬁrms in New Zealand, a country known for its commitment to advancing an environmental agenda. In the sections to follow, we revisit the existing literature on the internally driven and externally driven perspectives of a PES and integrate the two streams of research into a broader model of a PES. We then develop our model and propose our hypotheses, followed by our research methods and data analysis. Finally, we discuss our study’s theo- retical and managerial implications. Literature review In accordance with the growing scholarly interest, previous researchers have discussed at length the performance implications of a PES. The proponents of a PES have, for long, provided empirical evidence that a PES is indeed positively related to a ﬁrm’s efﬁciency and effectiveness (Russo and Fouts, 1997). There is also, however, equally convincing empirical evidence showing that a PES has no signiﬁcant performance impact (Christmann, 2000). In her study, Christmann (2000) discussed some of the noticeable methodological problems that may have contributed to the inconsistent ﬁndings in the cur- rent literature. While this scholarly debate continues, it is clear that there is a lack of agreement about what the antecedents to a PES are and how they are combined to inﬂuence a PES. A careful review, Interactive Effect of Internal and External Factors on PES 281 however, of Hart’s (1995) original proposition re- veals that two complementary perspectives of a PES exist: (1) an internally driven (or competitive) per- spective (Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003) and (2) an externally driven (or legitimacy-based) perspec- tive (Oliver, 1991). We now revisit the existing literature on each perspective, respectively, and subsequently integrate the two by positing an interaction between the two perspectives. Internally driven perspective on a proactive environmental strategy Sharma (2000, p. 683) deﬁnes a PES as ‘‘a consistent pattern of company actions taken to reduce the environmental impact of operations, not to fulﬁll environmental regulations or to conform to standard practices.’’ In addition, we add top management support to such a strategy as an important dimension of a PES because we see this strategy as a process that is top-down in nature. Thus, we deﬁne a PES as a higher-order construct that consists of two ﬁrst-order dimensions: pollution-prevention and top manage- ment support of natural environmental issues. Next, we explain the two sub-dimensions in greater detail. From a pollution-prevention perspective, a pro- active (or innovative) environmental strategy is a reﬂection of evolutionary environmental strategy models that have gone beyond the early compli- ance versus noncompliance categorizations. Previous researchers have approached PES from a pollution- prevention versus pollution-control perspective (e.g., Hart, 1995; Hart and Ahuja, 1996; Russo and Fouts, 1997), while others have taken a proactive versus reactive perspective (e.g., Aragon-Correa, 1998; Sharma, 2000; Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). Nevertheless, both approaches have highlighted the same phenomenon. That is, while a PES represents a proactive (or voluntary and innovative) approach, pollution-control reactive (or conformance/compliance) approach. A PES aims to minimize emissions, efﬂuents, and wastes. Central to a PES are continuous improvement methods that focus on well-deﬁned environmental objectives rather than relying on expensive ‘‘end-pipe’’ capital invest- ments to control emissions. As Hart (1995) has dem- onstrated, a PES provides a ﬁrm with a competitive represent strategies a advantage through lower costs, shorter cycle times, and a better utilization of resources and capabilities. From a top management supportive perspective, we posit that a ﬁrm’s adoption of a PES reﬂects top management’s commitment to natural environ- mental issues. Key behaviors on the part of the top managers include, but are not limited to: commu- nicating and addressing critical environmental issues; initiating environmental programs and policies; rewarding employees for environmental improve- ments; and contributing organizational resources to environmental (Berry and Rondinelli, 1998). initiatives strong network ties In general, top managers’ strategic leadership and their support may play a critical role in shaping an organization’s values and orientation toward natural environmental issues (Berry and Rondinelli, 1998). The building of inside and outside the industry, and acquisition of more knowledge about environmental activities may in- crease top managers’ sensitivity to environmental concerns and enable them to benchmark their ﬁrm’s environmental activities with those of competitors in the marketplace (Menon and Menon, 1997). In addition, previous researchers acknowledge the role of top management as signiﬁcant in predicting cor- porate social performance (Miles, 1987; Weaver et al., 1999). In ﬁrms that are described as ‘‘com- mercial and environmentally excellent,’’ support and involvement from top management on environ- mental issues are common (Henriques and Sadorsky, 1999; Hunt and Auster, 1990; Roome, 1992). Banerjee (1992) argues that the commitment of top management is crucial to successful environmental management. In addition, Coddington (1993) and Hart (1995) conclude that corporate vision and strong leadership are the two key facilitators of the implementation of a corporatewide, environmental management strategy. To this end, Dechant and Altman (1994, p. 9) note that ‘‘environmental leaders inspire a shared value of the organization as environmentally sustainable, creating or maintaining green values throughout the enterprise.’’ A good example of top management leadership and proac- tive involvement on environmental issues is the environmental position taken by The Body Shop and its founder Anita Roddick. Since Hart’s article ﬁrst appeared in AMR, scholars have spent signiﬁcant time and effort trying 282 Bulent Menguc et al. to understand the fundamental propositions of the natural resource-based view (NRBV). Similarly, the internally driven (or competitive) perspective has received considerable attention. More recently, this perspective has been located within the ‘‘dynamic capabilities’’ approach (Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003). Eisenhardt and Martin (2000, p. 1107) deﬁne dynamic capabilities as ‘‘the ﬁrm’s processes that use resources – especially the processes to integrate, reconﬁgure, gain and release resources – to match and even create market change. Dynamic capabilities, thus, are the organizational and strategic routines by which ﬁrms achieve new resource conﬁgurations as markets emerge, collide, split, evolve, and die.’’ According to proponents of this perspective (e.g., Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003), a PES, from a pollution-prevention and top management support- ive perspective, is consistent with the very deﬁnition of dynamic capabilities for several reasons. First, a PES shares a fundamental proposition with the NRBV in that ‘‘to the extent [that] these practices are tacit, casually ambiguous, ﬁrm speciﬁc, socially complex, path dependent, and value adding for consumers, they may provide advantage’’ (Aragon-Correa and Shar- ma, 2003, p. 74). In fact, the adoption of a PES results in a substantial competitive advantage due to (pro- cess-driven) cost advantages (Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003; Hart, 1995; Hart and Ahuja, 1996; Klassen and Whybark, 1999; Majumdar and Marcus, 2001) and (product-driven) differentiation advantages (Hart, 1995). A long-term, sustainable advantage lies in the resource conﬁgurations that managers build using a PES (Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003; Christmann, 2000). Second, a PES is idiosyncratic (i.e., organization speciﬁc) due to its social complexity (Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003). For example, Majumdar and Marcus (2001) showed that when managers create a balance between regulatory policies and their dis- cretion, they can enjoy entrepreneurship, creativity, and risk taking; conduct R&D; and even develop new technologies, which are all important resources for a PES. Sharma (2000) found that the managerial interpretation of the environment either as an opportunity or a threat inﬂuences the extent to which a PES is deployed. To this end, Marcus and Geffen (1998, p. 1147) came to the conclusion that ‘‘key players are likely to interpret the conditions they face and assign meaning to the actions they take in fairly idiosyncratic ways.’’ Therefore, depending on the dominant coalition’s attitude and commitment to natural environmental issues, the adoption and implementation of a PES can be viewed as an opportunity to generate growth or as a threat and disruption to existing operations. Andersson and Bateman’s (2000) study shows that the success of employee-championing behaviors regarding natural environmental issues depends on their alignment with top management’s positive attention and actions to- ward these issues. Thus, we view top management’s support of natural environmental issues to be idio- syncratic and organization speciﬁc because manage- rial vision, leadership, and focus are distinctive and socially complex. stakeholder perspectives Third, a dynamic capability approach to a PES entails a complex integration and reconﬁguration of organizational, managerial, higher-order learning, and divergent (Aragon- Correa and Sharma, 2003). To this end, a PES is consistent with the dynamic capability perspective in that a PES involves an intricate integration of pollu- tion prevention, and managerial support and leader- ship. Sharma and Vredenburg (1998) have shown that competitively valuable organizational capabilities such as stakeholder integration, continuous innova- tion, and higher-order learning may emerge from the adoption of a PES. It necessitates Fourth, the application of a PES involves path dependency. the integration and combination of tacit capabilities that lead to causal ambiguity and barriers to imitation. The effective formulation and execution of a PES demands the alignment of the appropriate control mechanisms with incentives eliciting organizational structures so that all employees are motivated to participate actively in the delivery of the strategy (Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003). Externally driven perspective on a proactive environmental strategy In addition to the internally driven perspective, a PES needs to take into consideration externally driven (or legitimacy-based) activities under insti- tutional pressure because a purely internally driven approach may prove inadequate due to issues of external (social) legitimacy and reputation (Hart, Interactive Effect of Internal and External Factors on PES 283 regulation and consumer 1995). Suchman (1995, p. 574) deﬁnes legitimacy as ‘‘a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable.’’ Rao et al. (2008) argue that in emerging industries, new ventures face the vexing ‘‘liability of newness’’ problem because they have to prove to stakeholders that they are worthy investment opportunities. We contend that when there are institutional pressures such as gov- ernment sensitivity to environmental issues, a ﬁrm’s desire to enhance social ﬁtness is likely to provide the boundary condition for the effectiveness of economic ﬁtness. That is, insti- tutional theory suggests that when there is institu- tional pressure from various stakeholders, improving social legitimacy in the eyes of its stakeholders can moderate the degree to which ﬁrms adopt a PES based on internal antecedents (e.g., Oliver, 1991). In fact, Oliver (1991, p. 150) posits that responding to insti- tutional pressure ‘‘emphasizes the importance of obtaining legitimacy for purposes of demonstrating social worthiness.’’ A legitimacy-based view has its roots in neo- institutional theory (e.g., DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Oliver, 1991). Legitimacy theory is widely used as a framework to explain strategic choice with regard to the environmental and social behavior of organi- zations (Harvey and Schaefer, 2001; Hooghiemstra, 2000). Neo-institutional theorists (e.g., DiMaggio and Powell, 1983; Oliver, 1991) posit that since a competitive strategy may foster cooperative action in the interest of legitimacy, a competitive advantage must be created within the broader scope of social legitimacy. From a legitimacy theory per- spective, attention to the public’s perception of the ﬁrm and the reputation of the company will alter the internal perspective’s impact on a PES (Hooghiem- stra, 2000). As we outline subsequently, our predic- tion is that when there is greater social pressure from stakeholders such as the government and consumers, the inﬂuence of the internal perspective on a PES will be strengthened. social Because of the tacit nature of a pollution-pre- (legitimacy-based) vention capability, an external orientation should not competitive advantage, but rather reinforce and differentiate the ﬁrm’s position through the positive effect of a good reputation (Hart, 1995). Hence, a ﬁrm must also maintain legitimacy and build reputation through communication and transparency to invite external jeopardize stakeholders’ scrutiny into their operations (Hart, 1995; Suchman, 1995). Interaction between the two perspectives Based on the preceding literature review, we suggest that a model attempting to explain a PES should take a contingency view and capture how the externally driven perspective moderates the internally driven perspective’s effect on a PES. We outline the reasons for our approach below. First, while each perspective emphasizes a different aspect of a ﬁrm’s management of the business–natural environment interface, both aim to enhance the ﬁrm’s competitive advantage in the natural environ- mental arena. While one underscores the economic ﬁtness approach, the other emphasizes the social ﬁtness approach. As a consequence, the interplay between these two approaches can shed light on how a PES can be developed. Second, both perspectives are theory driven and have received attention from scholars in their respective ﬁelds of research. It is also important to note that both perspectives are designed to promote a better understanding of the inﬂuence of a PES on a ﬁrm’s performance. Indeed, they are not mutually exclusive paths for ﬁrms to follow. In summary, our review of the literature suggests that there is a shortage of studies that simultaneously model both the internal and external perspectives relating to a PES, and moreover, their interactive ef- fects. The lack of such a contingency approach in modeling a PES leads to at least two major problems that are of concern: First, most studies have subscribed to only one perspective of a PES and have used the same term to refer to different aspects of a ﬁrm’s behavior; this has produced results that are often dif- ﬁcult to compare and sometimes contradictory. Sec- ond, the richness of a PES is not exploited. Adopting only one perspective implies that the full range of options for a ﬁrm seeking to improve its performance may not be captured; this can lead to a partial expla- nation of a ﬁrm’s performance and to an incomplete theory. Third, reliance on a direct effects only model can obstruct the insights that a contingency model, by offering the boundary conditions of the impact of internally driven factors on a PES, can provide. In light of the limitations associated with the extant literature, it is important to develop a model 284 Bulent Menguc et al. external environment. More speciﬁcally, we consider institutional pressures from important stakeholders, such as consumers and government, which may possess valuable tangible and intangible resources. The effect of entrepreneurial orientation on proactive environmental strategy Firms are not likely to pursue a PES unless their upper echelons emphasize entrepreneurial activity (i.e., innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking) (Covin and Slevin, 1989, 1991). Top management’s recep- tivity regarding pollution prevention will increase when ﬁrms possess more of an entrepreneurial orientation. Aragon-Correa and Sharma (2003, p. 74) claim that ‘‘[p]roactive strategies such as pollution- prevention approaches need to be integrated into the administrative, entrepreneurial, and engineering dimensions of a ﬁrm.’’ Indeed ‘‘enviropreneurial marketing,’’ a term coined by Varadarajan (1992) that underscores incorporating an entrepreneurial spirit into the pursuit of an environ- mental marketing strategy, is consistent with a PES that promotes ecological sustainability (Menon and Menon, 1997). the importance of When there an entrepreneurial mindset embedded in the organization, top management is more willing to take risks, tolerate ambiguity and is that can incorporate both perspectives, and more importantly, demonstrate the interactive effect of the two on a PES. It is also essential to substantiate empirically the effect of a PES on ﬁrm’s perfor- mance. Our model, which we explain next, satisﬁes these requirements. Proposed model and hypotheses The theories that we draw onto construe our model, which is depicted in Figure 1, are the RBV of the ﬁrm and its derivatives (internal perspective), and institutional and legitimacy theories (external per- spective). The central tenet of the RBV of the ﬁrm and its derivations (i.e., NRBV and dynamic capa- bilities perspective) suggest that a ﬁrm’s PES and, in turn, the ﬁrm’s growth and competitive advantage is determined by its idiosyncratic internal resources and capabilities (e.g., Barney, 1991; Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Hart, 1995; Teece et al., 1997; Wernerfelt, 1984). In our model, we examine entrepreneurial orientation as an idiosyncratic capa- bility that is likely to explain the extent to which a ﬁrm adopts a PES. Legitimacy and institutional theories are useful in the development of our hypotheses because both are diagnostic with regard to how ﬁrms respond with strategic choices based on the demands of the macro External Perspective  Government regulations  Customer environmental  sensitivity  Internal Perspective  Entrepreneurial orientation  Proactive Environmental  Strategy  Firm Performance  Covariates Firm size  Type of industry  Environmental  dynamism  Figure 1.

Managers are more inclined to interpret new market spaces as oppor- tunities than threats (Dutton and Jackson, 1987; Sharma, 2000). In fact, drawing on the strategic issue interpretation literature, Sharma (2000) reports that the more managers interpret environmental issues as opportunities rather than threats, the more likely they are to adopt a PES. Such bold, aggressive, and proactive attitudes are likely to transfer into the adoption and implementation of more innovative and creative products and processes that are unique and difﬁcult to imitate (Russo and Fouts, 1997). Moreover, when there is a high entrepreneur- ial orientation, organizational capabilities, such as learning, continuous innovation, and experimenta- tion, are present, which lay the foundation for the adoption of a PES. Consistent with our argument, Aragon-Correa (1998) found that prospector-type ﬁrms that invest highly in entrepreneurship, engi- neering, and administration are more likely to adopt a PES. A PES entails considerable risk and uncertainty, and requires an innovative posture for it to be ﬁrmly established in an organization (Aragon-Correa, 1998; Aragon-Correa and Sharma, 2003). The proclivity of top management to support natural environmental issues is enhanced when an entrepreneurial orienta- tion is pervasive in the organization. As a conse- quence, an entrepreneurial orientation with its focus on seeking new ventures, growth, and market opportunities is consistent with the development of a PES. As a result, a ﬁrm’s entrepreneurial orientation is likely to promote a PES. Thus, we hypothesize the following: H1: A ﬁrm’s entrepreneurial orientation is related environmental proactive positively strategy. to a Moderating role of intensity of government regulation Institutional pressures are deﬁned as social, legal, and cultural forces outside the ﬁrm that exert inﬂuence on how managers perceive the environment and eventually shape and determine strategic decisions and behaviors (e.g., DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). In a natural environmental setting, many external forces may strengthen a ﬁrm’s desire to adopt a PES based on the ﬁrm’s entrepreneurial orientation (Bansal and Roth, 2000). We consider two components of institutional pressure: the intensity of government regulation and consumer sensitivity to environ- mental issues (e.g., Kassinis and Vafeas, 2006). The intensity of government regulation and consumer sensitivity to environmental issues may further motivate ﬁrms to take proactive steps toward the adoption of a PES from entrepreneurial orientation. According to stakeholder theory (Freeman, 1984), the strategic choices adopted by ﬁrms depend on institutional pressures and the inﬂuence of impor- tant stakeholders (Oliver, 1991). More speciﬁcally, Mitchell et al. (1997) showed that stakeholder power, legitimacy, and urgency affect a manager’s attitude toward stakeholder pressures and requests. This was conﬁrmed by Henriques and Sadorsky (1999) who afﬁrmed that managers in environmentally proactive ﬁrms were more committed to a proactive environ- mental posture than those in environmentally reactive ﬁrms. Neo-institutional theorists have proposed that ﬁrms, through proactive moves, may meet their stakeholders’ expectations and enhance legitimacy, thereby obtaining access to the scarce resources needed to survive and succeed (DiMaggio and Powell, 1983). For example, Majumdar and Marcus (2001) showed that when managers achieve a bal- ance between their discretion and governmental regulatory policies, they may enjoy entrepreneur- ship, be creative, conduct R & D, and even develop new technologies, all of which are important resources for the development of a PES. Our argument is also consistent with legitimacy theory because a central tenet of this theory is a social contract that implies that a company’s survival is dependent on the extent to which the company operates within the bounds and norms of the macro environment, including society, and is viewed as constructive and performing desirable actions (Brown and Deegan, 1998, p. 22). As a consequence, a company needs to demonstrate that its actions are legitimate and its behaviors resemble good corporate citizenship (e.g., Berman et al., 1999; Miles and Covin, 2000). Taking the above into account, we posit that there is a need to examine the interaction between the RBV perspective and institutional (legitimacy) 286 Bulent Menguc et al. theory. According to our conceptual framework, this would involve examining how institutional pressures such as intensity of government regulations moderate the inﬂuence of entrepreneurial orienta- tion on a PES. More speciﬁcally, we argue that the interaction effect between entrepreneurial orienta- tion and intensity of government regulation on a PES will be positive. This is because ﬁrms operate in a macro environment where governments control, sanction, and withhold important resources that are likely to inﬂuence a ﬁrm’s adoption of a PES. When ﬁrms compete in a market where government regarding involvement, environmental there is an elevated expectation for top management to comply, as this is the norm, with government demands. As a consequence, in such a context, the implementation of an entrepreneurial orientation will be related positively to the adoption of a pollution-prevention strategy by top management. Thus, we offer the following interaction hypothesis. interest, and regulations issues are heightened, H2: The interaction effect between entrepreneurial orientation and intensity of government reg- ulations will be related positively to a PES. Moderating role of consumer sensitivity to natural environmental issues Next, we turn our attention to the moderating role of consumer sensitivity to natural environmental is- sues. When consumers are sensitive to and involved with natural environmental issues, they favor and react positively to ﬁrms that attempt to develop and initiate innovative and proactive methods that pre- serve the natural environment (e.g., Garrett, 1987; Schwepker and Cornwell, 1991). As consumer sensitivity to natural environmental issues increase, consumers come to expect ﬁrms to develop inno- vative ways to interact with the natural environ- ment. As a consequence, in such a context, as ﬁrms engage in entrepreneurial activities, ﬁrms will realize more PES. When consumers exert pressure, ﬁrms are more prone to adopt a PES for a given level of entrepreneurial orientation because the adoption of a PES is consistent with the voice of consumers (Ogden and Watson, 1999). We posit that when there is ﬁt between entrepreneurial orientation and consumer sensitivity to natural environmental issues, it is likely that a ﬁrm’s entrepreneurial orientation will be related positively to a PES. Therefore, we hypothesize that: H3: The interaction effect between entrepreneurial orientation and customers’ sensitivity to envi- ronmental issues will be related positively to a PES. Proactive environmental strategy and ﬁrm’s performance Firms that implement a PES will be more innovative, entrepreneurially oriented, technologically sophis- ticated, and socially conscious, which makes such organizations distinct in the eyes of customers (Porter and van der Linde, 1995). Accordingly, these orga- nizations will be able to preempt the market from their competitors and enjoy a ﬁrst mover advantage status by sending a strong signal about their com- mitment to the natural environment. Because such ﬁrms invest in pollution prevention as opposed to control programs, they will engage in continuous total quality environment management programs that enable them to be more cost efﬁcient by minimizing the need to invest in expensive end-of-pipe capital intensive investments (Hart, 1995; Hart and Ahuja, 1996). In addition, because the implementation of a PES improves the image, reputation, and eventually the legitimacy of a ﬁrm, it will increase the positive view of the ﬁrm as a good corporate citizen (Menon and Menon, 1997). We contend that by imple- menting a PES, corporate citizenship will be en- hanced, which will lead to a stronger corporate reputation (Berman et al., 1999). In fact, Rondinelli and Berry (2000) argue that corporate environmental citizenship is critical for sustainable development. As a consequence, ﬁrms that pursue a PES will be perceived as differentiated in the eyes of customers. Through differentiation, ﬁrms with a PES will be able to create more opportunities, and hence generate greater business growth. A PES can be used to reig- nite, spark. or fuel ﬁrms into a new market space, thus providing the catalyst for sales and proﬁt growth. Owing to a growing environmental consciousness Interactive Effect of Internal and External Factors on PES 287 stakeholders from various such as and demands customers, interest groups, government, and the media, a PES can be expected to contribute to sales growth and proﬁt growth. Increased sales growth will be realized as environmentally friendly products are well received. That is, implementing a PES will generate additional sales in areas that are untapped and where competition is scarce. Further, a PES will motivate ﬁrms to produce high margin products adopting cutting-edge technology which can en- hance proﬁt growth. Through a PES, ﬁrms can realize improved streams of cash ﬂow as a PES will be able to function in a rent-generating role. Thus, we offer the following hypothesis regarding the performance im- pact of a PES: H4: A proactive environmental strategy will be positively related to (a) sales growth and (b) proﬁt growth. Finally, we do not hypothesize a direct effect on a PES from the external perspective (i.e., intensity of government regulation and consumer sensitivity to natural environmental issues) because according to our conceptual model, the external perspective is a moderator that either strengthens or weakens the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on a PES. However, as we shall show subsequently, we include the external perspective on a PES for model speci- ﬁcation purposes and report its effect. Research method Questionnaire development and measures (i.e., resource-based) and external As stated earlier, previous studies have employed the internal (i.e., legitimacy-based) perspectives to explain the extent of a ﬁrm’s implementation of PES. However, there is a lack of systematic research that investigates the interactive effect of the two perspectives. In order to ﬁll this gap in the literature, we decided to devise a survey instrument that would enable us to test the conceptual model developed in this study. More speciﬁcally, this survey instrument was meant to test how customers’ sensitivity to environmental issues and the intensity of government regulations mod- erate the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on a PES. The survey instrument also helped us measure the performance outcomes of a PES in terms of sales and proﬁt growths. The survey instrument was developed as follows: First, we contacted a random selection of 15 CEOs and/or key managers. We mailed a draft form of the survey questionnaire and asked them to identify the scale items they considered awkward and/or not applicable. They evaluated every scale item in terms of content and meaningfulness. Although we did not need to add new items, we modiﬁed some scale items based on the feedback we received. Second, we contacted four academics for their comments on the utility of the scale items. We made some revi- sions to the questionnaire as a result of their evalu- ations. It should be noted that the questionnaire was designed so that respondents were asked to recall their ﬁrms’ environmental processes and efforts in general. In doing so, we aimed to maximize po- tential variance and avoid perceptual biases (Table I). Unless otherwise mentioned, all scales were mea- sured with a ﬁve-point Likert scale (1 – strongly disagree, 5 – strongly agree). In line with our conceptualization, we measured proactive environmental strategy as a higher-order con- struct of two-ﬁrst-order dimensions: pollution pre- vention and top management support. In order to measure the scope of pollution prevention, we utilized the CERES Principles to develop a 10-item, ﬁve- point scale (1 – strongly disagree, 5 – strongly agree) speciﬁcally for this study. The CERES Principles (formerly known as the Valdez Principles) are a set of 10 environmental management principles developed in 1989 by a coalition of pension funds, environ- mental groups, and religious organizations (Codd- ington, 1993). Previous studies have employed the same or similar items to measure the scope of a PES (e.g., Sharma, 2000). Top management support mea- sured the extent to which top management was seen to play a critical role in shaping an organization’s values and orientation toward a PES. We developed a four-item, ﬁve-point scale for this study (1 – strongly disagree, 5 – strongly agree). Entrepreneurial orientation measured the extent to which the organization’s overall culture demon- strated a propensity to take calculated risks, to act in an innovative fashion, and to be proactive on natural environmental issues. Hence, we used an eight- item, ﬁve-point scale (1 – does not describe this 288 Bulent Menguc et al.

Institutional pressures were captured in terms of customers’ sensitivity to environmental issues and the intensity of government regulations. Customers’ environmental sensitivity measured customers’ sensi- tivity to a series of environmental actions. In order to capture this, we developed a nine-item, ﬁve-point scale (1 – customers do not care, 5 – customers are very concerned). The items used to measure the intensity of government regulations were similar to those used to measure customers’ environmental sensitiv- ity. We asked respondents to evaluate the extent to which government regulations force the organiza- tion to observe environmental standards (eight-item, ﬁve-point scale where 1 – not very intensely regu- lated, 5 – very intensely regulated). We measured ﬁrm’s performance in terms of the sales growth and proﬁt growth. Respondents were asked to indicate their ﬁrm’s sales growth (1: 0–9%; 2: 10–24%; 3: 25–49%; 4: 50–74%; 5: 75–100%; 6: 100% and over) and proﬁt growth (1: 0–9%; 2: 10–24%; 3: 25–49%; 4: 50–74%; 5: 75–100%; 6: 100% and over) during the 3 years prior to this study. In order to avoid model misspeciﬁcation, we in- cluded measures of ﬁrm’s type, and environmental dynamism to control for their effects on PES and ﬁrm’s performance. Environmental dynamism was measured by a four-item, bi-polar scale taken from Heide and John (1990). Firm’s size size, ﬁrm’s was measured by the number of full-time employees (i.e., natural logarithm). Firm’s type was a dummy variable (1 – predominantly business-to-business companies; 0 – others). Sample selection and data collection procedure We purchased a list of major New Zealand manu- facturing ﬁrms operating in a variety of industries from a leading market research/databank company (a total of 325 ﬁrms). Our focus on ﬁrms operating in multiple industries is designed to enhance the generalizability of our model and its ﬁndings. Con- sistent with Dillman’s (1978) Total Design Method, the ﬁrst mailing packet contained a personalized letter, a questionnaire, and a postage-paid envelope with an individually typed return-address label.1 In addition, we offered respondents a copy of the ﬁn- ished report, which summarizes the research ﬁnd- ings, to increase the response rate. Four weeks after the ﬁrst mailing, we sent a follow-up letter and an additional copy of the questionnaire to non- respondents. We obtained 150 usable questionnaires for a response rate of 47%. The distribution of the ﬁrms in terms of industry was as follows: Food, Beverage, and Tobacco (29%); Forestry and Wood Products (11%); Paper, Printing, and Publishing (11%); Textiles, Apparel, and Leather (10%); Agriculture (8%); Machinery (8%); Chemi- cals, Petroleum, and Plastics (7%). In addition, 69% of ﬁrms had more than 150 full-time employees and 290 Bulent Menguc et al. 75% were operating predominantly in the business- to-business domain. We tested for the likelihood of nonresponse bias by using the extrapolation technique that equates late responses to nonrespondents (Armstrong and Overton, 1977). We split the total sample into two groups: those received before the second wave of mailing and those received after the second wave. We used a t-test to compare these groups in terms of their mean responses for each variable. The results revealed no signiﬁcant differences between the two groups, thus leading us to conclude that respondents did not differ from nonrespondents. Our major goal regarding the data collection was to ensure that the key informants were either the CEO or a person who held an equal position in the company. One of the authors made a series of phone calls and conducted further mail surveys to conﬁrm that the questionnaires were completed by managers who were CEOs or held equal positions (Phillips, 1981). Analyses and results We present the data analysis in three steps: (1) measure validation, (2) a post-hoc test for common method bias, and (3) hypotheses testing. Measure validation As proposed by Anderson and Gerbing (1988), we estimated a (six-factor) measurement model. Con- ﬁrmatory factor analysis (CFA) reveals that all factor loadings are greater than 0.40, normalized residuals are less than 2.58, and modiﬁcation indices are less than 3.84. The measurement model also provides an acceptable ﬁt to the data: [v(887) = 1711.9; good- ness-of ﬁt index (GFI) = 0.93; Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) = 0.94; conﬁrmatory ﬁt index (CFI) = 0.95; root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.06]. The reliability estimates [Cronbach’s alpha, composite reliability, and average variance extracted (AVE)] for the different multi-item constructs are shown in Table I. 2 We found support for the presence of convergent validity in the scales; the factor loadings are signiﬁ- cant in the measurement model (t > 2.0; Anderson and Gerbing, 1988), and the AVE estimates are equal to or higher than 0.50 (Bagozzi and Yi, 1988). In support of discriminant validity, the squared corre- lations between any two constructs are less than the AVE estimates of the corresponding constructs for all pairs (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). We also assessed discriminant validity by comparing the uncon- strained model to the constrained model and setting the correlation between two constructs to one. For every pair of constructs, we found a signiﬁcant chi- square difference, which provides evidence of dis- criminant validity. itself indicated a good ﬁt As we stated earlier, we conceptualized PES as a higher-order factor of pollution prevention and top management support. We performed a second-order CFA for PES. We found that pollution prevention (loading = 0.87, R2 = 0.87) and top management support (loading = 0.76, R2 = 0.79) loaded signiﬁ- cantly on the higher-order construct of PES and the construct to the data 2 = 186.2, GFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.94, CFI = (v(76) 0.95, RMSEA = 0.06). The Cronbach’s alpha, com- posite reliability, and AVE for the higher-order construct of PES were 0.80, 0.81, and 0.63, respec- tively. These ﬁndings supported that PES could be operationalized as a higher-order construct of pollu- tion prevention and top management support. In further analyses, we averaged the scores of the respective sub-constructs (i.e., pollution prevention and top management support) to obtain the measure of PES. Table II provides the means, standard devi- ations, and intercorrelations of the study’s variables. Testing common method bias Owing to our reliance on self-reported data, we tested whether common method bias was a likely threat that could inﬂate the results of the hypotheses testing. First, we conducted Harman’s single factor test in CFA (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). The results indi- cated that a single-factor model did not ﬁt the data = 3539.8, GFI = 0.39, TLI = 0.38, well CFI = 0.41, RMSEA = 0.14). Second, the chi- square difference test also demonstrated a signiﬁcant difference between the single-factor model and the six-factor model the measurement model) (Dv2 = 1827.9, Ddf = 15, p < 0.001). The evidence from both tests indicates that the six-factor model is (v(902) 2 (i.e., Interactive Effect of Internal and External Factors on PES 291 TABLE II Descriptive statistics and intercorrelations Variables 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1.

Based on the results of this test and the discriminant test results previously discussed, we conclude that common method bias is unlikely to be a threat to our hypotheses testing. Results We tested our structural model by following the procedures recommended by Bollen (1989) and Hayduk (1987). We set the measurement path esti- mates at 1 and the error variance at the scale variance times 1 minus the reliability to account for mea- surement error. Since our model depicts interactions of entrepreneurial orientation with government regulations and customers’ sensitivity to environ- mental issues, we created interaction terms by mul- tiplying the mean-centered values of the respective variables so that the likely threat of multicollinearity is minimized (Aiken and West, 1991). The structural model provided a perfect ﬁt to 2 = 20.40; GFI = 0.98; TLI = 1.00; the data (v(21) CFI = 1.00; RMSEA = 0.01). The results of the structural model (Table III) indicate that entrepre- neurial orientation is related positively and signiﬁ- cantly to PES (b = 0.27; p < 0.001). Therefore, Hypothesis 1 is the interaction effect of entrepreneurial orientation and supported. We found that thus the intensity of government regulations was related positively and signiﬁcantly to PES (b = 0.25; p < 0.01), supporting Hypothesis 2. The interaction effect of entrepreneurial orientation and customers’ sensitivity to environmental issues was not related signiﬁcantly to PES (b = -0.02; ns); therefore, Hypothesis 3 was not supported. PES is related positively and signiﬁcantly to sales growth (b = 0.32; p < 0.01) and proﬁt growth (b = 0.31; p < 0.01). These ﬁndings support Hypotheses 4a and 4b. Turning to control variables, environmental dynamism is related negatively and signiﬁcantly to sales growth (b = -0.18; p < 0.05), and ﬁrm’s size is related positively and signiﬁcantly to both sales growth (b = 0.50; p < 0.01) and proﬁt growth (b = 0.58; p < 0.01). Post-hoc analyses We conducted three additional analyses. First, our model posits that entrepreneurial orientation, the intensity of government regulations, and customers’ sensitivity to environmental issues are drivers of a PES. It is plausible that there is reverse causality between a PES and its drivers. More explicitly, a PES may affect the extent of a ﬁrm’s entrepre- neurial orientation, the intensity of government 292 From Bulent Menguc et al.

We acknowledge that it is difﬁcult to rule out this alternative explanation with our cross-sectional re- search design. However, we perform a test of whether the model that posits entrepreneurial orientation, the intensity of government regulations, and customers’ sensitivity to environmental issues to predict a PES and, in turn, ﬁrm’s performance provides a better ﬁt to the data (and, therefore, explanatory power) than the alternative model (i.e., a PES predicting entre- preneurial orientation, the intensity of government regulations, and customers’ sensitivity to environ- mental issues and, in turn, ﬁrm’s performance). We conducted a model comparison, using the structural equation modeling technique. We compared the two models based on: (1) model ﬁt (i.e., larger values indicating better ﬁt or more explanatory power) and (2) Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) (i.e., smaller value indicating better ﬁt). 2 = 7.92; GFI = 0.98; TLI = 0.99; PNFI = 0.39, The results indicate the following: Model 1: v(6) CFI = 0.99; RMSEA = 0.07, AIC = 37.92 2 = 68.93; v(2) Model GFI = 0.89; TLI = 0.44; CFI = 0.80; RMSEA = 0.17, PNFI = 0.11; AIC = 106.93 2 (Alternative Model): The ﬁndings suggest that the model which posits the intensity of that entrepreneurial orientation, government regulations, and customers’ sensitivity to environmental issues predict a PES and, in turn, ﬁrm’s performance provides a better ﬁt to the data (and, therefore, explanatory power) than the alter- native model (i.e., a PES predicting entrepreneurial orientation, the intensity of government regulations, and customers’ sensitivity to environmental issues and, in turn, ﬁrm’s performance). Second, we tested to see whether entrepreneurial orientation actually plays a mediating role in the Interactive Effect of Internal and External Factors on PES 293 relationship between a PES and performance. Therefore, we followed the three-step procedure recommended by Baron and Kenny (1986). They suggest that the following conditions must be met to establish mediation. First (Step 1), the independent variable (i.e., PES) must be related signiﬁcantly to the mediator (i.e., entrepreneurial orientation). Second (Step 2), a PES must be related signiﬁcantly to the dependent variable (i.e., sales/proﬁt growth). Third (Step 3), the mediator must be related sig- niﬁcantly to the dependent variable (i.e., sales/proﬁt growth). If these conditions all hold in the predicted direction, then the effect of a PES on sales/proﬁt growth must be less in the third equation (when the mediator is included) than in the second (when the mediator is excluded). Full mediation holds if a PES has no effect when the mediator is controlled for (Baron and Kenny, 1986, p. 1177). The results indicate that a PES is related signiﬁcantly to entre- preneurial orientation (t = 3.81; p < 0.001) (Step 1) and a PES is related signiﬁcantly to sales growth (t = 2.83; p < 0.01) and proﬁt growth (t = 2.61; p < 0.01) (Step 2). However, entrepreneurial ori- entation is not related signiﬁcantly to sales growth (t = 0.18; ns) and proﬁt growth (t = -0.10; ns) (Step 3). Therefore, it is concluded that entrepre- neurial orientation does not play a mediating role in the relationship between a PES and performance. Third, given that entrepreneurial orientation is not related signiﬁcantly to performance, we tested to examine if the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on performance (sales/proﬁt growth) is intensiﬁed by the presence of a PES (as a moderating variable). The results indicate that the interaction term of PES and entrepreneurial orientation is related positively and signiﬁcantly to proﬁt growth (t = 2.05; p < 0.05) but not to sales growth (t = 1.94; ns). Therefore, we conclude that a PES plays a moderating role in the relationship between entrepreneurial orientation and proﬁt growth. We elaborate on these additional ﬁndings in the next section. Discussion This article draws on literatures from the RBV and its derivations (e.g., the NRBV and dynamic capa- bilities perspective), and from institutional and legitimacy theories to conceptualize and test an integrated model by examining the interaction be- tween the internally and externally driven perspec- tives on a PES. We also tested the long-debated and mixed ﬁndings in the literature regarding the rela- tionship between a PES and ﬁrm’s performance (e.g., sales and proﬁt growth). Although the internally and externally driven perspectives that explain a PES have developed in tandem, the approaches have been mainly inde- pendent and mutually exclusive. That is, these two perspectives on a PES, internal and external, have been researched in a parallel fashion without due attention given to the interplay between both views under a single model. As a consequence, rather than accommodating the two in a direct effects model, we explore a contingency model and argue that the intensity of government regulation and consumer sensitivity to natural environmental issues moderate the impact of entrepreneurial orientation on a PES. As a consequence, the contribution of this article lies in its investigation of the interactive effect between the internal and external perspectives on a PES. From a theoretical contribution perspective, our article examines the interplay between the RBV and institutional theory (and legitimacy theory) in shaping a PES. Next, we discuss some of the implications of our ﬁndings. We ﬁrst discuss the main effect of entre- preneurial orientation on a PES followed by how this is qualiﬁed by institutional pressures from the government and consumers. We conclude with the performance effect of a PES. We found that a ﬁrm’s entrepreneurial orientation positively affects the adoption of a PES. If a ﬁrm’s environmental strategy is merely reactive as opposed to proactive, an entrepreneurial orientation may not be needed. However, a PES demands that the ﬁrm be venturesome and audacious, take on risks, and be at the forefront of innovative products and processes. Aragon-Correa (1998) also found that strategy type or posture was related to a ﬁrm’s approach toward the natural environment in that prospectors were more likely to adopt a PES. Therefore, we can postulate that one of the reasons a higher entrepre- neurial orientation is more likely to lead to the adoption of a PES may lie in the common organi- zational culture, strategic posture, and structure that both require. From a RBV perspective, when a ﬁrm 294 Bulent Menguc et al. has more resources and the capability to be entre- preneurial, it is more likely to adopt a PES. Also, as shown from our post-hoc analysis, entrepreneurial orientation did not have a direct effect on ﬁrm’s performance nor did it mediate the relationship between a PES and ﬁrm’s performance. It was only under a PES that entrepreneurial orientation showed a positive effect on ﬁrm’s performance. This suggests that a PES complements the impact of entrepre- neurial orientation on ﬁrm’s performance by strengthening the relationship between the two. Although not part of our formal testing, future re- search could examine alternative model evaluations to assess whether a PES explains data better as a mediator or as a moderator between entrepreneurial orientation and ﬁrm’s performance. Now, with regard to the outcome of the inter- action hypotheses, interestingly, only intensity of government regulation and not consumer sensitivity to natural environmental issues moderated the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on a PES. As intensity of government regulation increased, the positive effect of entrepreneurial orientation on a PES be- came stronger. However, we did not ﬁnd that intensity of government regulation had a direct ef- fect on PES. Conversely, consumer sensitivity to natural environmental issues did not function as a moderator for the entrepreneurial orientation–PES relationship. However, we did ﬁnd that consumer sensitivity to natural environmental issues had a di- rect and positive impact on PES. The direct effect of consumer sensitivity to natural environmental issues on a PES is consistent with legitimacy theory and stakeholder theory in that customers are among the most important stake- holders who exert inﬂuence and pressure on how ﬁrms respond to natural environmental issues (e.g., Buysse and Verbeke, 2003). In today’s business environment, customers have the will and power to have a signiﬁcant effect on ﬁrm’s performance by curbing and altering purchase behavior, organizing boycotts, and taking legal action to rectify irre- sponsible ﬁrm’s behavior. From the ﬁrm’s perspec- tive, acting in a socially responsible manner can the ﬁrm, enhance the reputation and image of thereby strengthening the social its identity and existence in the eyes of customers. Therefore, when customer sensitivity to natural environmental issues increases, ﬁrms are more likely legitimacy of to adopt a PES that satisﬁes and resolves the concerns that customers have about natural environmental issues and strengthens ﬁrms’ social ﬁtness. The ab- sence of a moderating effect from consumer sensi- tivity to natural environmental issues suggests that the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on PES is not altered as consumer sensitivity changes. On the contrary, intensity of government regu- lation moderated the relationship between entre- preneurial orientation and a PES. This suggests that building a PES based on entrepreneurial orientation is effective when the intensity of government reg- ulation elevates. That is, ﬁrms that desire to adopt a PES should ﬁnd entrepreneurial orientation a useful means under high government regulation. Not- withstanding, intensity of government regulation did not have a direct positive effect on PES. Our results echo the ﬁndings of Henriques and Sadorsky (1999) who reported that not all stakeholders are equally important and that some carry more weight than others. That is, governments may be a secondary rather than primary stakeholder group in the New Zealand context. In fact, Buysse and Verbeke (2003) found that ﬁrms with a reactive environmental strategy attached signiﬁcant importance to stake- holders such as domestic regulators and local public agencies (although they also found that ﬁrms with a prevention strategy attached even more importance to such groups). One of the reasons for the null ﬁnding may reside in the nature of the New Zealand government’s regulation policy regarding natural environmental issues. Because New Zealand ﬁrms, on average, are very environmentally conscious, the vast majority of the ﬁrms in our data set may not need intense gov- ernment regulations to prompt a PES. Rather than relying on a bureaucratic institution such as the government to exert pressure, pressure may come from trade associations or social community groups instead. This suggests that in markets such as New Zealand where natural environmental issues have long been part of the strategic dialogue and are ﬁrmly embedded in the social fabric of the ﬁrm, the role of the watch dog that monitors and reports violations of irresponsible environmental behavior falls on the shoulders of stakeholders such as customers or even employees (Buysse and Verbeke, 2003). Our ﬁndings also point to the importance of the role of the environmental industry life cycle as a Interactive Effect of Internal and External Factors on PES 295 potential driver to a PES (e.g., Russo and Fouts, 1997). That is, in markets where the notion of a PES is well-established and accepted (i.e., in the maturity stage as opposed to the infancy or growth stage), the direct inﬂuence of the government may shrink and a shift in power and pressure to other stakeholders can occur. Conversely, in markets where the concept of a PES is still novel and not widely disseminated (i.e., an infancy or growth stage), the government is likely to play a bigger role in shaping and forming a PES. Our results are also consistent with the study of Mitchell et al. (1997) in that in the New Zealand context, a manager’s perception of the government’s saliency, which they deﬁned as the cumulative im- pact of power, legitimacy, and urgency, may be minimal; this explains the absence of a direct effect. Our ﬁndings also suggest that stakeholder impor- tance and saliency may be driven not only by managers’ attitudes, values, and time, but also by different cultural and social attitudes toward envi- ronmental issues (Agle et al., 1999). Another implication of this ﬁnding relates to the concept of stakeholder integration (Rueda-Manzan- ares et al., 2008). As Rueda-Manzanares et al. (2008, p. 189) posit, ‘‘stakeholder integration capability helps ﬁrms proactively detect evolving trends around preservation of the natural environment and engage stakeholders such as consumers, local communities and NGOs to generate knowledge about balancing customer utility, economic development, commu- nity welfare, ﬁnancial performance and ecological conservation.’’ It is noteworthy that two different stakeholders exert inﬂuence in very different ways: one as a moderator and the other as a direct effect. From a theoretical perspective, our ﬁndings sug- gest that when ﬁrms have resources and capabilities that are compatible and valued by the broader society as a whole, their contribution to strategy adoption will be enhanced and appreciated. That is, the RBV can be an effective theoretical lens by which strategy adoption can be explained when resources are not incompatible with the demand of external stakeholders (e.g., consumers and govern- ment) and are legitimate from an institutional and legitimacy theory perspective. Finally, our ﬁndings provide strong support for the returns on a PES in terms of (a) sales growth and (b) proﬁt growth. As the importance of environ- mental management continues to occupy a primary position on the agenda not only in business, but also in political dialogues, the positive return on a PES is promising as such ﬁndings provide greater motiva- tion and incentives for ﬁrms to embrace a PES and build their sustainable competitive advantage around this strategic posture. The adoption of a PES can be a catalyst for generating future growth opportunities and creating untapped market space. Our ﬁndings demonstrate the positive effect of a PES on ﬁrm’s performance; however, this may be due to how PES is perceived in the New Zealand market. More re- search will be needed to identify whether such outcomes are indeed the case in markets where PES is less developed and prevalent. Limitations and future research Although we received support for all but one of our hypotheses, our study is not without limitations. Our limitations also provide motivation for future research directions. First, Owing to the nature of cross- sectional data, it is not possible to discern causality among our constructs. For example, it is conceivable that more proﬁtable ﬁrms with slack resources may invest in a PES. Therefore, replicating and extending our study using longitudinal data should be useful in explicating the causal relationships between constructs. Second, in our model, we limited the externally driven institutional pressures to customer sensitivity and government regulation intensity. It would be worth- while to expand the stakeholder groups to include non-government organizations (NGOs), media, and industry/trade associations. Third, a promising re- search area that deserves more attention in the future is an examination of the process by which a PES has a positive effect on ﬁrm’s performance. Much study has been devoted to ﬁnding a positive return on a PES, but how this occurs is still not completely understood. Identifying the key mediating variables that form the bridge between a PES and ﬁrm’s performance could go a long way in furthering our knowledge of this rela- tionship. Along similar lines, clarifying when a PES will pay off in terms of growth and proﬁtability is an- other area that deserves more attention as the adoption of a PES may not be a wise strategic choice under certain conditions. Fourth, both Hart (1995) and Aragon-Correa and Sharma (2003) concede that a PES that entails a 296 Bulent Menguc et al. focus on pollution prevention demands a decen- tralized structure. Thus, this argument could be tested to see whether higher entrepreneurial orien- tation is also expected to shape the structure of an organization and if it is related negatively to cen- tralization, formalization, and departmentalization (Matsuno et al., 2002). Last but not least, previous researchers have articulated a typology of organizational culture in terms of four types: clan, adhocracy, hierarchy, and (Cameron and Quinn, 1999; Deshpande´ market et al., 1993). Future researchers may examine whe- ther a PES is likely to ﬂourish most in an adhocracy type of organizational culture where innovation, risk taking, adaptability, ﬂexibility, growth, new market space, and entrepreneurship are emphasized. Conclusion Our study contributes to the natural environment and corporate social responsibility literature by concep- tualizing and testing an integrated model of the antecedents and consequences of a PES. Our ﬁndings suggest that entrepreneurial orientation has a positive effect on a PES and that this effect is stronger as the intensity of government regulation increases. Con- sumer sensitivity did not have a moderating effect but had a direct effect. Furthermore, the performance effect of a PES is realized in terms of greater sales growth and proﬁt growth. In conclusion, under the right combination of internal and external drivers, a PES can beneﬁt sales and proﬁt growth, which, in turn, can contribute to improved ﬁrm’s performance.
