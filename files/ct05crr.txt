Corporate Reputation Review Volume 8 Number 1 Academic Research Perceived Organizational Reputation and Organizational Performance: An Empirical Investigation of Industrial Enterprises Abraham Carmeli Bar-Ilan University, Israel Asher Tishler Tel Aviv University, Israel ABSTRACT This study analyzes the complex set of rela- tionships among perceived organizational repu- quality of products/services, tation, ﬁrm’s customers’ satisfaction and multiple perfor- mance measures. A path analysis shows that reputation is inﬂuenced by customers’ satisfac- tion, which is a mediator in the relationship between the ﬁrm’s quality of products/services and reputation. Reputation is associated with the ﬁrm’s growth and accumulation of custo- mers’ orders, but is not directly associated with market ﬁnancial strength. Market share inﬂuences a ﬁrm’s prof- itability and is a function of the ﬁrm’s growth and accumulation of customers’ orders, but it on the ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial has no strength. proﬁtability inﬂuence share, and KEYWORDS: Perceived organizational repu- tation, organizational performance, customers’ satisfaction, quality of products/services INTRODUCTION Considerable research by scholars and prac- titioners has recently been devoted to iden- tifying the predictors and understanding the consequences of organizational reputa- tion. A prominent theoretical framework variance the heterogeneity of for assessing the importance of organiza- tional reputation is the resource-based view of the ﬁrm (RBV). According to the RBV framework, the resources of diﬀerent ﬁrms leads to diﬀer- ences in their competitive advantage and performance and Hamel, 1990; Reed and DeFillippi, 1990; Wernerfelt, 1984). Gaining and preserving a sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) depends on the unique bundle of core resources a ﬁrm has developed, acquired and deployed in the competition arena (Aaker, 1989; Amit and Schoemaker, 1993; Barney, 1991, 1995; Grant, 1991; Wernerfelt, 1984). (Prahalad that According to Fombrun (1996: 57) ‘cor- porate reputations are held by people inside and outside a company’. Firms consistently compete to be better-regarded companies; a status that reﬂects a competitive advan- tage and, possibly, superior performance (Fombrun, 1996). A favorable organiza- tional reputation is, by deﬁnition, a strate- gic the ﬁrm’s competitive position relative to its compe- titors. A ﬁrm with a favorable organiza- tional reputation has a competitive edge over its rivals that, according to Fombrun resource, reﬂects as it Corporate Reputation Review, Vol. 8, No. 1, 2005, pp. 13–30 # Henry Stewart Publications, 1363–3589 Page 13 Perceived Organizational Reputation and Organizational Performance Considerable and Shanley (1990: 223), ‘may enable ﬁrms to charge premium prices, attract better applicants, enhance their access to capital markets and attract investors’. eﬀorts have also been devoted to studying the relations between organizational reputation and the organiza- tion’s ﬁnancial performance and stock market value (Antunovich et al., 2000; Hammond and Slocum Jr., 1996; McGuire et al., 1988; McMillan and Joshi, 1997; Roberts and Dowling, 1997; Srivastava et al., 1997; Vergin and Qoronﬂeh, 1998). To date, most studies have concentrated on the relationship between organizational reputa- tion and the ﬁrm’s performance by sepa- rately analyzing the inﬂuence of each individual dimension of organizational reputation on the ﬁnancial and market per- formance of the organization. that the as describes the ﬁrm’s performance This study’s major goal is to extend the model relationship between perceived organizational reputa- tion and the ﬁrm’s performance by look- ing at a multidimensional measure. The authors use CEOs, beliefs and evaluation of their company’s reputation as proxies of the actual reputation of the ﬁrm (ie perceived organizational reputation).1 It would have been preferable to use objective data, but unfortunately they were not available for the companies in this study. Speciﬁcally, this study aims to show that the organiza- tion’s reputation aﬀects the organization’s ﬁnancial performance and its market per- formance diﬀerently. Furthermore, is also suggested here that the quality of products/services and customer satisfaction have diﬀerent eﬀects on organizational reputation. Thus, instead of looking for a direct and positive correlation between quality of products/services and customer satisfaction and organizational reputation, the authors suggest looking for a mediated relationship, relationship between the quality of products/services in which the it Page 14 success and organizational reputation is mediated by customer satisfaction. This mediation was suggested by Lipovetsky et al. (1997), who found that beneﬁts to the customer (ie the extent to which the customer is satisﬁed with the product characteristics) was, by far, the most signiﬁcant dimen- sion of in technological projects undertaken by Israeli defense ﬁrms. This study enhances the understanding of the relations between perceived organizational reputation and multiple-performance mea- sures of the ﬁrm. It also clariﬁes the rela- tions between the quality of products/ services, customer satisfaction and the per- ceived organizational the ﬁrm. reputation of and perceived This study emphasizes two major ﬁnd- ings. First, high quality of products is not directly associated with overall perceived organizational reputation. Rather, the rela- tionship between quality of products/ser- vices organizational reputation is mediated by customer satis- faction. Secondly, the empirical ﬁndings of this study suggest that the eﬀect of per- ceived organizational reputation on the ﬁrm’s proﬁtability and ﬁnancial strength is not direct. Hence, top management should not perceive the ﬁrm’s growth as the ulti- mate and only goal. Rather, both the ﬁrm’s growth and its market share serve as mediating variables in gaining high proﬁt- ability. This paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the theoretical back- ground of organizational reputation as a strategic resource that yields a sustainable competitive advantage and leads to a super- ior performance by the organization. The conceptual model and hypotheses are then presented. The research method — partici- pants, measures and data analysis — is fol- lowed by the results of the study. Finally, there is a discussion, which lists the limita- tions of this research and suggests areas for future research. THE THEORETICAL BACKGROUND in (Prahalad performance The Resource-based View of the Firm Organizational reputation is of increasing interest to researchers and practitioners in resource-based strategic management. The RBV suggests that ﬁrms should be ana- lyzed in terms of their resources, not only in terms of their product market activities (Wernerfelt, 1984). A basic premise is that ﬁrms are not alike. Diﬀerent ﬁrms are expected to possess diﬀerent proﬁles of resources (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993; Peteraf, 1993) and this heterogeneity of organizational resources — both tangible and intangible — accounts for diﬀerences in ﬁrms’ competitive advantage and varia- bility and Hamel, 1990; Reed and DeFillippi, 1990). Resources are considered strategic or core if they diﬀerentiate a ﬁrm strategically (Leonard-Barton, 1992). The fundamental insight of the RBV is in steering research- ers toward ﬁrm-speciﬁc resources as the real competitive advantage and above-normal performance of the ﬁrm (Ghemawat and Pisano, 2000; Penrose, 1959; Reed and DeFillippi, 1990; Rumelt, 1984; Teece et al., 1997; Werner- felt, 1984). Thus, when using the term resource it means a strategic resource, one that creates a competitive advantage. Competi- tive advantage is generated only when a ﬁrm is implementing a value-creating strat- egy that is not simultaneously being imple- mented by any current or potential competitors and when these other ﬁrms are unable to duplicate the beneﬁts of this strategy (Barney, 1991: 102). Collis and Montgomery have encapsulated the ratio- nale behind the RBV, whereby resources are ‘the substance of the very essence of sustainable competitive advan- tage’ (1998: 27). Intangible resources are very important for achieving a competitive advantage (eg Ambrosini and Bowman, 2001) because they are valuable, rare, diﬃ- source of sustainable strategy, Carmeli and Tishler cult or costly to imitate, substitute and trans- (Barney, 1991, 1997; Dierickx and fer Cool, 1989; Reed and DeFillippi, 1990; Peteraf, 1993). Organizational Reputation — Deﬁnition Organizational reputation is a construct that is not easy to deﬁne (eg Dowling, 1988). The inherent diﬃculty in ﬁnding a sole explicit deﬁnition for this construct results from the wide range of facets it embodies. The concept reputation is used by several diﬀerent disciplines, each of which deﬁnes it diﬀerently (Deephouse, 2000: 1093). Furthermore, reputation is deter- mined according to the observer’s percep- tions and Montgomery, 1998: 65). Researchers per- ceive reputation as a ‘fragile resource’ (Hall, 1993: 616), which changes over time (Ching et al., 1992: 291), yet enjoys relative stability (Barney, 1997: 226), reﬂects cumu- lative investments (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990: 254) and exists as a concept distinct from other organizational behavior con- structs (Jones, 1996: 286). interpretations (Clark and environments — where Reputation reﬂects the ﬁrm’s structure and a large variety of its activities. Olins (1990) related reputation and an organiza- tion’s identity arguing that they include everything the organization does regarding four major areas of its activity: ﬁrst, pro- ducts/services — what it makes or sells; secondly, (in which physical place) it makes or sells its products/services; thirdly, information — how it describes and publicizes its activities; and fourthly, behavior — how the mem- bers of the organization behave to each other and to non-members. Fombrun (1996: 72) suggests that corporate reputa- tion consists of four interrelated character- istics: credibility, reliability, responsibility and trustworthiness. Elsbach and Glynn (1996) three types of reputation that ﬁrms attempt to cultivate: toughness, high quality and distinction. Shrum and suggest Page 15 Perceived Organizational Reputation and Organizational Performance to Vergin for this argument Wuthnow (1988) claim that reputational status is not simply a function of market position, but is more complex insofar as it is a function of past performance, the struc- ture and the network position of the orga- nization. According and Qoronﬂeh (1998: 22), reputation reﬂects everyday behavior as exhibited through numerous small decisions. Empirical sup- port is provided by Yoon et al. (1993), who found that a pur- chaser’s response to a service was consistent with their attitude toward the reputation of (1999: 63) extended this view, claiming that reputa- tional capital is the initial part of social capital that solidiﬁes credibility, reliability, responsibility, trustworthiness and account- ability. Deephouse (2000: 1097) refers to media reputation, which is the ‘overall eva- luation of a ﬁrm presented in the media’. Wartick (1992: 34) referred to corporate reputation as ‘the aggregation of a single stakeholder’s perceptions of how well organizational responses are meeting the demands and expectations of many organi- zational stakeholders’. the vendor. Petrick et al. The Strategic Role of Organizational Reputation A critical question is to what extent orga- nizational reputation is considered to be a strategic resource of the ﬁrm. Having a favorable organizational reputation means that the ﬁrm’s constituencies perceive the ﬁrm as more attractive than other ﬁrms. The decision of to enter into a contract with a ﬁrm is based, among other considerations, on its reputa- tion 1998; Fombrun, 1996; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Weigelt 1988). According to Fombrun (1996), when one enters into a contract with a supplier of a product or service (eg travel agent, con- tractor, lawyer, accountant etc), it is most likely that the decision to choose one these constituencies and Montgomery, and Camerer, (Clark Page 16 supplier over the others is based on infor- mation including recommendations regard- ing each supplier’s reputation. Thus the choice is based, at least to some extent, upon the reputation — favorable or unfa- vorable — of those suppliers. This point is also emphasized by Dollinger et al. (1997), who note that a ﬁrm’s reputation is an important criterion in it being targeted for a joint venture. Podolny (1993) argued that a favorable status in the market enables a ﬁrm to access critical resources. Stuart et al. (1999) found that the ability of young biotech ﬁrms to acquire critical resources for survival and growth depends on the prestige of their aﬃliates (eg alliance part- that ners, established highly regarded equity partners were more likely to have prominent alliance partners and to use prestigious investment banks. investment banks etc). Firms relationships with Organizational reputation is an intangi- ble resource, representing an overall assess- ment of the ﬁrm’s current assets, position and expected future performance (Teece et al., 1997: 521). As a core resource, organi- zational reputation could be a major factor in gaining a competitive advantage and fortifying the organization’s ﬁnancial posi- tion because it is diﬃcult for competitors to match the prestige and esteem created by reputation (Hall, 1992: 138). According to Shrum and Wuthnow (1988: 909), ‘reputational critical resource for organizational managers’ and represents the outcome of a competitive process their key characteristics to constituents in order to maximize their economic and non-eco- nomic (social) status (Fombrun and Shan- ley, 1990: 234). Based on Fombrun (1996) and Fombrun and Shanley (1990), a favor- able organizational reputation may gener- ate several competitive advantages for a ﬁrm, including (1) delaying rivals’ mobility in the industry, (2) charging premium (see also Benjamin and Podolny, prices in which ﬁrms status becomes a signal (5) building a 1999), (3) attracting better applicants as well as investors, (4) enhancing its access to capital markets, strong morale among employees and (6) improv- ing both economic and non-economic results. As suggested by Podolny and Feld- man (1997: 10), status is most valuable in those markets in which consumers ﬁnd it diﬃcult to observe the true quality of the goods or services and when producers are certain as to which resource allocation deci- sions will result in outputs that are highly valued by customers. (1997) During the and support Joshi to Hall’s ﬁndings the relationship 1990s, between organizational reputation and ﬁnancial and market performance received substantial attention by researchers. Hall (1992, 1993) demonstrated that CEOs of British ﬁrms identiﬁed company reputation as the most important intangible resource (among 13 resources) for the ﬁrm’s success. provided McMillan further that intangible resources (including reputation) lead to SCA. Roberts and Dowling (1997: 75) found that ‘corporate reputation is an extremely important strategic asset’ and ‘superior performers with favorable reputa- tion are able to sustain superior outcomes for longer periods of time’. Srivastava et al. (1997) showed that corporate reputation aﬀects the ﬁrm’s value by inﬂuencing how investors perceive the ﬁrm’s risk. McGuire et al. (1988) demonstrated that accounting- based measures, particularly return on assets (ROA), proved to be signiﬁcant pre- dictors of a ﬁrm’s reputation for social responsibility. Hammond Slocum (1996) found that two ﬁnancial factors — the standard deviation of the market rate of return of the ﬁrm’s stock and return on sales — provided a good explanation of the ﬁrm’s reputation. Fombrun and Shanley (1990) found that a ﬁrm’s reputation is highly associated with its proﬁtability and Russo and Fouts (1997) showed a positive relationship between environmental reputa- and tion and ROA. Antunovich et al. (2000) found that the most-admired ﬁrms, accord- ing to the Fortune Magazine survey, out- perform (on average) the market, while the least-admired ﬁrms under-perform within it. explores Although the relationship between cor- porate reputation and the ﬁrm’s market and ﬁnancial performance is supported by most studies, there is no agreement on the precise ﬁnancial measures that are asso- ciated with corporate reputation. Thus, this interrelationship paper the between organizational reputation and multiple performance measures. By doing that, it may be able to provide a better understanding of the inﬂuence of organiza- tional reputation on ﬁnancial and market performance. Moreover, this paper may be able to enrich the model by exploring the interrelationship between the quality of the ﬁrm’s products/services, customers’ satisfac- tion and organizational reputation. satisfaction THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL AND HYPOTHESES The conceptual model utilized here is pre- sented in Figure 1. Several studies have addressed the interrelationship between the quality of products/services (QP/S), custo- mers’ organizational reputation and market and ﬁnancial perfor- mance. Yet, to the authors’ knowledge, studies have not explored the previous entire interrelationship as depicted in Figure 1. This model suggests examining the relationship between QP/S and CS and their inﬂuence on organizational reputa- tion. than exploring the relationship of organizational reputation with performance dimensions (market or ﬁnancial), beneﬁt may be gained from using a multivariate analysis that examines the intercorrelations among several performance measures (Dvir et al., 1998). The rationale of using this approach is the premise that organizational It also suggests separate rather (CS), that Carmeli and Tishler Page 17 Perceived Organizational Reputation and Organizational Performance Figure 1: The conceptual model   Customers’  satisfaction  Quality of  products/ services Organizational  reputation    Firm’s growth Accumulation Market    share   Firm’s  profitability     Financial  strength  of  customers’  order (goods)    reputation might be diﬀerently correlated to some measures of a ﬁrm’s performance (eg market performance and ﬁnancial per- formance). the players in high-quality ﬁrms, Quality of Products/Services, Customers’ Satisfaction and Organizational Reputation A ﬁrm has a good reputation if consumers believe its products to be of high quality (Shapiro, 1983). Thus, high-quality ﬁrms are often high-reputation ﬁrms, or blue-chip companies (Antunovich et al., 2000). Most in the market prefer to of invest since this investment is considered ‘safe’, yielding above-normal returns. Scholars disagree about the merit of this approach. While Lakonishok et al. (1994) provide evidence that blue-chip companies, Antunovich et al. (2000) pro- vide strong support for this preference, showing that the most admired ﬁrms earned above-normal market performance. This the need to controversy raises opposes the preference investigate the relationship between QP/S and organizational reputation, rather than assigning a direct relationship between a ﬁrm’s QP/S and performance. Corporate reputation is determined by the core images or perceptions of the com- pany that are held by multiple constituen- cies. Underlying those perceptions is the impression made by the quality of the ﬁrm’s products and services. General Elec- tric (GE) sustained its ongoing favorable reputation’s status by using a particular image of QP/S: ‘We bring good things to life’. The QP/S is at the core of GE’s repu- tation. Recently, Garud and Lampel (1997) showed that improper product announce- ment ultimately would harm a company’s reputation deeply. This ﬁnding suggests that a ﬁrm’s QP/S should meet the expec- tations of the customers, thus increasing satisfaction with its products and services. Johnson & Johnson’s credo, written in 1943 by its chairman Robert Wood Johnson, is a good example. It states, ‘We believe our ﬁrst responsibility is to the doctors, nurses Page 18 Carmeli and Tishler (doctors, nurses, etc) and patients, to mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services. In meeting their needs, everything we do must be of high quality’ (Alsop, 1999). Johnson & Johnson’s credo suggests that the quality of the products and/or services alone is not suﬃcient for meeting custo- mers’ satisfaction. Another example is Check Point Software Technologies, an Israeli-based network security company, which has become the top internet security provider, with some 52 per cent of the world’s virtual private networks (VPN) market, as of July 2000. In its ﬁrst days, one of the company’s foun- ders, Gil Shwed, directed eﬀorts toward gaining a reputation as a government and military software provider, this ensured quality approval for the company’s products from a highly valued customer, the Israel Defense Force (IDF). Today, Check Point’s success is attributed not only to the reliability, credibility and trust- worthiness of its products, but mostly for to save its ability to enable customers ‘easily US$60,000 a month’ (Pruzman, 2001). In line with these arguments, the following hypotheses are proposed: since H1a: A ﬁrm’s quality of products/services is positively related to organizational reputation. H1b: A ﬁrm’s quality of products/services is positively related to customers’ satis- faction. H1c: Customers’ satisfaction is positively related to organizational reputation. a reputation. The present model suggests that organizational reputation has a direct inﬂuence only on two performance mea- sures — the ﬁrm’s growth and accumula- tion of customers’ orders (ACO) (clearly, proﬁtability depends on, in addition to ACO and the ﬁrm’s growth, the produc- tion cost and eﬃciency of the ﬁrm). Firms with a favorable organizational reputation have the ability to enhance their ACO and turnover. Penrose (1959) claimed that the ﬁrm’s growth is dependent on its resources and Itami with Roehl (1987) emphasized the importance of intangible (invisible) resources. Yoon et al. (1993) showed that intentions of customers to buy an insurance program depend on the reputation of the insurance company. Shapiro (1983) argued that favorable product-quality-based reputation enables a ﬁrm to require a pre- mium, which eventually provides a ﬂow of proﬁts that compensates the seller for the resources expended in building up the reputation. Although a ﬁrm’s reputation does not necessarily constitute a barrier to entry, but is more likely a cost of entry (Shapiro, 1983), the ﬁrm not only to maintain its customers, but also to recruit new ones, which enhances the ﬁrm’s turnover. As building up and main- taining a good reputation takes time and resources, however, it is unreasonable to expect that the premium the ﬁrm demands from its customers will compensate for the investment in the short term. Thus, it can be expected that the growth in ACO and revenues will only eventually be trans- formed into proﬁts. it enables Organizational Reputation and Multiple Performance The right side of the model depicted in Figure 1 indicates that rather than explor- ing the inﬂuence of organizational reputa- tion with an independent measure of performance, it is better to analyze multi- attribute measures of performance and how they are inﬂuenced by organizational ACO and the ﬁrm’s growth (eg growth in sales) may aﬀect other performance mea- sures. The authors expect that the ﬁrm’s growth would enhance its market share and proﬁtability, which, in turn, aﬀects the ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial strength. It is also expected that ACO will be associated with market share, but not necessarily with the ﬁrm’s proﬁtability. The rationale behind these Page 19 Perceived Organizational Reputation and Organizational Performance if relationships is that the ﬁrm’s growth is not an assurance of ﬁnancial strength. Rather, it enables the ﬁrm to recruit and maintain customers and position it as a dominant actor in the market. Eventually, the ﬁrm’s production and distribution are eﬃ- cient, it will be transformed into proﬁts. The collapse of many internet-based ﬁrms during 2000–01 resulted from a mistaken strategy of setting growth in revenues and market share as the ﬁrms’ objectives rather than long-term proﬁtability and ﬁnancial strength. In accordance with these argu- ments, the following hypotheses are pro- posed: H2a: Organizational reputation is posi- tively related to the ﬁrm’s growth. H2b: Organizational reputation is posi- tively related to the accumulation of customers’ orders (ACO). H2c: ACO is positively related to the ﬁrm’s growth. H2d: ACO is positively related to market share. H2e: The ﬁrm’s growth related to market share. H2f: The ﬁrm’s growth is is positively positively related to the ﬁrm’s proﬁtability. H2g: Market share is positively related to the ﬁrm’s proﬁtability. H2h: Market share is positively related to the ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial strength. H2i: The ﬁrm’s proﬁtability is positively related to its ﬁnancial strength. THE DATA AND THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY Participants and Data Collection The data used in this study were taken from a comprehensive research project that evaluated competencies (organizational communication, organiza- tional culture, internal control and others) of Kibbutz-owned industrial enterprises. organizational The sample of the study was drawn Page 20 from a population of 300 Kibbutz-owned industrial enterprises in Israel. A Kibbutz is a collective settlement that is based on agri- culture and industry (Segev, 1987). The importance of the Kibbutz industry to Israeli industry is demonstrated in the oﬃ- cial website of the Kibbutz Industries Asso- ciation (KIA): industries’ share in Israel’s industry amounts to 7 per cent of sales; 9 per cent of exports; 7 per investment and 6.5 per cent of cent of industrial (www.kia.co.il/ fabout.htm, 2001). ‘the Kibbutz employment’ Information regarding enterprises. The the Kibbutz industrial enterprises was drawn from a list of all the Kibbutz enterprises, as published by the KIA (KIA, 1999). The list includes 385 industrial authors deleted from the sample the very small enterprises and sub-units of larger busi- included industrial nesses. The enterprises industries from the old economy (eg agriculture, food, textile, steel and plastics) and the new econ- omy (eg biotechnology, electronics and pharmaceuticals) and is a good representa- tion of Israel’s industry. from a variety of sample A questionnaire to the enterprise’s CEO was mailed from and returned to a univer- sity address, using a self-addressed reply envelope. In order to encourage the partici- pants to take part in this study, two com- mitments were made. First, a cover letter guaranteed the complete anonymity of the respondents. Secondly, the authors pro- mised to deliver the results and conclusions of this study to all participants. Two mail- ing waves were conducted in order to obtain a high response rate. In total 95 questionnaires were returned, yielding a response rate of approximately 32 per cent (this response rate is similar to previous studies of the same research population (Segev, 1987)). Due to missing data, only 86 questionnaires were usable for this study. About 20 per cent of the enterprises belonged to the high-tech sector. The aver- age age of the enterprises was 27.7 years (standard deviation (s.d.) 15.2). The sam- ple’s average number of employees was 94 and the average annual turnover was about US$15m. The average age of the CEOs of the enterprises was 49 years (s.d. 7) and their mean tenure in the organization was 5.5 years (s.d. 4.4). All but one of the respondents were men. The majority of the CEOs (87 per cent) held at least a BA-level degree. The other 13 per cent had 14 or less years of education. Measures The study analyzed the relations between measures of quality of products/services, customers’ satisfaction, perceived organiza- tional reputation and performance mea- in the sures of sample. These measures are described below. the industrial enterprises and accumulation of Firm performance Five measures of the performance of each ﬁrm were included in this study: growth, strength, market proﬁtability, ﬁnancial share customers’ future orders (deﬁnitions are given below). The participants were asked to rate their ﬁrm’s performance relative to its competi- tors. Each measure was assessed on a ﬁve- point scale (ranging from 1 = much less than the competitors, 2 = less than the competitors, 3 = as good as the competi- tors, 4 = better than the competitors, to 5 = much better than the competitors). Firm’s growth was measured by the rate of growth in the ﬁrm’s revenues relative to last year. The proﬁtability measure included two items: proﬁt margin (the ratio between annual proﬁts before taxes and annual revenues) and return on equity (ROE: the ratio between proﬁts after taxes and total stockholders’ equity). The Cron- bach alpha reliability coeﬃcient of this measure was 0.86. Financial strength is deﬁned as the extent to which a ﬁrm is able to cover its current liabilities with assets that can be converted quickly into cash. Speciﬁcally, this measure equaled the ratio between the ﬁrm’s current assets and its current liabilities. Market share gain was deﬁned as the enterprise’s estimate of last year’s change in its market share. Finally, the accumulation of change in the customers’ orders during the last year.2 customers’ orders was innovativeness; Perceived organizational reputation This measure was based on Fortune Maga- zine’s ‘Annual Survey of America’s Most Admired Corporations’. This survey is conducted among 8,000 top executives, outside directors and ﬁnancial analysts, who are asked to rate the ten largest com- panies in their own industry on eight attri- butes, using a scale of 0 (poor) to 10 (excellent). The attributes are quality of management; quality of products or ser- vices;3 long-term invest- ment value; ﬁnancial soundness; ability to attract, develop and retain talented people; community and environmental responsibil- ity; and use of corporate assets (eg Smith, 1990). This index has been used in numer- ous studies, eg Fombrun and Shanley (1990); Fryxell and Wang (1994); Gate- wood et al. (1993) and McGuire et al. (1988). Some studies have used this index of reputation to evaluate overall corporate reputation (eg Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Fryxell and Wang, 1994), while others used only its components, mainly corporate social responsibility (eg Ham- mond and Slocum, 1996; McGuire et al., 1988). Fortune Magazine’s ‘Corporate Reputa- tion Index’ often has been criticized. It has been argued that (1) from the start, the index was not scientiﬁc research (eg Deephouse, 2000); the (2) survey is limited to certain constituencies without taking into consideration other sta- keholders’ opinions (eg Fombrun, 1996; intended for Carmeli and Tishler Page 21 Perceived Organizational Reputation and Organizational Performance studies Fryxell and Wang, 1994; Wood, 1995); (3) the survey is limited to a certain population (ie large US corporations) and has not been extended to other business populations. Nevertheless, this index is well regarded in the literature. Here the overall index was used, rather than a subset of its components, since previous (eg Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Fryxell and Wang, 1994) have found using factor analysis that all eight components of the index were loaded on a single factor. A test of a one-factor model, applied to this study’s overall cor- porate reputation index, yielded a good ﬁt; both the comparative ﬁt index (CFI) and the incremental ﬁt index (IFI) obtained a value of 0.98. The participants were asked to indicate to what extent they agreed or disagreed with each one of the eight com- ponents of the index. The components were assessed on a seven-point scale, ran- ging from 1 = ‘Strongly disagree’ to 7 = ‘Strongly agree’. The reliability of the measure used in this study was 0.77. Customers’ satisfaction This measure assessed the extent to which the ﬁrm fulﬁlled the customers’ need, in relation to its competitors (eg Collis and Montgomery, 1998). The respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which their customers were satisﬁed with the ﬁrm.

Fol- lowing Bentler and Bonnet (1980), Joreskog and Sorbom (1993) and Kline (1998), the indices relied upon here included the w2 sta- tistic divided by the degree of freedom (w2/ df) (recommended to be less than three). Joreskog and Sorbom (1993) pointed out that even if all the assumptions underlying the use of the w2 test hold, it might not be realistic to assume that the model holds exactly in the population. Thus, it is useful to also consider other, less sensitive, tests. These include the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) (its value is recommended to be up to 0.05 and is accep- table up to 0.08), index (RFI), the normed ﬁt index (NFI) and the comparative ﬁt index (CFI), which is recommended to be >0.90 and close to a value of 1.00. In addition, the parsimony normed ﬁt index (PNFI) (James et al., 1982) (the closer the value of the PNFI to 1.00, the more eﬃcient the model) and the expected cross-validation index (ECVI) were used. the relative ﬁt RESULTS Descriptive Statistics The means, standard deviations, reliabilities and the simple correlations among the research variables are presented in Table 1.

Path Analysis Table 2 shows the results of a path analysis among the model’s variables and the rele- vant test statistics. The estimates highlight several interesting ﬁndings. The research model, depicted in Figure 1, was almost fully supported by the data (see Figure 2). Contrary to H1a, no signiﬁcant path was found between quality of products/services and organizational reputation. H2h, which predicted that market share will be posi- tively related to ﬁnancial strength, was not supported either. Signiﬁcant relationships were found among all the other proposed paths and all the other hypotheses of the model were supported by the data. The ﬁndings suggest that there is no direct rela- tionship between the quality of products/ services reputation. Rather, these two variables are connected (mediated) via the variable customers’ satis- faction. The path between the variables quality of products/services and customers’ satisfaction was signiﬁcant (0.50), suggest- ing that positive customers’ satisfaction is and organizational required to gain a favorable organizational reputation and customer satisfaction is obtained if the ﬁrm’s quality of products/ services is high. Generally, the results in Table 2 show that a ﬁrm with high performance has a favorable organizational reputation. The relationship between organizational reputa- tion and performance, however, is indirect. The estimates in Figure 2 and Table 2 point to signiﬁcant paths between organi- zational reputation and the ﬁrm’s growth (0.405) and between organizational reputa- tion and the accumulation of customers’ orders (0.278). There were also signiﬁcant connections (paths) between the accumula- tion of customers’ orders and the ﬁrm’s growth (0.464) and between the accumula- tion of customers’ orders and market share (0.334). As expected, the ﬁrm’s growth was signiﬁcantly connected to market share (0.353) and to the ﬁrm’s proﬁtability (0.318). Market share was connected with the ﬁrm’s proﬁtability (0.278), but did not directly inﬂuence ﬁnancial strength (corre- lation of 0.084, see Table 2). Market share signiﬁcantly aﬀected the ﬁrm’s proﬁtabil- ity, which, aﬀected ﬁnancial strength (0.278). in turn, 0.519*** 1.00 Page 23 Perceived Organizational Reputation and Organizational Performance Table 2: Structural Coeﬃcients for the Research Model Path coeﬃcients Research model Quality of products/services ?

DISCUSSION Implications The goal of this study was to highlight the strategic role that perceived organizational reputation plays in creating superior per- formance among industrial enterprises. As pointed out by Petrick et al. (1999: 60), ‘reputation, whether or not it is embodied in a trademark, should receive constant lea- dership attention’. Strategists and econo- mists have devoted considerable eﬀorts to detecting the strategic role of organiza- tional reputation in creating SCA that, in turn, leads to superior performance. The logic behind attributing a strategic role to organizational reputation is the acknowl- edgment among academics and practi- tioners that having a good reputation is the outcome of a competitive process in which ﬁrms signal their key characteristics to their constituents and stakeholders in order to maximize their economic and non-eco- nomic position (Shrum and Wuthnow, 1988; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). Much less attention has been devoted, however, to the interrelationship between reputation that is based on quality of products/service, reputation that is based on customers’ satis- faction, overall organizational reputation and multivariate measures of performance. This study’s major goal was to bridge this gap by presenting and empirically testing a conceptual model that ties up all of these relationships. The ﬁndings of this study support the premise that organizational reputation has a strategic role in the ﬁrm’s attempt to obtain a competitive edge in the market. The ﬁndings here suggest some interesting theoretical and managerial implications. It has long been proposed that quality of pro- ducts/service-based reputation is associated with overall organizational reputation. they suggest in which customers’ This study’s ﬁndings do not support this proposition. Rather, a mediated relationship between quality of products/services and organizational repu- tation, satisfaction plays a signiﬁcant mediating role. These ﬁndings suggest that high-quality products/ services alone do not ensure a favorable organizational reputation. Many ﬁrms developed high-quality products that were rejected by potential customers soon after their introduction to the market. This fact does not imply that the high quality of products/services is not an important factor in creating a favorable organizational repu- tation. Rather, it suggests that this factor alone is not suﬃcient to guarantee organi- zational reputation. Only high quality pro- ducts/services customers’ expectations and assure customers’ satisfac- tion create a suﬃcient condition for a favorable organizational reputation. The case of Ford’s Edsel is a good example of this situation. In the ﬁrst half of the 1950s, Ford decided to develop a moderately priced car. Extensive market studies were conducted at that time to detect customers’ preference for this type of car. The Edsel was introduced to the market in 1957 and soon became a major failure. The public expected a vehicle that provided a signiﬁ- cant advancement toward something that had never been seen before. The Edsel had a new design and was a powerful vehicle, but it failed to meet customers’ expecta- tions and, hence, preferences (satisfaction). that meet use of multivariate This study’s ﬁndings suggest that per- ceived organizational reputation inﬂuences the ﬁrm’s performance. The results support the performance measures. Building a favorable organiza- tional reputation is a lengthy and costly process and the returns on organizational reputation should be expected in the long term. Thus, the authors expect organiza- tional reputation to have a direct eﬀect on the ﬁrm’s growth and accumulation of cus- Carmeli and Tishler Page 25 Perceived Organizational Reputation and Organizational Performance tomers’ orders. This ﬁnding is consistent with the results of Yoon et al. (1993), who suggest that the intention to buy an insur- ance program is a function of the insurance company’s reputation. Top management should not expect a quick return on repu- tation. Rather, they need to acknowledge that building reputation as a strategic resource and positioning it as a sustainable competitive advantage is achieved, as in Southwest Airlines, by a large number of activities that complement and strengthen each other (Porter, 1996). the The return on reputation eventually will be gained by converting the ﬁrm’s growth into larger market share and sustained prof- itability. Domination in relevant market is extremely important in setting new rules and standards, as well as barriers to entry that enable ﬁrms to charge pre- miums. The domination of Microsoft in the market for PC operating systems is an important reason for its high proﬁtability. Top management should not perceive their ﬁrm’s growth as the ultimate and only goal. Rather, the ﬁrm’s growth is one of two (market share is the other) mediator variables for gaining high proﬁtability. Finally, these results show that sustained ﬁnancial strength is a function of the ﬁrm’s proﬁtability and is not directly aﬀected by market share. This ﬁnding suggests that top management should be aware that market share is by no means an assurance of ﬁnancial strength. Market share serves only as an indicator of the ﬁrm’s current proﬁtability. Limitations of the Study and Suggestions for Future Research Several limitations of this study should be mentioned. First, although the study relies on the growing body of literature about resource-based strategy and organizational reputation, the model presented here is new and the data must be cautiously inter- preted. Secondly, the empirical model pro- Page 26 further the perceptions of posed here is a preliminary method that should be put to other tests. Thirdly, data from a particular set of industrial enter- prises were used; investigations should be conducted on other data sets and other types of organizations in order to extend the validity of this model. Fourthly, two variables (customer satisfaction and quality of products/services) are single-item scales and, thus, should be interpreted cau- tiously. Finally, the industrial enterprises’ CEOs were exam- ined. Clearly, using single-source data is a major limitation. This research design may yield response bias towards overestimating the prestige of an organization. Some sec- ondary data, which were available to com- pare responses to performance measures such as growth and return on sales with the responses received, were used. This comparison, although for a very small number of ﬁrms, indicated that the CEOs’ responses represented the secondary data quite well. A further examination yielded no relationship between CEOs’ tenure in the organization and their perceptions of organizational reputation (r = 0.06, n.s.). This ﬁnding indicates that the mean level of reported perceived organizational repu- tation by leaders with little experience in their position was statistically equivalent to the reports of leaders who had longer experience in their position. If leaders’ ego- centric biases signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced their reports of perceived organizational reputa- tion, longer-tenured leaders would likely have reported, on average, higher levels of perceived organizational reputation than short-tenured leaders.4 Finally, the results from Harman’s one-factor test (Podsakoﬀ et al., 2003; Podsakoﬀ and Organ, 1986) suggest that one dominant factor did not emerge, because it accounts for only a the variance. relatively small part of Assuming that the ﬁrms are privately held, the authors believe that one direction for future research, the vast majority of which may overcome the possibility of response bias, is to investigate other stake- holders’ perceptions. Clearly, this research strategy requires a lot of resources. should Future attempt research reputation plays explored the birth of to empirically validate the theoretical premise that organizational a strategic role in creating a sustainable competitive advantage and superior perfor- mance with respect to multiple stake- holders. A recent interesting research path has capabilities (Helfat and Lieberman, 2002). Reputation research may follow this path in order to understand the process by which prestige emerges. Understanding this process has the potential to explain the role that strate- gic reputation plays in diﬀerent situations. Researchers may need to use multivariate measures and multivariate analysis in order to uncover the interrelationships between organizational reputation and multiple per- formance measures. More should be done to explore complex relationships between quality of products/services, custo- mers’ satisfaction and organizational repu- tation. The present study’s results imply that ﬁrms may need to account for several types of reputation, including reputation based on the quality of products/services and reputation based on the customers’ satisfaction. the ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors wish to thank two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions on an earlier draft of this manuscript. NOTES 1 Other studies attempted to assess the construed external image (Dutton et al., 1994) and per- ceived/construed external prestige (eg Carmeli, 2005; Smidts et al., 2001). The present study aims to explore the overall status or reputation of the ﬁrm through its CEO’s evaluation, which is likely to reconcile how they view the ﬁrm and how others think of the ﬁrm. Carmeli and Tishler accounting data. These measures 2 The performance measures in this study are based on are commonly used for the evaluation of the ﬁrm’s performance (Barney, 1997: 36–43). The diﬃculties in obtaining data from private ﬁrms (most of the ﬁrms in this study are private ﬁrms) and the shortcomings of these data were previously discussed in Daily, 1995. in organization studies of and/or quality services 3 Respondents were asked to report how their ﬁrm’s products compares with their rivals. A similar item was also included, using a diﬀerent question (the respondents were to indicate whether they agreed or disagreed that their ﬁrm features high quality of products and/or services), in the measure of the quality of the ﬁrm’s products and/or services. The correlation between the two items was 0.37, sug- gesting that they were suﬃciently diﬀerent from each other. 4 The authors believe that the non-signiﬁcant corre- lation between a CEO’s tenure and perceived orga- nizational reputation indicates that this study does not suﬀer from severe response bias. However, this correlation need not be an informative measure of this phenomenon. Thanks go to a referee for this point. REFERENCES Aaker, D.A. (1989) ‘Managing assets and skills.
