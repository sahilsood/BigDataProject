Our analysis reveals that both customer service representatives (CSRs) and managers employed in outsourced call centres earn 91 per cent of the cash pay earned by their in-house counterparts. Lower cash pay levels in outsourced call centres are related to higher CSR quit rates and absenteeism. Although CSR cash pay is associated with improved workforce performance, the disparity in cash pay between in-house and outsourced call centres does not result in a signiﬁcant difference in workforce performance. 1. Introduction Outsourcing is a common practice for many organizations as they choose between performing work in-house or outsourcing it to external suppliers. Empirical research on employment conditions in outsourcing organizations is sparse. The few existing studies focus on pay differences between employ- ees of outsourced organizations and in-house organizations (e.g. Abraham and Taylor 1996; Berlinski 2008; Dube and Kaplan 2010). Some factors — skill differences, industry characteristics and lower hours — have been con- sidered as potential mechanisms inﬂuencing lower pay in outsourced ﬁrms but do not offer a comprehensive explanation. Thus, several questions about The two authors contributed equally to this article and thus are listed in alphabetical order.

Moreover, little is known about the implications of this pay disparity for the management of out- sourced organizations. Furthering our understanding of lower pay levels and their consequences in outsourced organizations is important because out- sourcing is growing (Bhagwati et al. 2004). As many outsourced organiza- tions encounter competitive pressures to reduce expenditures, employee compensation, the single largest operational cost in most organizations (Gerhart et al. 2009), is an especially important human resource management (HRM) practice. We investigate several questions about compensation management in outsourced organizations. First, does this pay disparity for employees transfer to managers? If it exists for managers, is it similar in magnitude to the one for employees? Second, is there a similar disparity in beneﬁts between in-house and outsourced organizations? Few studies of outsourc- ing organizations examine the possible disparity in employee beneﬁts, which represents a signiﬁcant portion of payroll expenditures (Bates 2003).1 Third, what is the relationship among outsourcing status, em- ployee compensation and other HRM practices? Finally, what are the implications of adopting a less generous pay policy for outsourced orga- nizations? By addressing these questions, we present a comprehen- sive picture of in outsourced service organizations. compensation management We analyse original establishment-level data from in-house and out- sourced call centres located in Canada. In contrast to other outsourcing studies that have examined individual-level data collected in the USA (e.g. Current Population Survey; Berlinski 2008; Dube and Kaplan 2010), we focus on the establishment level. Considering organization-level factors (e.g. call centre characteristics, HRM practices) will provide new insights over- looked by previous outsourcing studies. Canada is an interesting laboratory for examining the outsourcing of customer service work because US and UK ﬁrms often outsource customer service work to India and Canada (van Jaarsveld et al. 2009). We ﬁnd, consistent with Berlinski (2008) and Dube and Kaplan (2010), signiﬁcant pay disparities for employees between in-house and outsourced call centres. Managers employed by outsourced organizations also earn sig- niﬁcantly less cash pay than their in-house counterparts, and this pay gap is similar in size for both customer service representatives (CSRs) and man- agers. In-house and outsourced call centres also differ in the HRM prac- tices they adopt, and these choices contribute to the disparity in CSR cash pay. Turning to the consequences of less generous compensation, lower cash pay is associated with higher CSR quit rates and CSR absenteeism in outsourced call centres, two factors that have been shown to increase customer turnover (Heskett et al. 1997). In addition, CSR cash pay is sig- niﬁcantly associated with workforce performance, but we fail to ﬁnd evi- dence that lower pay in outsourced centres leads to lower workforce performance. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2010. Compensation in Outsourced Organizations s3 2. Prior literature and theoretical framework Inter-organizational Differences in Compensation Competitive labour markets should eliminate wage gaps among employees who perform similar jobs, yet abundant evidence shows that wage rates vary across organizations (Gerhart and Milkovich 1990; Gerlach and Stephan 2006). Workforce characteristics, organizational size, union presence, indus- try and geographic location account for employee pay differences (Becker 1975; Dunlop 1957; Freeman and Medoff 1984; Krueger and Summers 1988; Shapiro and Stiglitz 1984). Beyond these factors, management scholars argue that organizational context, including organizational structure and corporate strategy, inﬂuences an organizational compensation system (Gomez-Mejia and Balkin 1992; Milkovich 1988). Decisions about an organization’s compensation system are shaped by ﬁt with organizational context and its implications for orga- nizational effectiveness. As a result, systematic variation in compensation systems exists across organizations within the same industry. We argue that outsourcing status is an important contextual factor that affects compensa- tion systems. Aside from compensation, strategic HRM researchers have emphasized the importance of ﬁt between a set of HRM practices and the organizational context (Schuler and Jackson 1987). In this framework, a compensation system is likely to be associated with a speciﬁc set of HRM practices that are aligned with the organizational context. Consistent with this perspective, some organizational differences in compensation systems may be explained by organizational decisions about other HRM practices rather than choices about compensation. Call centre research, however, shows mixed evidence that compensation management is related to other HRM practices (Batt 2001; Wood et al. 2006). These mixed ﬁndings could be the result of institu- tional differences or variation in the set of HRM practices included in the analyses. Differences in Compensation between In-House and Outsourced Call Centres Indeed, several factors inﬂuence the outsourcing decision including the need to increase ﬂexibility in stafﬁng levels, reduce labour costs and capitalize on economies of scale for providing specialized services (Abraham and Taylor 1996). However, cost savings is a primary motivator for outsourcing (Doell- gast et al. 2009; Harrison and Kelley 1993). According to transaction cost economics, organizations outsource work if the costs associated with out- sourcing (e.g. fees for external suppliers and transaction costs) are less than the costs associated with internalization (e.g. production costs, acquisition and maintenance of physical and human assets) (Williamson 1975, 1985). For outsourced organizations, preserving a cost advantage in order to attract business is crucial. They can achieve this goal by adopting a low-cost man- agement system or hiring and developing a high-quality workforce to © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2010. s4 British Journal of Industrial Relations improve employee productivity. Nevertheless, efforts to increase productivity do not alleviate pressures to reduce costs, a critical issue for outsourced call centres competing with outsourced suppliers in lower-wage countries and with retaining the work in-house (Batt et al. 2005; Doh 2005). In order to preserve a cost advantage over their competitors, we expect outsourced call centres to reduce their labour costs, thereby inﬂuencing them to pay their CSRs less than their in-house counterparts. Outsourced call centres’ intention to control employment costs will inﬂu- ence other aspects of HRM. First, outsourced call centres may hire CSRs with limited human capital to reduce compensation expenditures and design customer service work so that low-quality workers can perform tasks (e.g. standardizing work procedures). Second, they can reduce expenditures asso- ciated with other HRM practices such as hiring and training costs (Doellgast et al. 2009). Third, outsourced centres are less likely to be unionized (Doell- gast 2008), removing potential obstacles preventing the adoption of a low- cost management system. Together, these choices are likely to be associated with lower CSR pay, suggesting that these factors may contribute to the observed pay disparity. However, we argue that outsourced call centres have a clear intention to reduce employee compensation to support their strategic orientation (i.e. cost advantage). We control for other HRM practices in our analysis rather than as outcomes of outsourcing, allowing us to rule out the possibility that pay-level differences between in-house and outsourced call centres reﬂect variations in other HRM practices that may result from out- sourcing decisions. Little is known about managerial pay in outsourced call centres in com- parison with their in-house counterparts. On the one hand, limiting com- pensation for managers could give outsourced call centres an additional cost advantage over performing the work in-house. On the other hand, a low-cost operation could also increase CSR dissatisfaction, emotional exhaustion and burnout thereby increasing job demands for managers and, in turn, their compensation expectations. Out- sourced call centres might choose to suppress manager pay levels to pre- serve their competitive advantage in the marketplace, but only to the extent that it avoids difﬁculties in attracting and retaining applicants for manage- rial positions. Therefore, we expect that outsourced managers are paid less than in-house managers, but the manager pay differential may be narrower than the CSR pay differential between in-house and outsourced call centres. (Deery et al. 2002), Consequences of the Outsourced Pay Differential: Quit Rates and Absenteeism Outsourced centres paying CSRs less than in-house centres risk an increase in CSR withdrawal behaviours (e.g. quits and absenteeism). Higher turnover and absenteeism are especially problematic for call centres because these behaviours are related to customer turnover (Heskett et al. 1997). © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2010. Compensation in Outsourced Organizations s5 In both organizational-level and individual-level turnover research, the negative relationship between pay and actual quits is robust (Barber and Bretz 2000; Griffeth et al. 2000; Shaw et al. 1998). The pay differential is likely to be associated with higher CSR quit rates in outsourced call centres. Indeed, Holman et al. (2009) reported that quit rates in outsourced call centres were higher than in in-house call centres, without controlling for wage levels. In the present study, we predict higher quit rates in outsourced call centres compared with in-house call centres and consider lower pay as a primary explanation for the expected higher quit rates. Theories offer ambiguous predictions about the relationship between pay and absenteeism. Equity theory (Adams 1965) suggests that lower pay is associated with higher absenteeism. In a study of employees working in 500 branches of a Danish bank, Kristensen et al. (2006) found higher rates of absenteeism in branches with lower salaries. In contrast, economic theory views absenteeism as an outcome related to the labour supply being inﬂu- enced by the cost employees incur when they are absent (Allen 1981). Lower pay may increase absenteeism because employees are unmotivated to attend work. In the low-wage context, however, employees may lack the ﬁnancial freedom to be absent. The relationship between pay and absenteeism will depend on the magnitude of these two opposing effects (Dalton and Perry 1981). Thus, we investigate whether the expected pay disparity is associated with higher CSR absenteeism in outsourced call centres. Consequences of the Outsourced Pay Differential: Workforce Performance The academic literature provides much less guidance on the question of whether in-house and outsourced organizations differ on workforce perfor- mance. We expect that the pay disparity between in-house and outsourced call centres yields variation in workforce performance for several reasons. First, if lower pay is associated with higher quit rates and absenteeism, workforce performance is likely to decline accordingly. Several empirical studies have demonstrated the negative impact of higher quit rates on work- force performance (Shaw et al. 2005), although few empirical studies examine the relationship between absenteeism and workforce performance. In addi- tion to physically withdrawing from the workplace, reducing effort is another possible employee reaction to lower pay. Consequently, outsourced CSRs who are paid less than in-house CSRs may perform less well. Second, efﬁ- ciency wage theory (Shapiro and Stiglitz 1984) points to the possible negative relationship between pay level and work motivation. Paying above market pay rates will prevent employees from shirking because they are more inter- ested in retaining higher-paying jobs. This mechanism is unlikely in out- sourced call centres, where the cash pay for employees is expected to be signiﬁcantly lower than in in-house call centres. Finally, outsourced call centres are more likely to adopt a low-cost HRM system, and this decision could have a negative effect on workforce perfor- mance. Extant call centre research shows that using a high-involvement © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2010. s6 British Journal of Industrial Relations HRM approach deﬁned by job security, generous compensation, and empowering employees is associated with improvements in employee and customer satisfaction, sales productivity, sales growth, service quality, and net revenues (Batt 2002; Batt and Moynihan 2002). A key component of the high-involvement HRM approach, a generous pay policy, is likely to be associated with improved workforce performance. We expect that out- sourced call centres are less likely to adopt a high-involvement HRM approach as it could increase employment-related expenditures. 3. Methods Context This study is a part of ‘the Global Call Centre Project’ (see Batt et al. 2009 for details). In comparison with other countries participating in the project, Canada has a disproportionate share of outsourced call centres (Holman et al. 2007). Interviews with industry experts uncovered considerable efforts by economic development agencies in Canada to attract customer service work from other countries during the 1990s, resulting in the widespread presence of outsourced call centres (van Jaarsveld et al. 2009). Sample The population of this study included all call centres in Canada. Call centres are an emerging sector with unclear industry boundaries, so conventional industry classiﬁcations such as the North American Industry Classiﬁcation System lack a speciﬁc category for call centres (Batt et al. 2009). For this reason, we developed a database based on membership lists of provincial call centres and a national governmental-level sector council ‘Contact Centre Canada’, interviews with industry experts, and Internet research. Our effort yielded a list of 3,000 call centres spanning all provinces and a wide cross- section of industries. From this list, we randomly selected 580 call centres to survey. We surveyed call centre establishments by phone between February 2005 and July 2006. The establishment level of analysis is appropriate because pay level is likely to differ across establishments within a single corporation, reﬂecting variation in the economic environment, and is considered more reliable than corporate-level surveys (Gerhart et al. 2000a). We supple- mented the survey developed for the Global Call Centre Project with addi- tional questions about aspects of compensation and labour market conditions we address in this article. For inclusion in this study, centres needed to employ at least 10 employees, and each eligible call centre was asked to select an individual (e.g. contact centre manager, site director) who was most familiar with daily operations to complete the survey. We engaged in site visits to ensure the validity and reliability of our measures. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2010. Compensation in Outsourced Organizations s7 The response rate was 70 per cent with 406 usable responses, although the choice of variables reduced the sample to 251 usable cases. The number of observations removed from the initial sample is slightly higher than in com- parable studies (Colvin et al. 2001). We used a pairwise t-test to examine whether signiﬁcant differences existed in our key variables between our ﬁnal sample and the cases that were removed. We found no signiﬁcant differences with the exception of CSR absenteeism, which was signiﬁcantly lower in our ﬁnal sample (p < 0.05). For this reason, the results for CSR absenteeism may need to be interpreted cautiously. Measures Measures used in our analysis are described in the Appendix. Three catego- ries of dependent variables are (i) CSR and manager pay level; (ii) CSR withdrawal-related behaviours; and (iii) workforce performance. Pay level was measured with cash pay and beneﬁts level for CSRs and managers while CSR withdrawal-related behaviours consisted of CSR quit rate and CSR absenteeism. Consistent with previous call centre studies (Castilla 2008; Wood et al. 2006), we used three workforce performance measures: (i) call abandonment rate; (ii) meeting target time; and (iii) average call handling time. The independent variable, outsourcing status, indicated whether or not the call centre was outsourced. In our ﬁnal sample, 37.5 per cent or 94 cases (out of 251 cases) were outsourced, and 62.5 per cent or 157 cases were in-house. We included three categories of control variables: (i) workforce character- istics; (ii) organizational characteristics; and (iii) HRM practices. Measures of HRM practices were based on previous call centre studies (Batt 2002; Colvin et al. 2001). When estimating pay level and withdrawal-related behaviours, we also controlled for the economic environment using the 2006 average regional unemployment rate and 2006 median local earnings data (Statistics Canada 2008). We excluded these labour market variables when estimating workforce performance because they are unlikely to inﬂuence CSR performance.2 Analytical Approach We used (i) ordinary least squares regression to evaluate differences between in-house and outsourced call centres in CSR cash pay, manager cash pay, and average call handling time; and (ii) tobit analysis (PROC LIFE REG in SAS, Ver. 9.1) to analyse CSR beneﬁts level, manager beneﬁts level, CSR quit rate, CSR absenteeism, call abandonment rate and meeting target time. We used tobit regression for these variables because meeting target time is both left and right censored at 0 and 100, while the other variables are left censored at 0 (Maddala 1992). © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2010. s8 British Journal of Industrial Relations 4. Results Descriptive Results Table 1 compares the variables of interest for in-house and outsourced centres. For easier interpretation, we present the means and the results of pairwise t-tests calculated before transformation. CSRs and managers employed in outsourced centres earn signiﬁcantly less cash pay and beneﬁts than their in-house counterparts. CSR quit rates and CSR absenteeism in outsourced centres are signiﬁcantly higher than in in-house centres. Consid- ering workforce performance, the results are mixed with signiﬁcantly lower call abandonment rates in outsourced call centres and signiﬁcantly shorter average call handling time in in-house call centres, suggesting that in-house CSRs handle calls more efﬁciently. Table 2 reports means, standard devia- tions and correlation matrix. Multivariate Analysis (a) Cash pay In Table 3, we present the results for CSR and manager cash pay. We added variables in hierarchical order. For CSR cash pay, we added economic envi- ronment and organizational characteristics including outsourcing status in Model 1. In Model 2, we added CSR workforce characteristics, and in Model 3, HRM practices. For managers’ cash pay level, we followed the same steps, but in Model 2 we added managers’ workforce characteristics, and in Model 3, managers’ HRM practices and HRM practices applied to CSRs since Colvin et al. (2001) found that HRM practices that cover the workforce are associated with pay for both employees and managers. In Model 3, we ﬁnd that outsourced call centres pay their CSRs and managers signiﬁcantly less cash pay than in-house call centres. The beta coefﬁcients for outsourcing status in Model 3 are very similar when compar- ing CSR cash pay and manager cash pay (b = -0.099 for both), suggesting that both outsourced CSRs and managers earn 91 per cent (exp (-0.099)) of the cash pay their in-house counterparts earn. Contrary to our expectations, the pay disparity between outsourced and in-house CSRs is similar in magnitude to the pay disparity between outsourced managers and in-house managers. The addition of workforce characteristics and HRM practices consider- ably reduced the effect of outsourcing status (CSR cash pay: b = -0.163 (Model 1) to b = -0.099 (Model 3); manager cash pay: b = -0.118 (Model 1) to b = -0.099 (Model 3)). Thus, some of the difference in cash pay for outsourced CSRs is accounted for by these factors. For example, the number of emails CSRs receive per day from management and the amount of initial training for CSRs are both associated with CSRs earning more cash pay. This pattern could be interpreted as the employer trying to capitalize on em- ployee contributions to organizational effectiveness as suggested by the © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2010. Compensation in Outsourced Organizations s9 Mean Comparison for In-house and Outsourced Call Centres TABLE 1 Variable In-house call centres Outsourced call centres Pairwise t-test Compensation CSR cash pay CSR beneﬁts Manager cash pay Manager beneﬁts Quit rate CSR quit rate Absenteeism CSR absenteeism Workforce performance Call abandonment rate Meeting target time Average call handle time Economic environment Unemployment rate Median local earnings Organizational characteristics Part of a larger organization Call centre size Union presence Proportion female CSRs Average workweek length Outbound Job complexity CSR workforce characteristics Community college degree University degree or higher CSR tenure Managers’ workforce characteristics Community college degree University degree or higher Manager tenure CSR HRM practices CSR-manager ratio Emails per day Electronic monitoring Job discretion Systematic selection tests Initial training days Formal training days Self-directed team Problem solving teams Financial incentives Managers’ HRM practice Financial incentives $35,129 $6,266 $62,969 $12,875 10.5% 4.4% 5.0% 82.3% 279 seconds 5.6% $42,170 88.5% 118.0 21.7% 73.3% 38.0 8.9% 25.7 weeks 32.5% 26.1% 6.4 years 18.2% 76.9% 8.9 years 13.3 6.9 52.4% 2.9 42.7% 28.8 days 8.5 days 28.2% 48.8% 1.1% 1.1% $26,818 $3,741 $51,699 $6,361 22.1% 7.0% 3.7% 83.5% 348 seconds 6.5% $41,290 70.2% 217.4 6.4% 67.8% 38.3 33.0% 15.9 weeks 23.4% 20.2% 3.6 years 12.9% 78.5% 5.2 years 15.3 4.1 69.4% 2.5 51.6% 24.5 days 8.1 days 20.8% 38.1% 1.3% 1.5% *** *** *** *** *** *** ** ** *** *** *** *** ** *** *** *** *** *** *** *** ** * Note: Ns = 110–157 for in-house call centres and 69–94 for outsourced call centres. * Signiﬁcant at 10%; ** Signiﬁcant at 5%; *** Signiﬁcant at 1%.

We added variables in hierarchical order. For both CSR and manager beneﬁts, the effect of outsourcing is negative and signiﬁcant in Models 1 and 2; however, once we included CSR HR practices, it became insigniﬁcant (p = 0.26 for CSR beneﬁts; p = 0.22 for manager beneﬁts). Despite being insigniﬁcant, the signs of the beta coefﬁcients for outsourcing status are consistently negative, and the size of beta coefﬁcient is similar (b = -0.220 for CSR beneﬁts and b = -0.225 for manager beneﬁts). The lower value of beneﬁts offered by outsourced call centres appears to be accounted for, in part, by other HR practices because their inclusion resulted in an insigniﬁcant effect of outsourcing on the value of CSR beneﬁts. For example, in Model 3, the number of emails CSRs receive per day from management, job discretion and the use of systematic selection tests are positively associated with the value of CSR beneﬁts. Among these variables, the number of emails CSRs receive per day from management and job discretion are signiﬁcantly associated with outsourc- ing status as suggested in Table 2. This ﬁnding may suggest that outsourced call centres use less sophisticated HR systems and may limit beneﬁts for CSRs. Turning to managers, Model 1 is the best model because neither Model 2 nor Model 3 improved upon Model 1’s ﬁt. Yet we expected that outsourced call centres would have a clear intention to constrain employ- ees’ beneﬁts to preserve a cost advantage over and above hiring different types of workers and altering other HR practices. We evaluate this expec- tation in Model 3 by including other HR practices, and we do not ﬁnd support for it. (c) CSR quit rates and absenteeism In Table 5, we display our results for quit rates and absenteeism. In Model 2, we added CSR cash pay because we are examining whether the pay disparity between in-house and outsourced centres is associated with quit rates and absenteeism. In analysing quit rates and absenteeism, we excluded beneﬁts level to maximize the sample size. We also excluded CSR tenure when esti- mating quit rates because they are theoretically and empirically related (Trevor and Nyberg 2008). CSR quit rates are signiﬁcantly higher in outsourced call centres than in in-house call centres (Model 1). CSR cash pay is signiﬁcantly associated with CSR quit rates (Model 2). Adding CSR cash pay reduces the signiﬁ- cance level of outsourcing status and its beta coefﬁcient by 17 per cent (b = 0.328 (Model 1); b = 0.271 (Model 2)). As we reported, outsourcing status is also signiﬁcantly related to CSR cash pay level. These results suggest that lower pay in outsourced call centres is associated with higher quit rates. Absenteeism is also signiﬁcantly higher in outsourced call centres (Model 1). With the addition of CSR cash pay (Model 2), the effect of CSR cash pay is signiﬁcant and the size of the coefﬁcient for outsourcing status decreased, © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2010. Compensation in Outsourced Organizations s15 3 l e d o M 2 l e d o M 1 l e d o M 3 l e d o M 2 l e d o M 1 l e d o M ) 5 8 1 . 0 ( 5 2 2 . 0 - ) 0 8 1 . 0 ( * * 6 5 3 . 0 - ) 9 7 1 . 0 ( * * 2 7 3 . 0 - ) 6 9 1 . 0 ( 0 2 2 . 0 - ) 3 9 1 . 0 ( * 2 2 3 . 0 - ) 2 9 1 . 0 ( * 7 6 3 . 0 - ) 3 3 2 . 0 ( ) 4 8 6 . 0 ( 0 7 2 . 0 5 1 1 . 0 ) 2 2 2 . 0 ( ) 7 6 6 . 0 ( 9 8 1 . 0 0 8 0 . 0 - ) 5 1 2 . 0 ( ) 7 5 6 . 0 ( 6 0 2 . 0 5 2 0 . 0 - ) 5 5 2 . 0 ( ) 6 5 7 . 0 ( 1 7 2 . 0 7 5 5 . 0 ) 5 5 2 . 0 ( ) 6 7 7 . 0 ( 8 7 1 . 0 1 4 3 . 0 ) 7 5 2 . 0 ( ) 2 6 7 . 0 ( 7 3 1 . 0 5 3 0 . 0 - ) 3 0 2 . 0 ( * 3 7 3 . 0 ) 8 6 0 . 0 ( ) 4 1 2 . 0 ( ) 4 5 3 . 0 ( ) 9 1 0 . 0 ( ) 9 1 2 . 0 ( ) 5 0 0 . 0 ( 6 1 0 . 0 - 3 0 0 . 0 - 8 0 1 . 0 4 2 0 . 0 3 0 0 . 0 1 0 1 . 0 - ) 3 0 2 . 0 ( * * 7 0 4 . 0 ) 9 5 0 . 0 ( ) 4 1 2 . 0 ( ) 5 4 3 . 0 ( ) 9 1 0 . 0 ( ) 9 9 1 . 0 ( ) 4 0 0 . 0 ( 0 3 0 . 0 9 6 0 . 0 - 2 3 2 . 0 7 1 0 . 0 3 0 0 . 0 9 7 1 . 0 - ) 1 0 2 . 0 ( * * 7 2 4 . 0 ) 9 5 0 . 0 ( ) 1 0 2 . 0 ( ) 2 4 3 . 0 ( ) 9 1 0 . 0 ( ) 7 9 1 . 0 ( ) 4 0 0 . 0 ( 7 2 0 . 0 8 0 0 . 0 - 8 5 2 . 0 8 1 0 . 0 4 0 0 . 0 6 8 1 . 0 - ) 9 2 2 . 0 ( ) 8 7 0 . 0 ( ) 2 3 2 . 0 ( ) 3 7 3 . 0 ( 2 4 1 . 0 - 1 1 0 . 0 5 3 1 . 0 3 8 4 . 0 - ) 0 2 0 . 0 ( * * 1 4 0 . 0 ) 5 4 2 . 0 ( ) 5 0 0 . 0 ( 5 4 2 . 0 - 1 0 0 . 0 - ) 6 7 1 . 0 ( ) 3 5 1 . 0 ( ) 5 1 0 . 0 ( 0 5 1 . 0 9 4 0 . 0 - 1 0 0 . 0 ) 9 7 1 . 0 ( ) 1 5 1 . 0 ( ) 5 1 0 . 0 ( 1 7 0 . 0 5 2 0 . 0 - 9 0 0 . 0 ) 7 1 0 . 0 ( * * * 0 5 0 . 0 ) 5 7 1 . 0 ( ) 1 8 1 . 0 ( 4 4 1 . 0 - 8 5 0 . 0 - ) 7 3 2 . 0 ( ) 5 6 0 . 0 ( ) 5 3 2 . 0 ( ) 9 7 3 . 0 ( ) 0 2 0 . 0 ( ) 5 3 2 . 0 ( ) 5 0 0 . 0 ( 4 4 1 . 0 - 0 5 0 . 0 3 0 2 . 0 2 3 5 . 0 - 9 2 0 . 0 5 4 3 . 0 - 2 0 0 . 0 ) 7 1 0 . 0 ( * * 6 3 0 . 0 ) 3 7 1 . 0 ( ) 4 7 1 . 0 ( 1 0 0 . 0 1 0 1 . 0 ) 8 3 2 . 0 ( ) 4 6 0 . 0 ( ) 7 1 2 . 0 ( ) 6 7 3 . 0 ( ) 0 2 0 . 0 ( ) 7 3 2 . 0 ( ) 5 0 0 . 0 ( 4 8 0 . 0 - 9 1 0 . 0 2 2 3 . 0 5 6 5 . 0 - 1 3 0 . 0 5 5 3 . 0 - 3 0 0 . 0 n o i t a z i n a g r o r e g r a l a f o i s g n n r a e l a c o l n a i d e m g o L e t a r t n e m y o p m e n u l g o L s c i t s i r e t c a r a h c l a n o i t a z i n a g r O e z i s e r t n e c l l a c e c n e s e r p i n o n U t r a P g o L h t g n e l k e e w k r o w e g a r e v A s R S C e l a m e f n o i t r o p o r P t n e m n o r i v n e c i m o n o c E s u t a t s g n i c r u o s t u O y t i x e l p m o c b o J d n u o b t u O e e r g e d e g e l l o c y t i n u m m o C r e h g i h r o e e r g e d y t i s r e v i n U s c i t s i r e t c a r a h c e c r o f k r o w R S C e c r o f k r o w ’ s r e g a n a M s c i t s i r e t c a r a h c e r u n e T e e r g e d e g e l l o c y t i n u m m o C r e h g i h r o e e r g e d y t i s r e v i n U e r u n e T s e l b a i r a V t n e d n e p e D s a 4 E L B A T l e v e L s t ﬁ e n e B r e g a n a M d n a R S C h t i w s t l u s e R n o i s s e r g e R ) t i b o T ( l e v e l s t ﬁ e n e b r e g a n a M g o L ) t i b o T ( l e v e l s t ﬁ e n e b R S C g o L e l b a i r a V © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2010. s16 British Journal of Industrial Relations ) t i b o T ( l e v e l s t ﬁ e n e b r e g a n a M g o L ) t i b o T ( l e v e l s t ﬁ e n e b R S C g o L 3 l e d o M 2 l e d o M 1 l e d o M 3 l e d o M 2 l e d o M 1 l e d o M ) d t n o c ( 4 E L B A T e l b a i r a V ) 7 6 0 . 0 ( ) 3 7 0 . 0 ( ) 2 0 0 . 0 ( ) 3 0 1 . 0 ( ) 0 3 0 . 0 ( ) 0 1 1 . 0 ( ) 9 9 0 . 0 ( ) 6 3 0 . 0 ( ) 0 5 0 . 0 ( ) 5 5 0 . 0 ( 9 2 0 . 0 3 5 0 . 0 - 2 0 0 . 0 - 3 3 1 . 0 8 4 0 . 0 ) 0 8 0 . 0 ( * * 6 5 1 . 0 ) 2 0 0 . 0 ( 1 0 0 . 0 - ) 9 7 0 . 0 ( 1 9 0 . 0 ) 3 1 1 . 0 ( * * * 8 4 3 . 0 ) 3 3 0 . 0 ( * 9 5 0 . 0 3 5 1 . 0 9 4 0 . 0 4 4 0 . 0 7 4 0 . 0 - 1 5 0 . 0 - ) 3 1 1 . 0 ( ) 5 1 1 . 0 ( ) 8 3 0 . 0 ( ) 8 5 0 . 0 ( ) 5 5 0 . 0 ( 9 4 0 . 0 9 3 0 . 0 - 0 4 0 . 0 - 9 6 0 . 0 - 6 6 0 . 0 ) 2 5 0 . 0 ( ) 9 1 7 . 7 ( 8 3 0 . 0 7 4 9 . 4 ) 9 8 3 . 7 ( 0 5 0 . 8 ) 4 5 2 . 7 ( 7 9 3 . 7 ) 9 5 4 . 8 ( 1 9 1 . 0 - ) 2 8 5 . 8 ( 2 4 8 . 3 ) 4 0 4 . 8 ( 7 8 9 . 7 n o i t c e l e s c i t a m e t s y s n o i t e r c s i d g n i r o t i n o m c i n o r t c e l e y a d r e p s l i a m e o i t a r r e g a n a m – R S C g o L s e c i t c a r p M R H R S C s y a d i g n n i a r t l a m r o f s y a d i g n n i a r t l a i t i n i s m a e t d e t c e r i d - f l e s s m a e t g n i v l o s s e v i t n e c n i m e l b o r p l a i c n a n ﬁ s e v i t n e c n i l a i c n a n ﬁ g o L s e c i t c a r p M R H ’ s r e g a n a M t n a t s n o C s t s e t g o L g o L b o J g o L g o L g o L g o L g o L g o L t o n t u b d e d u l c n i e r a s e i m m u d t e k r a m y r a m i r p e v ﬁ d n a s e i m m u d y r t s u d n i o w t - y t n e w T . ) ( e d i s n i e r a s r o r r e d r a d n a t s ;

CSR, customer service representative; HRM, human resource management. supporting our argument that disparity in cash pay accounts for higher rates of CSR absenteeism in outsourced call centres. The evidence for absenteeism is somewhat weaker than it is for quit rates as illustrated by a smaller reduction in the beta coefﬁcient for outsourcing status (b = 0.321 (Model 1); b = 0.294 (Model 2), about 8.4 per cent). (d) Workforce performance Finally, we considered whether lower CSR pay in outsourced call centres is associated with lower workforce performance. In Table 6, we present two models for each workforce performance measure. Model 1 excludes CSR cash pay, while Model 2 includes this variable. Overall, our analysis does not offer strong evidence that outsourced CSRs perform worse than in-house CSRs. There is no signiﬁcant difference in call abandonment rate and meeting the target time between in-house and outsourced call centres, although average call handling time was longer in outsourced call centres (p < 0.10). © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2010. s18 British Journal of Industrial Relations 2 l e d o M 1 l e d o M 2 l e d o M 1 l e d o M 2 l e d o M 1 l e d o M ) 9 1 1 . 0 ( * 3 2 2 . 0 ) 7 1 1 . 0 ( * 2 1 2 . 0 ) 0 2 2 . 2 ( 7 5 1 . 0 - ) 2 3 2 . 2 ( 3 8 7 . 0 - ) 2 0 9 . 0 ( 5 3 6 . 0 - ) 4 0 9 . 0 ( 7 4 2 . 0 - ) 3 1 1 . 0 ( * * 0 3 2 . 0 ) 4 1 1 . 0 ( * 6 9 1 . 0 ) 1 1 0 . 0 ( 2 1 0 . 0 - ) 2 1 1 . 0 ( * * 8 3 2 . 0 ) 1 1 1 . 0 ( * 7 0 2 . 0 ) 1 1 0 . 0 ( 0 1 0 . 0 - ) 4 3 0 . 2 ( * * 6 8 5 . 4 - ) 9 0 0 . 2 ( 8 8 1 . 0 ) 3 9 1 . 0 ( 9 4 1 . 0 ) 2 3 0 . 2 ( 8 7 4 . 0 ) 1 3 0 . 2 ( * 4 0 8 . 3 - ) 8 8 1 . 0 ( 2 7 2 . 0 ) 8 5 8 . 0 ( ) 1 5 8 . 0 ( ) 6 8 0 . 0 ( 5 7 4 . 0 - 6 0 5 . 0 - 1 4 0 . 0 ) 8 6 8 . 0 ( ) 3 5 8 . 0 ( ) 2 8 0 . 0 ( 4 0 6 . 0 - 0 3 8 . 0 - 8 2 0 . 0 - s e l b a i r a V t n e d n e p e D s a 6 E L B A T e c n a m r o f r e P e c r o f k r o W h t i w s t l u s e R n o i s s e r g e R ) S L O ( e m i t e l d n a h l l a c e g a r e v a g o L ) t i b o T ( e m i t t e g r a t g n i t e e M ) t i b o T ( e t a r t n e m n o d n a b A e l b a i r a V ) 5 4 0 . 0 ( * * * 2 2 1 . 0 ) 6 2 1 . 0 ( 7 8 0 . 0 ) 6 2 2 . 0 ( ) 1 4 1 . 0 ( * 5 9 3 . 0 - 7 4 1 . 0 - ) 3 0 0 . 0 ( * * 8 0 0 . 0 ) 4 1 0 . 0 ( ) 0 4 1 . 0 ( 8 1 0 . 0 4 0 0 . 0 ) 7 4 0 . 0 ( ) 0 5 0 . 0 ( ) 1 0 0 . 0 ( 1 1 0 . 0 - 3 6 0 . 0 1 0 0 . 0 - ) 5 6 0 . 0 ( * 8 0 1 . 0 ) 1 2 0 . 0 ( ) 1 7 0 . 0 ( ) 4 6 0 . 0 ( ) 4 2 0 . 0 ( ) 3 3 0 . 0 ( ) 6 3 0 . 0 ( ) 6 0 2 . 0 ( 3 0 0 . 0 - 0 7 0 . 0 - 1 4 0 . 0 4 0 0 . 0 7 0 0 . 0 - 2 6 0 . 0 - 2 1 1 . 0 ) 5 1 1 . 2 ( * 4 6 6 . 3 8 2 4 . 0 9 2 . 0 9 3 2 ) 4 4 0 . 0 ( * * * 1 2 1 . 0 ) 6 2 1 . 0 ( 8 8 0 . 0 ) 3 2 2 . 0 ( ) 1 4 1 . 0 ( * 4 1 4 . 0 - 1 4 1 . 0 - ) 4 1 0 . 0 ( ) 0 4 1 . 0 ( 9 1 0 . 0 4 0 0 . 0 ) 3 0 0 . 0 ( * * * 8 0 0 . 0 ) 7 4 0 . 0 ( ) 0 5 0 . 0 ( ) 1 0 0 . 0 ( 0 1 0 . 0 - 7 6 0 . 0 1 0 0 . 0 - ) 5 6 0 . 0 ( * 0 1 1 . 0 ) 1 2 0 . 0 ( ) 7 6 0 . 0 ( ) 4 6 0 . 0 ( ) 4 2 0 . 0 ( ) 3 3 0 . 0 ( ) 5 3 0 . 0 ( 4 0 0 . 0 - 9 5 0 . 0 - 6 3 0 . 0 5 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 . 0 - 9 5 0 . 0 - ) 1 0 7 . 0 ( * * * 5 4 7 . 4 7 2 4 . 0 9 3 2 ) 7 8 4 . 2 ( ) 2 7 7 . 0 ( ) 0 0 5 . 2 ( ) 9 2 7 . 4 ( ) 1 1 4 . 0 ( ) 9 5 2 . 3 ( ) 5 5 0 . 0 ( 8 5 5 . 1 9 5 5 . 0 - 1 4 4 . 0 - 6 1 9 . 0 - 2 1 0 . 0 6 3 7 . 3 1 2 0 . 0 - ) 1 0 8 . 0 ( ) 4 9 8 . 0 ( ) 9 1 0 . 0 ( ) 4 1 2 . 1 ( ) 9 7 3 . 0 ( ) 5 8 3 . 1 ( ) 3 5 1 . 1 ( ) 0 2 4 . 0 ( ) 2 2 6 . 0 ( ) 0 5 6 . 0 ( 2 1 6 . 0 7 9 5 . 0 - 1 2 0 . 0 9 9 3 . 1 0 6 0 . 0 7 9 0 . 1 - 3 3 3 . 1 4 3 2 . 0 4 8 7 . 0 4 4 0 . 0 - ) 7 8 5 . 3 ( * * 1 7 0 . 8 ) 2 8 3 . 7 3 ( 6 6 4 . 0 - * * 6 9 9 . 4 6 7 3 . 1 8 6 - ) 9 0 5 . 2 ( ) 0 8 7 . 0 ( ) 9 1 5 . 2 ( ) 7 0 7 . 4 ( ) 7 0 4 . 0 ( ) 6 9 2 . 3 ( ) 4 5 0 . 0 ( ) 6 0 8 . 0 ( ) 4 9 8 . 0 ( ) 9 1 0 . 0 ( ) 9 2 2 . 1 ( ) 4 8 3 . 0 ( ) 0 4 3 . 1 ( ) 9 3 1 . 1 ( ) 6 2 4 . 0 ( ) 7 2 6 . 0 ( ) 8 4 6 . 0 ( 6 3 0 . 1 9 8 6 . 0 - 8 5 0 . 0 8 1 9 . 2 - 6 0 2 . 0 7 8 1 . 4 7 0 0 . 0 7 2 8 . 0 8 6 2 . 0 - 1 2 0 . 0 8 3 5 . 1 9 2 0 . 0 0 7 1 . 0 - 2 5 7 . 0 3 5 2 . 0 7 0 1 . 0 6 4 0 . 1 ) 0 6 0 . 8 1 ( * * * 8 7 4 . 3 7 4 7 8 . 3 8 6 - ) 0 6 8 . 1 ( * * * 2 6 4 . 6 - ) 1 3 0 . 1 ( ) 7 2 3 . 0 ( ) 0 7 0 . 1 ( 6 2 5 . 1 - 4 1 4 . 0 - 5 0 9 . 0 ) 4 5 1 . 0 ( ) 3 5 1 . 1 ( ) 3 2 0 . 0 ( 9 1 1 . 0 1 9 3 . 0 6 0 0 . 0 - ) 3 4 3 . 0 ( ) 2 7 3 . 0 ( ) 8 0 0 . 0 ( ) 4 0 5 . 0 ( 3 3 1 . 0 - 9 2 6 . 0 9 0 0 . 0 - 5 3 4 . 0 - ) 7 5 1 . 0 ( * * 6 4 3 . 0 - ) 4 1 6 . 1 ( ) 6 5 5 . 0 ( ) 3 8 4 . 0 ( ) 1 8 1 . 0 ( ) 9 4 2 . 0 ( ) 8 7 2 . 0 ( 3 3 4 . 0 9 5 5 . 0 - 1 7 1 . 0 4 9 0 . 0 * * 6 5 8 . 3 - 5 1 2 . 0 - ) 0 5 5 . 6 1 ( 6 2 4 . 8 4 * * 4 9 5 . 5 4 4 6 . 6 8 5 - ) 0 7 8 . 1 ( * * * 6 0 8 . 5 - ) 1 5 0 . 1 ( ) 0 3 3 . 0 ( ) 9 7 0 . 1 ( 1 3 5 . 1 - 3 4 3 . 0 - 3 8 5 . 0 ) 6 4 1 . 0 ( ) 1 7 1 . 1 ( ) 3 2 0 . 0 ( 0 7 0 . 0 9 9 5 . 0 4 1 0 . 0 - ) 6 4 3 . 0 ( ) 3 7 3 . 0 ( ) 8 0 0 . 0 ( ) 2 1 5 . 0 ( 2 3 2 . 0 - 1 8 4 . 0 1 1 0 . 0 - 4 7 4 . 0 - ) 9 5 1 . 0 ( * * 6 1 3 . 0 - ) 6 4 5 . 0 ( ) 7 8 4 . 0 ( ) 4 8 1 . 0 ( ) 3 5 2 . 0 ( ) 5 7 2 . 0 ( 2 9 0 . 0 2 1 4 . 0 - 6 5 1 . 0 6 5 0 . 0 4 7 3 . 0 - . d e t r o p e r t o n t u b d e d u l c n i e r a s e i m m u d t e k r a m y r a m i r p e v ﬁ d n a s e i m m u d y r t s u d n i o w t - y t n e w T . ) ( e d i s n i e r a s r o r r e d r a d n a t s ;

Speciﬁcally, higher CSR cash pay leads to a lower call abandonment rate and an improvement in meeting target times. Employee compensation appears to have a positive inﬂuence on workforce perfor- mance, although the effects are not strong enough to yield signiﬁcant differ- ences in workforce performance between in-house and outsourced call centres. 5. Discussion and conclusion Our study expands the understanding of the signiﬁcant disparity in cash pay between in-house and outsourced organizations. Several new insights about compensation management in outsourced organizations emerge from our study. First, we ﬁnd that the inﬂuence of outsourcing status on compensation is similar for CSRs and managers. Organizations may try to maintain inter- nal equity so that CSRs and managers in outsourced call centres are consis- tently compensated in terms of their relative positions to occupational labour market pay rates. Second, we compared the value of beneﬁts earned by in-house and out- sourced CSRs. In contrast to our ﬁndings about cash pay, we found that in-house CSRs were not compensated with a greater value in beneﬁts com- pared with their outsourced counterparts. This ﬁnding may be a function of the institutional context, and considering the same question in the USA or other countries might yield a different outcome. Third, we evaluated how compensation and other HRM practices interact with each other and found some support for the strategic HRM argument that the organizational context, outsourcing in this study, inﬂuences various HRM practices simultaneously. CSR cash pay is associated with several HRM practices. Controlling for other HRM practices besides pay, as well as other organization-level characteristics, enriches our understanding of the pay disparity. Fourth, we evaluated the implications of lower pay in outsourced call centres. Outsourced call centres experience higher CSR quit rates and absen- teeism as a result of lower pay. Compared with quit rates, the ability of cash pay to account for the difference in absenteeism between these two types of call centres is relatively weaker. This ﬁnding may be the result of a range restriction problem because our sample consisted of call centres with lower absenteeism. Alternatively, in low-wage occupations, employees may proceed more quickly to other permanent forms of employee withdrawal such as quitting compared with high-wage occupations where employees can afford to be absent and quitting could be more costly because fewer alterna- tive positions are available. Fifth, CSR cash pay is signiﬁcantly related to workforce performance; however, the pay disparity between in-house and outsourced call centres is © Blackwell Publishing Ltd/London School of Economics 2010. s20 British Journal of Industrial Relations not ultimately associated with differences in workforce performance. Out- sourced call centres may use mechanisms that mitigate the effects of negative outcomes caused by lower pay (e.g. higher quit rates and higher absenteeism) on workforce performance. Our unreported ad hoc analysis shows that neither CSR quit rates nor CSR absenteeism is associated with workforce performance. These ﬁndings suggest that higher quit rates and absenteeism in outsourced call centres do not culminate in lower workforce performance. Hence, outsourced call centres may adopt practices that enable them to effectively handle the workforce churn. This view is consistent with the conﬁgurational approach (Delery and Doty 1996), which argues that there are multiple optimal HR systems that allow organizations to achieve improved performance. Clearly, more in-depth studies on the relationship between HR systems and workforce performance in outsourced organiza- tions are needed. Given the connection to the Global Call Centre Project, we can place these ﬁndings in a broader context. Extant studies typically examine global out- sourcing with service work being outsourced from developed countries (e.g. USA) to low-wage countries (e.g. India) (Batt et al. 2005). By contrast, this study examined pay disparity within a country and found that domestic outsourcing is also associated with lower pay, less high-involvement HRM and higher employee withdrawal. Indeed, evidence of a wage premium for CSRs employed in in-house call centres when compared with outsourced call centres in 15 countries is a consistent ﬁnding with three exceptions: Israel, the UK and India (Batt and Nohara 2009). The magnitude of this wage premium varies across the countries participating in the study (Batt and Nohara 2009). Along with outsourcing status, each country’s unique institutional setting also serves as a context that affects outsourced call centres’ compensation decisions. This study has several limitations. First, our analysis relied on a single respondent, which could introduce possible systematic and unsystematic biases (Gerhart et al. 2000a,b). We used techniques to reduce measurement errors, yet having multiple respondents for each establishment would increase the reliability of our data. Second, cross-sectional data and using call centres that have already decided whether to retain customer service in-house or outsource it altogether limits the claims we can make about causality. Third, our study relied on data from call centres, and replicating these results with other industries would strengthen our argument. This study provides valuable insights about the difference in compensation management between in-house and outsourced service organizations for employees and managers. The unique outsourcing context plays a key role in the determination of compensation systems. Outsourcing status has been typically captured as a consequence of organizational strategic decisions, but, as shown by this study, it has important implications for management practices.
