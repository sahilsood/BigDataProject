We revisit this relation by testing competing predictions from eco- nomics based and socio-political theories of voluntary disclosure using a more rigorous research design. In particular, we improve on the prior literature by focusing on purely discretionary environmental disclosures and by developing a content analysis index based on the Global Reporting Initiative sustainability reporting guidelines to assess the extent of discretionary disclosures in environmental and social responsibility reports. This index better cap- tures ﬁrm disclosures related to its commitment to protect the environment than the indices employed by prior studies. Using a sample of 191 ﬁrms from the ﬁve most polluting industries in the US, we ﬁnd a positive association between environmental performance and the level of discretionary environmental disclosures. The result is consistent with the predictions of the economics disclosure theory but inconsistent with the negative association predicted by socio-political theories. Nevertheless, we show that socio-political theories explain patterns in the data (‘‘legitimization’’) that cannot be explained by economics disclosure theories. Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

An unresolved research issue in environmental accounting is the empirical association between the level (i.e., amount) of corporate environmental disclosures and corporate environmental perfor- mance (Al-Tuwaijri, Christensen, & Hughes, 0361-3682/$ - see front matter Ó 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Clarkson et al. / Accounting, Organizations and Society xxx (2007) xxx–xxx 2004; Hughes, Anderson, & Golden, 2001; Patten, 2002). Accounting standard setters and securities regulators are increasingly being made aware of deﬁciencies in corporate environmental disclosures (Beets & Souther, 1999; Chan-Fishel, 2002; Franco, 2001). The results of previous studies on the relation between corporate environmental per- formance and environmental disclosure in ﬁnan- cial reports have been mixed. Patten (2002) attributes the failure to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant and con- sistent relation between environmental perfor- mance and environmental disclosure to problems in the research designs of existing research. These problems include failure to control for other fac- tors associated with the level of environmental disclosure, inadequate sample selection, and inad- equate measures of environmental performance and disclosure. This study seeks to revisit the relation between environmental performance and the level of envi- ronmental disclosure using a more rigorous research design. We test two competing predic- tions about the level of voluntary environmental disclosures. Voluntary disclosure theory (Dye, 1985; Verrecchia, 1983) predicts a positive associa- tion between environmental performance and the level of discretionary environmental disclosure. The notion is that superior environmental per- formers will convey their ‘‘type’’ by pointing to objective environmental performance indicators which are diﬃcult to mimic by inferior type ﬁrms. Inferior performers will choose to disclose less or to be ‘‘silent’’ on their environmental performance, thus being placed in a pool of ﬁrms where inves- tors and other users ascribe the ‘‘average type’’ to that pool. What sustains this partial disclosure equilibrium is proprietary costs associated with disclosure about environmental performance (Ver- recchia, 1983) and uncertainty as to whether the ﬁrm is informed regarding its type (Dye, 1985). Socio-political theories including political econ- omy, legitimacy theory, and stakeholder theory (Patten, 2002), on the other hand, predict a negative association between environmental performance and the level of discretionary environmental disclo- sures. These overlapping theories suggest that social disclosure is a function of social and political pressures facing the corporation. To the extent that poor environmental performers face more political and social pressures and threatened legitimacy, they will attempt to increase discretionary environ- mental disclosures to change stakeholder percep- tions about their actual performance. Thus, we have competing directional predictions from alter- native theories, and the observed direction of asso- ciation between environmental performance and the level of discretionary disclosures will eliminate one of the two predictions. The predictions of the above theories relate to discretionary, not mandatory, environmental dis- closures. Previous studies assessed environmental disclosures mainly from annual reports and other regulatory ﬁlings such as 10 Ks and many of those studies rely on a Wiseman (1982) based content analysis index to measure the extent of environ- mental disclosures. The Wiseman index focuses on the ﬁnancial consequences of corporate envi- ronmental activities and puts more weight on quantitative disclosures. Using this measure, poor environmental performers may actually have higher disclosure scores than good performers because they have greater exposures and must dis- cuss any material ﬁnancial information in their regulatory ﬁlings such as annual reports and 10 Ks. This may partially explain the inconclusive ﬁndings in the previous literature and why Patten (2002) ﬁnds a negative relation between environ- mental disclosure and a toxics release inventory (TRI) performance indicator.1 environmental based In collaboration with an environmental disclo- sure expert, we develop a content analysis index based on the global reporting initiative guidelines (GRI) to assess the level of discretionary environ- mental disclosures in environmental and social responsibility reports or similar disclosures pro- vided on the ﬁrm’s web site. This index diﬀers from Wiseman (1982) index, previously used in the liter- ature, because we focus on ﬁrm disclosures related to its commitment to protect the environment. Our index potentially allows investors, regulators, and 1 Patten (2002) was aware of the problem of non-discretion- ary disclosures in annual reports and dropped litigation disclosures as a partial attempt to deal with this (see p. 768).

This is valuable to users who seek to assess the ﬁrms’ true environmental commitment and related environmental exposures. We focus on the 2003 environmental disclosures of 191 ﬁrms drawn from ﬁve industries: Pulp and Paper, Chemicals, Oil and Gas, Metals and Min- ing, and Utilities. These ﬁve industries are consid- ered to have a high pollution propensity and have collectively been the subject of a whole range of environmental regulations in the US in the past 30 or more years. The magnitude of the environ- mental spending by these industries to comply with the environmental regulations and the impact of their operations on the natural environment should be a major concern to investors and other environmental stakeholder groups. Thus, ﬁrms in these industries collectively form an ideal sample to test the competing predictions of voluntary dis- closure and socio-political theories. In brief, our results are as follows. We ﬁnd a positive association between environmental per- formance and the level of discretionary disclosures in environmental and social reports or related web disclosures. In other words, superior environmen- tal performers are more forthcoming in truly dis- cretionary disclosure channels, as predicted by the economics based voluntary disclosure theory. Our result is inconsistent with the prediction of a negative association arising from socio-political theories such as legitimacy theory and stakeholder theory. Further, using the Janis–Fadner coeﬃcient of imbalance as a direct measure of perceived legit- imacy, we fail to observe the negative association between legitimacy and the level of disclosures theories.2 Thus, our implied by socio-political results suggest theories are not robust in predicting the level of discretionary environmental disclosures. that socio-political We do, however, ﬁnd that socio-political theo- ries are helpful in predicting what is being said, which moves the focus of enquiry beyond the sim- ple level of discretionary disclosure. Using the ratio of soft disclosure scores to total awarded scores as a proxy for ‘‘legitimization’’, we show that ﬁrms with unfavorable prior year media cov- erage are more likely to make soft claims to be committed to the environment which are not read- ily veriﬁable. This behavior is not predicted by theories, which assume economic disclosure truth-telling. Thus, theories do indeed explain additional patterns in the data. socio-political The paper is organized as follows. Following lit- erature review and hypothesis development, we describes our content analysis disclosure index and the measures of environmental performance which we use in the study. We then present our econometric model and preliminary empirical evi- dence. The sections ‘Empirical results involving the level of disclosure’ and ‘A revised role for socio-political theories’ contain the main results followed by sensitivity analysis. The ﬁnal section summarizes the main ﬁndings of the study with a discussion of implications for future research. Literature review and hypothesis development Literature review The existing in literature environmental accounting research can be categorized into three broad groups. The ﬁrst group of studies examines the valuation relevance of corporate environmen- tal performance information and has found that such information is valuable to investors seeking to assess environmental liabilities in diﬀerent set- tings.3 The second line of literature examines fac- tors aﬀecting managerial decisions to disclose potential environmental liabilities. This group of studies ﬁnds that there are strategic factors aﬀect- ing ﬁrms’ decisions to disclose environmental liability information, especially when disclosures 2 The Janis–Fadner coeﬃcient of imbalance measures the propensity of a ﬁrm’s prior year press articles pertaining to the environment to be unfavorable.

The study was concerned with a lack of corporate social responsibility disclosures in annual reports due to their voluntary nature. The authors scored environmental disclosures in 20 pre-selected content categories along four dimen- sions; evidence, speciﬁcity, and theme. Ingram and Frazier (1980) proxied environmental performance by a performance index devised by the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP), a non-proﬁt organization specializing in the analy- sis of corporate social activities. Forty ﬁrms were selected from the 50 ﬁrms that were moni- tored by the CEP. Regression results indicated no association between environmental disclosure and environmental performance, consistent with authors’ prior expectation about an overall poor quality of environmental disclosures in annual reports. Wiseman (1982) examines the extent of volun- tary environmental disclosures made by corpora- tions in their annual reports using a research design almost identical to Ingram and Frazier (1980). The study focuses on the 26 largest US companies that were monitored by the CEP for the 1972–1976 period. Wiseman designed an envi- ronmental disclosure index covering 18 items in four categories: economic factors (5 items), envi- ronmental litigation (2 items), pollution abatement activities (5 items), and environmental disclosures that do not fall into the other three (6 items). In addition, Wiseman assigned a score to each item based on whether the disclosure is quantitative or qualitative (3 for quantitative disclosure, 2 for non-quantitative disclosure, 1 for mentioning in general terms, 0 for no disclosure).5 The CEP 4 See Patten (1992), Li, Richardson, and Thornton (1997), Barth, McNichols, and Wilson (1997), Li and McConomy (1999), & Aerts, Cormier, and Magnan (2006). rankings were used as a proxy for environmental performance. Spearman rank order correlation indicates that there is no signiﬁcant association between the CEP environmental performance rankings and the Wiseman environmental disclo- sure index rankings. Freedman and Wasley (1990) examine the rela- tionship between corporate pollution performance and pollution disclosures made in annual reports and 10 K reports ﬁled with the SEC. Their sample consists of 50 US companies in four industries (Steel, Oil, Pulp and Paper, Electric Utilities). Again, the CEP rankings are used as a proxy for environmental performance. The authors measure environmental disclosures in both annual and 10 K reports using the same indexing procedure developed by Wiseman (1982). Spearman rank order correlation tests are conducted to examine the associations both between annual report dis- closure indices and the CEP indices, and between 10 K disclosure indices and the CEP indices. The results indicate that neither annual report environ- mental disclosures nor the 10 K environmental disclosures are indicative of ﬁrms’ actual environ- mental performance. Bewley and Li (2000) examine factors associ- ated with the environmental disclosures in Canada from a voluntary disclosure theory perspective. The authors measure environmental disclosures by 188 Canadian manufacturing ﬁrms in their 1993 annual reports using the Wiseman index. A ﬁrm’s pollution propensity (i.e., environmental performance) is proxied by their industry member- ship and by whether they report to the Ministry of Environment under the National Pollution Release Inventory program. The study ﬁnds that ﬁrms with more news media coverage of their envi- ronmental exposure, higher pollution propensity, and more political exposure are more likely to dis- 5 Many environmental disclosure studies since then rely on the Wiseman index in order to measure the extent of corporate environmental disclosures. Few recognize the fact that the Wiseman index places a heavy weight on the ﬁnancial conse- quences of corporate environmental activities, most of which are required disclosures in 10 Ks for public companies regis- tered with the SEC.

Hughes et al. (2001) examine environmental dis- closures made by 51 US manufacturing ﬁrms for 1992 and 1993. Again, the authors use a slightly modiﬁed Wiseman index to measure environmen- tal disclosures made within the President’s letter, MD&A, and note section, and then assess whether environmental disclosures are consistent with envi- ronmental performance ratings (good, mixed, and poor) by the CEP. Although the study ﬁnds no dif- ference in environmental disclosures between good and mixed groups, ﬁrms rated as poor environ- mental performers by the CEP tend to make sub- stantially more environmental disclosures under the Wiseman disclosure index. The authors attri- bute this ﬁnding to increased scrutiny in 1992 and 1993 by the FASB and SEC with respect to environmental disclosures, which forces poor per- formers to make more disclosure as they are sub- ject to more remediation activities. (2) Patten (2002) identiﬁes three issues in the previ- ous studies in this area; (1) failure to control for other factors, inadequate sample selection; and (3) inadequate measures of environmental per- formance. Since the CEP only followed a small group of ﬁrms in only four industries, reliance on the CEP for sample selection may be problematic. In addition, the CEP did not use the same criteria and consistent methodology to assess corporate environmental performance in diﬀerent industries. To overcome this issue, Patten uses TRI data, nor- malized by sales, to proxy for environmental per- formance. Using a sample of 131 US ﬁrms from 24 diﬀerent industries, and a modiﬁed Wiseman index measure and line count of environmental disclosures in 1990 annual reports, Patten ﬁnds that TRI/sales are positively associated with both measures of environmental disclosures, suggesting a negative relation between environmental perfor- mance and environmental disclosures. More recently, Al-Tuwaijri et al. (2004) explore the relations among environmental disclosure, environmental performance and economic perfor- mance using a simultaneous equations approach. Similar to Patten (2002) and Al-Tuwaijri et al. (2004) use TRI based data to assess environmental performance. Speciﬁcally, they assess environmen- tal performance as the percentage of total waste generated that is recycled. The authors measure environmental disclosure using a content analysis in four categories (potential responsible parties’ designation, toxic waste, oil and chemical spills, and environmental ﬁnes and penalties). These dis- closures are largely non-discretionary, in contrast to the discretionary disclosures which we examine. They ﬁnd a positive association between environ- mental performance and environmental disclosure. In summary, the existing studies ﬁnd mixed results on the relation between environmental dis- closure and environmental performance. One rea- son for the inconclusive ﬁndings is due to the choice of non-discretionary disclosure channels and use of the Wiseman (1982) index. It is self evi- dent that, as environmental problems and expo- sures increase, non-discretionary disclosures in regulated channels such as annual reports and 10 Ks should increase. Thus, a negative associa- tion between environmental performance and con- tent analysis scores in annual reports and 10 Ks may be driven by non-discretionary disclosures. The disclosure theories reviewed in the next sec- tion, on the other hand, apply to discretionary dis- closures. Thus, inferences about the robustness of these theories are confounded when the disclosure media are formal channels like the annual report and the 10 K. Adding to this problem is the heavy weight the Wiseman index places on disclosures about the ﬁnancial consequences of environmental activities, whereas our index places more weight on disclosures that reveal true (but unobservable) environmental performance. By focusing exclu- sively on environmental and social responsibility reports or similar disclosures on ﬁrms’ web sites, locations where disclosures are purely discretion- ary, and with an index that aims at revealing per- formance ‘‘type’’, we enhance the reliability of inferences about the true direction of association between environmental performance and discre- tionary disclosure. Hypothesis development The voluntary disclosure literature suggests that to disclose ‘‘good companies have incentives Please cite this article in press as: Clarkson, P.

Clarkson et al. / Accounting, Organizations and Society xxx (2007) xxx–xxx news’’ to diﬀerentiate themselves from companies with ‘‘bad news’’ in order to avoid the adverse selection problem (Dye, 1985; Verrecchia, 1983). While these theories do not pertain to environmen- tal performance per se, they are applied to this set- ting by Bewley and Li (2000) and Li et al. (1997). Companies with superior environmental perfor- mance due to their proactive environmental strat- egy have incentives to inform investors and other stakeholders of their strategy by voluntarily dis- closing more environmental information. Put sim- ply, they seek to reveal their performance type, something not directly observable to investors and other stakeholders, through direct voluntary disclosures that cannot be easily mimicked by poor environmental performers. they potentially increase ﬁrm valuation since knowl- edgeable investors will infer that exposures and latent environmental liabilities are lower for good as opposed to poor environmental performers.6 Thus, voluntary disclosure theory predicts a positive association between environmental per- formance and the level of discretional environmen- tal disclosure. In doing so, Turning to the predictions of socio-political the- ories, Gray, Kouhy, and Lavers (1995) and Lindb- lom (1994) argue that companies whose social legitimacy is threatened have incentives to increase environmental disclosures to: (1) educate and inform relevant publics about (actual) changes in their performance, (2) change perceptions about their performance, (3) deﬂect attention from the issue of concern by highlighting other accomplish- ments, and (4) seek to change public expectations of their performance.7 According to Patten (2000, 2002), socio-political theories predict a negative 6 The assumption that environmental performance ‘‘type’’ is not readily observable to investors and other stakeholders is supported by the diﬃculties environmental researchers have had obtaining reliable measures of environmental performance that are comparable across companies in the same industry and across industries (see Al-Tuwaijri et al., 2004 & Ilinitch, Soderstrom, & Thomas, 1998). 7 Socio-political theories include political economy, legiti- macy theory and stakeholder theory (see Patten, 2002). We do not diﬀerentiate them in this study as they have the same prediction with respect to the relation between environmental performance and environmental disclosure. association between corporate environmental per- formance and level of discretional environmental disclosure. Thus, the two competing theories pro- vide opposite predictions on how environmental performance may aﬀect discretionary environmen- tal disclosure strategies. Our hypotheses now fol- low (stated in the alternate form): H1a: Environmental performance and the level of discretionary environmental disclosures are positively associated, as implied by econom- ics based voluntary disclosure theories. H1b: Environmental performance and the level of discretionary environmental disclosures are negatively associated, as implied by the socio-political theories. Research design Environmental performance indicators A key research design issue in this study is to develop a reliable proxy for a ﬁrm’s environmental performance. The diﬃculty in assessing environ- mental performance is well documented in the lit- erature (see, for example, Ilinitch et al., 1998). Since we seek to assess relative environmental per- formance in this study, we follow the existing liter- ature and develop our relative environmental performance proxy using the actual pollution dis- charge data from the US Environmental Protec- tion Agency’s (EPA) TRI database (King & Lenox, 2001). Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst aggregate the total toxic releases (in pounds) and the toxic waste treated or processed for each of our sample ﬁrms in 2003, as reported by the EPA in 2005 (EPA annually reports the data at the plant level, with a two year lag). To verify the accuracy of our aggregation procedure, we compared the TRI measures obtained at the ﬁrm level with those pro- vided by the Investor Responsibility Research Center in their proprietary database. We found that the diﬀerences were minor. Our ﬁrst measure is the total toxic waste that is treated, recycled or processed as a percentage of the total toxic waste generated by each ﬁrm (% recycled). This measure is similar to the one used Please cite this article in press as: Clarkson, P. M. et al., Revisiting the relation between environmental ..., Account- ing, Organizations and Society (2007), doi:10.1016/j.aos.2007.05.003 ARTICLE IN PRESS P.M. Clarkson et al. / Accounting, Organizations and Society xxx (2007) xxx–xxx 7 by Al-Tuwaijri et al. (2004). We supplement our analysis with an alternative measure, the ratio of TRI to total ﬁrm sales. This gives us pounds of toxic releases per thousand dollars of sales for each of our sample ﬁrms (TRI/sales). However, if ﬁrms are not homogenous in terms of production pro- cesses within one of our ﬁve industries (Pulp and Paper, Chemicals, Oil and Gas, Metals and Min- ing, and Utilities), such that TRI/Sales is not directly comparable across ﬁrms in that industry, the recycling measure reduces this noise and facil- itates pooling. Since industry pollution propensity diﬀers sig- niﬁcantly, we alternatively rank the above two measures within each industry. Thus, the %Recy- cled ranks and TRI/sales ranks are our proxies for a ﬁrm’s relative performance within its indus- try. Similar relative performance measures are also used in Clarkson et al. (2004). Environmental disclosure index As discussed in section ‘Literature review and hypothesis development’, from the economic the- ory perspective, superior environmental perfor- mance (EP) types are hypothesized to seek credible direct disclosures to reveal their (unob- servable) performance type. A crucial property of these disclosures is that they focus on objective, ‘‘hard’’ measures that cannot be easily mimicked by poor environmental performers. Thus, reliable inferences about theories like Verrecchia (1983) and Dye (1985) require a content analysis disclo- sure index that puts a heavy emphasis on objective measures of performance as opposed to soft (i.e., not easily veriﬁable) claims to be committed to the environment.8 As a simple example, consider a good and a poor EP type ﬁrm in the same indus- try. The good EP ﬁrm will voluntarily disclose objective measures of environmental impact (e.g., quantitative environmental performance indica- tors) and will benchmark its performance relative to the industry, something the poor EP ﬁrm will not want to do. Thus, the good EP ﬁrm will 8 For a related discussion on the need for objective and veriﬁable disclosures to achieve the separation predicted by Verrecchia (1983) see Hutton, Miller, and Skinner (2003). emphasize discretionary disclosures that are hard to mimic. We assume these hard disclosures are truthful, in that a ﬁrm would face litigation expo- sure if caught lying by informed stakeholders in social responsibility reports or web related disclosures.9 What is striking in all this is that there is a demand by environmental stakeholders for pre- cisely the same thing: hard, objective measures of environmental performance in social responsibility reports, so that poor EP performers cannot mimic good EP performers by soft, unveriﬁable claims to be committed to the environment. Indeed, good EP performers and environmental stakeholders have joined forces to develop standards for ﬁrms preparing social responsibility reports that put a premium on hard, objective measures. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) was launched in 1997 as a joint initiative of Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, a US non-government organization and the United Nations Environmental Program. The overall goal of the initiative is to develop a globally accepted reporting framework to enhance the quality, rigor, and utility of sustainability reporting (Global Reporting Initiative, 2002). The GRI Guidelines follow 11 principles (transparency, inclusiveness, auditability, completeness, relevance, sustainabil- ity context, accuracy, neutrality, comparability, clarity, and timeliness) to ensure that sustainability reports (1) present a reasonable and balanced account of economic, environmental, and social performance, (2) facilitate comparison over time and across organizations, and (3) credibly address issues of concerns to stakeholders. The ﬁrst set of GRI Guidelines was published in 1999 as an Expo- sure Draft and several revisions have followed since then. For the purpose of this study, we rely on the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines published in 2002. 9 As anecdotal evidence in support of this argument, Green- peace issued a press release on October 14, 1994 accusing MacMillan Bloedel of deliberately lying to the public by claiming that, in 25 years, the company had been convicted of only 15 environmental oﬀenses. Greenpeace identiﬁed 26 convictions in the last four years. Please cite this article in press as: Clarkson, P.

Clarkson et al. / Accounting, Organizations and Society xxx (2007) xxx–xxx We engaged an expert in the ﬁeld of environ- mental reporting to help us develop a content anal- ysis index suitable for ﬁrms’ sustainability reports or the corresponding sections of a broad social responsibility report or equivalent discussions on the web.10 From the outset, we agreed that the construct we seek to measure is the extent of a ﬁrm’s disclosure in their sustainability report. With this aim established, the expert convinced us that the GRI reporting guidelines are consistent with that purpose. Thus, the expert helped us develop a scoring model containing 95 line items that reﬂect the spirit of the GRI guidelines. Table 1 contains the scoring model with a reference to the corresponding section in the GRI guidelines. Our disclosure index follows closely the report- ing requirements of the GRI guidelines for the fol- lowing reasons. Firms do not have to prepare social responsibility reports or related web based disclosures discussing their environmental impacts, and if they voluntarily do so, they do not have to adopt the GRI guidelines. The voluntary decision by a ﬁrm to both prepare a social responsibility report and use the GRI guidelines means that the ﬁrm has opted for a format (the GRI format) that, by the intent of the GRI guidelines, will result in hard disclosures not easily mimicked by the poor EP types. Thus, a ﬁrm making a sincere attempt to use the GRI guidelines will score high using our content analysis index, which is precisely the result we seek (i.e., the poor EP types will not want to conform to GRI guidelines that place a pre- mium, for example, on objective environmental performance the 95 equally weighted items in our disclosure index, 79 relate to ‘‘hard’’ disclosure measures compared to only 16 for ‘‘soft’’ disclosure items, a proportion which (according to the expert who helped us developing the index) reﬂects the spirit of the GRI guidelines. indicators).

He is also a judge for the Canadian Institute for Chartered Accountants’ Corporate Reporting Awards. We now turn to discuss our disclosure index in more detail. Our disclosure index consists of seven broad categories, A1–A7, of environmental disclo- sures (see Table 1). We consider A1–A4 and A5– A7 to represent ‘‘hard’’ and ‘‘soft’’ environmental disclosures, respectively. To score environmental disclosures in discre- tionary channels and web related disclosures, we accessed the internet web site of each sample ﬁrm and identiﬁed its environmental report, if any, and any web based environmental disclosures. We saved all such disclosures as of September 2004. This arbitrary choice of timing worked out well for us as all ﬁrms discussed their ﬁscal 2003 environmental performance in the environmental reports and related web based disclosures which we obtained. Hard disclosure items Category A1 focuses on disclosures pertaining to a ﬁrm’s governance structure and management systems put in place with respect to environmental protection. For instance, ﬁrms whose Board of Directors have an environmental committee or have implemented ISO 14001 will inform their stakeholders of such commitments. A2 focuses on the credibility of a ﬁrm’s disclosures in its envi- ronmental report. Firms that obtained indepen- dent veriﬁcation of their environmental reports, and ﬁrms with their products and environmental programs certiﬁed by independent agencies and third parties will receive higher scores in this cate- gory. In A3, we assess the extent to which ﬁrms disclose speciﬁc environmental performance indi- cators, both about their actual pollution emissions and their conservation and recycling eﬀorts. These are the ‘‘hard’’ data that ﬁrms can disclose to con- vince stakeholders about their environmental com- mitments. In addition, we also award scores when ﬁrms disclose performance indicators with respect to historical trends, the ﬁrms’ own emission reduc- tion targets, and the industry average. Disclosing actual performance indicators in the above context can convey critical information for stakeholders to assess the ﬁrm’s long-term environmental perfor- mance (and commitments).

Index items are classiﬁed in two categories: ‘‘hard’’ and ‘‘soft’’ disclosures. The second column presents the mapping of items in the index to the Global Initiative Reporting (GRI) guidelines. The third column presents the percentage of ﬁrms which made disclosures on that item (discretionary channels considered are Environmental and/or Social Responsibility Reports, or similar disclosures in ﬁrms’ web site). Good environ- mental performance (EP) ﬁrms are ﬁrms that have the environmental performance measure (% recycled) above the industry median. The last two columns present the average score on each item for each group of ﬁrms. The signiﬁcance levels presented in the last column are from two-sample t-statistics that test the diﬀerence between the good and the poor group. ***, **, * represent signiﬁcance levels (two-tailed) at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively. Wilcoxon Rank tests and t-tests with Bootstrap Resampling provided similar results. Sample size is 122 ﬁrms. Please cite this article in press as: Clarkson, P.

Clarkson et al. / Accounting, Organizations and Society xxx (2007) xxx–xxx 11 Table 1 (continued) a The scoring scale of environmental performance data is from 0 to 6. A point is awarded for each of the following items: (1) Performance data is presented; (2) Performance data is presented relative to peers/rivals or industry; (3) Performance data is presented relative to previous periods (trend analysis); (4) Performance data is presented relative to targets; (5) Performance data is presented both in absolute and normalized form; (6) Performance data is presented at disaggregate level (i.e., plant, business unit, geographic segment). spending. We do not score disclosures pertaining to environmental spending as a result of comply- ing with the existing environmental regulations, as such disclosures are largely non-discretionary and appear in mandatory disclosure channels such as 10 Ks and annual reports. Rather, we focus on disclosures of dollar savings from existing environ- mental programs and eﬀorts and discretionary spending to further enhance future environmental performance such as investing in new environmen- tal technologies or environmentally related R&D and innovations. We also include disclosures of ﬁnes related to environmental issues. Such penal- ties are usually immaterial thus their reporting is not mandatory. Nevertheless, the dollar amount of ﬁnes is important to environmental stakehold- ers to assess the level of true commitment to the environment. In summary, our index design in the A1–A4 ‘‘hard’’ disclosure categories makes it relatively diﬃcult for poor environmental per- formers to mimic the environmental disclosures of good environmental performers. Soft disclosure items We measure a ﬁrm’s disclosures of vision and environmental strategy claims in A5. For instance, ﬁrms often disclose broadly that they have an envi- ronmental policy, that management is committed to protecting the environment, etc. Such disclo- sures can be genuine when put in the speciﬁc con- text but they can also be deceiving as they lack credibility and substantiation, and can be easily mimicked.11 A6 assesses the disclosure of a ﬁrm’s 11 Consider, for example, items A5-2, 3 and 5. We classify these statements as soft because they involve claims about environmental management control systems without details or substantiation. In contrast, the corresponding items in A1-1 and 2 are hard because they provide speciﬁc information about the existence of the department, management positions or board committees responsible for monitoring pollution control. environmental proﬁle given the existing and forth- coming environmental regulations. Finally, we code a ﬁrm’s disclosures of its environmental ini- tiatives in A7. Items coded here include employee training in environmental management, existence of response plans for environmental accidents, internal environmental awards and audit, and community involvement through scholarship and donations. Again, these kinds of initiatives can represent true commitment but they can also be imitated by companies with no real commitments to protecting the environment.

We perform a content analysis using our disclosure index (see Table 1). EP – is an environmental performance proxy. We use two alternative proxies to capture the envi- ronmental performance of each ﬁrm. The ﬁrst is the TRI emission scaled by total sales revenue. To facilitate the interpretation of the results, we reverse the sign of this variable. In other words, the larger this measure is, the better the environ- mental performance of the ﬁrm.

Both measures are computed using the public database made available by the US Envi- ronmental and Protection Agency (EPA). We aggregate the plant speciﬁc data at the ﬁrm level. J–F coeﬃcient – the Janis–Fadner coeﬃcient of imbalance, measured for the ﬁrm’s 2002 ﬁscal year and deﬁned in greater detail below. FIN – is the amount of debt or equity capital raised by the ﬁrm in the ﬁscal year 2004. It is the sale of common stock and preferred shares minus the purchase of common stock and preferred shares (#108–#115) plus long term debt issuance minus reduction (#111– #114).12 The amount is scaled by the size of total assets at the end of the ﬁscal year 2002. the long term debt TOBIN Q – is Tobin’s Q, measured as market value of common equity (#25 * #199) plus book value of preferred stock (#10), book value of long term debt (#9) and current liabilities (#5), divided by book value of total assets (#6). VOLAT – is stock price volatility, measured as standard deviation of market adjusted monthly stock return during ﬁscal year 2003. ROA – is total return on assets measured as the ratio of income before extraordinary items (#18) at the end of ﬁscal year 2004 and total assets (#6) at the end of ﬁscal year 2003. LEV – is the leverage ratio, measured as the ratio of total debt (#9 + #34) divided by total assets (#6) at the end of ﬁscal year 2003. SIZE – is the natural logarithm of the total asset value measured as of the end of ﬁscal year 2003. NEW – is the asset newness, measured as a ratio (#8) of net properties, plant and equipment divided by the gross properties, plant and equip- ment (#7) at the end of ﬁscal year 2003. CAPIN – is the capital intensity, measured as a ratio of capital spending (#128) divided by total sales revenues (#12) at the end of ﬁscal year 2003.

We include them to avoid a correlated omitted variables threat that EP is standing in for some other well known determi- nants of disclosure in other disclosure channels. We divide the control variables in three groups: variables that proxy for the beneﬁts of voluntary disclosures, variables that measure costs of volun- tary disclosures and other control variables. Beneﬁts of voluntary disclosure Financing: It is well known that ﬁrms that raise ﬁnancing in debt and equity markets have a higher propensity for disclosures in voluntary channels (Frankel, McNichols, & Wilson, 1995) to lower their cost of capital. We use the amount of debt and equity ﬁnancing raised by the ﬁrm in the ﬁscal year following the measurement of the environ- mental performance (FIN). Information asymmetry: It is generally asserted in the voluntary disclosure literature that manag- ers seek to lower information asymmetry through voluntary disclosures in order to lower the cost of capital (Healy & Palepu, 2001). Our chosen proxies for information asymmetry are: monthly stock return volatility measured (VOLAT) over the 12 month period represented by ﬁscal 2003 (Lim, 2001) and Tobin’s Q, based on the argument that ﬁrms with greater unbooked intangibles and a positive NPV investment opportunity set enjoy larger Tobin’s Q (Barth & Kasznik, 1999; Smith & Watts, 1992). Firm performance: Lang and Lundholm (1993) and others have shown that ﬁrms with superior upcoming earnings performance have a higher dis- closure propensity to reveal their ‘‘good news’’ to ﬁnancial markets. At the time of observing web disclosures (September 2004), markets would know ﬁscal year 2003 ROA so earnings for the upcoming year would be ﬁscal 2004 ROA. Leverage: A number of disclosure studies (e.g., Leftwich, Watts, & Zimmerman, 1981) have argued that the monitoring demand for informa- tion increases as ﬁrm debt increases, and empirical evidence is consistent with managers being more forthcoming, generally to facilitate the contracting Please cite this article in press as: Clarkson, P. M. et al., Revisiting the relation between environmental ..., Account- ing, Organizations and Society (2007), doi:10.1016/j.aos.2007.05.003 ARTICLE IN PRESS P.M. Clarkson et al. / Accounting, Organizations and Society xxx (2007) xxx–xxx 13 demand for information. Agency costs of debt are higher for ﬁrms with relatively more debt in their capital structure (Jensen & Meckling, 1976), thus voluntary disclosures are expected to increase with leverage. Costs of voluntary disclosures Firm Size: Most voluntary disclosure studies control for ﬁrm size (see, for example, Lang & Lundholm, 1993) based on the assumption of economies of scale with respect to information production costs.13 Proprietary costs: In Verrecchia (1983), a key friction sustaining a partial disclosure equilibrium is the existence of proprietary costs associated with being forthcoming. In our setting, proprietary costs pertain to the manager revealing information to environmental regulators and other environ- mental activist groups that increase the probability of criticism, sanction or attack (see Li et al., 1997). We assume that industry serves as a measure of proprietary costs, since pollution propensity and related monitoring by opponents is well known to vary by industry. In our inter-industry regres- sions, we control for industry ﬁxed eﬀects in order to control for diﬀering proprietary costs and other unidentiﬁed factors that might vary by industry. Other control variables speciﬁc to environmental disclosures Equipment age and annual capital spending: Healy and Palepu (2001) describe a common criti- cism in the voluntary disclosure literature involv- ing endogeneity. EP and sustainability disclosures might be joint endogenous variables driven by some underlying exogenous variables such as the 13 Firm size has been regularly established as a determinant of voluntary disclosure in the literature, so its eﬀects must be controlled for. Firm size is marginally signiﬁcant and positively correlated with % recycled in the Chemical and Pulp and Paper industries, but is insigniﬁcant for our other three industries. In Table 4, we control for ﬁrm size as a covariate to ensure that our EP measures are not standing in for size. In Table 5, ﬁrm size is once again a covariate in our model. Thus, the role played by ﬁrm size in environmental disclosure is controlled for in both tables when we isolate eﬀects due to EP. level of investments in clean technologies, thus rep- resenting a threat to causal inferences. Firms with newer, cleaner technologies are likely to have a superior environmental performance measure and it is reasonable to assume that they will want stakeholders to know about this superior environ- mental performance in discretionary disclosure channels. To address this threat, we control for the average age of a ﬁrm’s equipment (NEW) based on the argument that newer equipment is expected to employ newer and less polluting tech- nologies. For similar reasons, ﬁrms with higher sustaining capital expenditures, as proxied by CAPIN, are expected to have newer equipment and may want to signal their environmental type through more discretionary disclosures regarding their environmental performance. Favorable media coverage: Following Aerts and Cormier (2006), Bansal and Clelland (2004) and Janis et al. (1965), we measure lagged environmen- tal legitimacy as the propensity for unfavorable press articles using the Janis–Fadner coeﬃcient of imbalance. This coeﬃcient ranges from  1 (unfavorable) to +1 (favorable), with zero imply- ing neutral perceptions about the ﬁrm’s environ- mental legitimacy. Following Aerts and Cormier (2006) and Patten (2002), legitimacy theory pre- dicts a negative association between lagged envi- ronmental legitimacy and the level of voluntary environmental disclosures.14 The Janis–Fadner coeﬃcient is measured as follows: Janis–Fadner coefficient if e > c; if c > e; t2 ¼ ðe2   ecÞ ¼ ðec   e2Þ ¼ 0 t2 if e ¼ c; 14 In our sample of 191 ﬁrms, 126 have at least one article in Factiva database related to the environment in ﬁscal 2002. The 126 ﬁrms generate 770 total articles related to the environment during ﬁscal 2002. Of these, 393, 207, and 170 are coded by us as unfavorable, neutral and favorable, respectively. For the 65 ﬁrms with no environmental articles, the Janis–Fadner coeﬃ- cient is set to a default measure of zero. Thus, silence in the media is interpreted to imply neutrality of perceptions about environmental legitimacy. Please cite this article in press as: Clarkson, P.

Sample selection, summary statistics and univariate empirical results As mentioned in section ‘Introduction’, the sample of this study consists of public US compa- nies from ﬁve polluting industries that report toxic release data to the US Environmental Protection Agency and have ﬁnancial and stock price data in the Compustat and CRSP database.15 The ﬁnal sample contains 191 ﬁrms covered by the EPA- TRI database for 2003 with adequate variables available in Compustat and CRSP. The distribu- tion across the ﬁve industries is as follows: 27 ﬁrms in the Pulp and Paper industry (14.14% of the sam- ple), 63 ﬁrms in the Chemical industry (32.98% of the sample), 18 ﬁrms in the Oil and Gas industry (9.42% of the sample), 42 ﬁrms in the Metals and Mining industry (21.99% of the sample) and 41 ﬁrms in the Utilities industry (21.47% of the sam- ple). Among these ﬁrms, 122 ﬁrms (63.87% of the sample) chose to provide discretionary disclo- sures about the environment in ﬁscal 2003: 55 of those ﬁrms had stand alone environmental reports and invariably also had supplementary web disclo- sures, while the remaining 67 ﬁrms had discretion- ary web alone environmental reports. If a ﬁrm has no environ- mental report or related discretionary web disclo- sures, we classify such a ﬁrm as being ‘‘silent’’, with the disclosure score set to zero for these 69 ﬁrms.16 We allow silent ﬁrms in the sample since non-disclosure is a choice in a partial disclosure equilibrium setting. disclosures but no stand 15 We identify all ﬁrms with available TRI data and two-digit SIC codes: 26 (pulp and papers), 28 (chemicals), 29 (oil and gas), 33 (metals and mining), and 49 (utilities). For these companies, we read the ﬁrm’s business descriptions and dropped companies that identify material business operations in industries outside of their primary two-digit SIC code. 16 We contacted the 69 ﬁrms with zero disclosures ﬁrst by email and then by phone. None of them indicated that they published a stand alone environmental report in 2003. For ﬁrms providing discretionary environmen- tal disclosures, Table 1 presents our scoring model along with descriptive statistics as to the percent- age of ﬁrms disclosing a particular item and the diﬀerence in average disclosure scores across good and poor EP ﬁrms. The table also shows the GRI reference for each line item. A crucial assumption of our scoring approach is that the disclosures are discretionary. In support of that assumption, we use only disclosures that came from ﬁrm environ- mental reports (hereafter EP reports) or web based disclosures other than ﬁrm annual reports or 10 Ks. We assume that EP reports/web disclosures are purely discretionary, i.e., silence is always an option. In Table 1, A1–A4 summarize the separation in average awarded scores across good and poor EP performers, using the %Recycled as the measure of environmental performance. We use the median % recycled in a given industry to classify ﬁrms as good versus poor EP performers.17 Recall that, according to H1a, good EP performers should have higher scores for hard disclosure items that are diﬃcult to mimic by poor EP performers. The results in Table 1 conﬁrm that prediction for the A1 category (Governance Structure and Man- agement Systems). The average score for good (poor) EP performers is 2.08 (1.27). Using a two- tailed t-test the diﬀerence is signiﬁcant at the 1% level. For the A2 category (Credibility), the aver- age score for good (poor) EP performers is 2.88 (1.95), and the diﬀerence is again signiﬁcant at the 5% level. Not surprisingly, good EP ﬁrms are more likely to disclose that they adopt GRI guide- lines. The diﬀerence in average scores 0.21 versus 0.03 is statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level. It is apparent from the scores for A2-2 that 2 (61 · 0.03) good EP ﬁrms obtained independent assurance for their ER report/web disclosures compared to zero poor EP ﬁrms. While this is con- sistent with an attempt by good EP ﬁrms to signal their type, the diﬀerence between the two types of ﬁrms is not statistically signiﬁcant. 17 Our results in Table 1 are qualitatively unaﬀected when we partitioned the sample using the mean % recycled.

M. et al., Revisiting the relation between environmental ..., Account- ing, Organizations and Society (2007), doi:10.1016/j.aos.2007.05.003 ARTICLE IN PRESS P.M. Clarkson et al. / Accounting, Organizations and Society xxx (2007) xxx–xxx 15 Of special interest is category A3 (EPI indica- tors), since this type of hard disclosure is not one that poor EP ﬁrms will want to mimic. The aver- age score for Good EP performers of 10.19 is well in excess of the corresponding average score for poor EP performers, 6.00 (the diﬀerence is signiﬁ- cant at the 1% level). Each item has a total score of 6 based on the dimensions indicated in Table 1. The low scores for both good and poor EP per- formers suggest that disclosures in this area are less than ideal given the GRI guidelines. In unta- bulated analyses, we analyzed the contribution of each of the 6 dimensions to the total scores (i.e., ‘‘hits’’) awarded in A3, for good versus poor EP ﬁrms: performance data presented represents 43.50% (48.44%) of total A3 scores awarded for good (poor) EP ﬁrms, respectively; performance data presented relative to peers represents only 1.06% (2.44%) of total A3 scores awarded for good (poor) EP ﬁrms, respectively; trend analysis repre- sents 28.86% (26.33%) of total A3 scores awarded for good (poor) EP ﬁrms, respectively; perfor- mance 8.76% (7.31%) of total A3 scores awarded, for good (poor) EP ﬁrms, respectively; performance data presented in both absolute and normalized form represents 7.87% (8.63%) of total A3 scores awarded, for good (poor) EP ﬁrms, respectively; and, ﬁnally, performance data presented at the disaggregated level represents 9.64% (6.68%) of total A3 scores awarded, for good (poor) EP ﬁrms, respectively. Thus, it is apparent that GRI guide- lines with respect to performance relative to peers are not being followed by either good or poor EP performers. This is not surprising, as it is diﬃcult for both types of ﬁrms to decide on appropriate ‘‘peers’’ given diﬀerences in production processes across ﬁrms within a given industry. It is precisely this dilemma that makes relative environmental performance ‘‘unobservable’’ to the typical inves- tor or stakeholder, creating the potential for the setting of a partial disclosure equilibrium where some ﬁrms are more transparent than others in their report/web disclosures, and some ﬁrms are entirely silent. to targets relative represents The ﬁnal hard category is A4 (disclosures per- taining to discretionary environmental spending). For that category, the average score for good (poor) EP performers is 0.84 (0.45). The diﬀerence between the good and poor groups is signiﬁcant at 5%. In this category we ﬁnd that, on average, good EP ﬁrms disclose signiﬁcantly more often amounts spent on ﬁnes than the poor ﬁrms. Economics based voluntary disclosure theories predict that good EP ﬁrms will be more forthcoming about the dollar amount spent on ﬁnes because this amount will be lower than the corresponding amount for poor EP ﬁrms, consistent with supe- rior environmental performance within the indus- try. To validate that disclosing the amount spent on ﬁnes signals a ﬁrm’s commitment to the envi- ronment, we examine the dollar amount spent on ﬁnes and the number of environmental violations in ﬁscal year 2000 for the 100 of our sample ﬁrms (56 good EP ﬁrms and 44 poor EP ﬁrms) covered in the Corporate Environmental Proﬁle Database developed by the Investor Responsibility and Research Center. In untabulated results, we ﬁnd that the ﬁfty-six good EP ﬁrms had an average of 1.13 violations per ﬁrm and 0.17 cents of ﬁnes per thousand of dollars of sales. In comparison, the forty four poor EP ﬁrms had an average of 2.63 violations per ﬁrm and 0.42 cents of ﬁnes per thousand dollars of sales. Using a two-tailed t-test, the diﬀerence in the number of violations (scaled dollar ﬁnes) between the two groups is sta- tistically signiﬁcant at 0.02 (0.01) level.18 Table 1 contains corresponding statistics for the soft disclosure categories A5–A7. Consistent with H1a, good EP performers have signiﬁcantly greater soft discretionary disclosures for A7 (envi- ronmental initiatives) relative to poor EP perform- ers. However, there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence for A5 (vision and strategy) and A6 (environmental proﬁle). Overall, the results for our soft disclosure scores suggest less separation between good and poor EP ﬁrms, a ﬁnding which we explore in more depth in section ‘A revised role for socio-polittical theories’ below. 18 An alternative interpretation of our results for ﬁnes disclo- sures is that the ﬁrms disclosing such ﬁnes are seeking to legitimize the violation of environmental regulation and requirements. This pattern of disclosure behaviour is predicted by legitimacy theory (Patten, 2000). We leave the validation of this alternative explanation to future research.

Clarkson et al. / Accounting, Organizations and Society xxx (2007) xxx–xxx In Table 2, Panel A we present descriptive sta- tistics on environmental disclosure scores by industry. The lowest average score (out of 95) is 10.08 and is obtained by the Metals and Mining Industry while the highest score, 25.21, is obtained by the Pulp and Paper Industry.19 In Table 2, Panel B we show that the average ratios of TRI/ Sales for Pulp and Paper and Metals and Mining are 2.34 (i.e., 2.34 pounds of toxic emissions per thousand dollar sales) and 1.72, respectively. Thus, it appears that industries with a high (low) pollu- tion propensity are more (less) likely to provide discretionary environmental disclosures to ﬁrm stakeholders. This is by no means inconsistent with H1a which conditions disclosure predictions by environmental type at the ﬁrm level relative to industry peers. Table 2 does conﬁrm diﬀerences across sectors in both environmental disclosure and pollution propensities suggesting the need for industry controls. Untabulated analysis for our 69 ﬁrms with zero disclosure scores indicates that these ﬁrms have an average TRI/Sales (% recycled) measure of 2.97 (59.01%) compared to 1.82 (65.61%) for the 122 ﬁrms with non-zero disclosure scores. The diﬀer- ences in both EP measures across the two groups are signiﬁcant at the 5% level. This is generally consistent with H1a, i.e., poor EP ﬁrms are more likely to opt for silence. In Table 3, Panel A we present descriptive sta- tistics for independent variables used in the estima- tion. The average ﬁrm has a negative ﬁnancing variable (FIN) meaning that it reduces debt or repurchases shares more than it raises new ﬁnanc- ing. Also, on average, the ROA is about 5% and the average leverage (LEV) is 33% of total assets. 19 While our scoring scheme has 95 available points to allow for rich variety of disclosures from one sustainability report to the next, and from one industry to another, the attainable score is lower than this, even for an excellent sustainability report. For example, our top scoring ﬁrm, Weyerhaeuser, obtained 68 of the 95 available points, suggesting an eﬀective maximum of 71%. This is comparable to the eﬀective maximum in similar scoring scheme used in ‘‘Risk and Opportunity: the Best Practice in Non-ﬁnancial Reporting’’ by Standard and Poor’s (2004). Nonetheless, the low average scores (out of 95) for each of the four industries point to an overall need for improvement in sustainability reporting in the years beyond 2003. The ﬁrm size measured by the logarithm of total assets (SIZE) is 8.01 implying average total assets in dollar terms of $3.01 bn, thus our sample con- sists of relatively larger ﬁrms. The mean (and med- ian) ﬁrm size is comparable with the median ﬁrm size reported by Patten (2002) for his sample. The average J–F coeﬃcient is  0.08. We present in Panel B of Table 3 Pearson cor- relations between the independent variables used in the regressions. The Pearson correlation between the negative of TRI/Sales and % recycled is equal to 0.29 and is statistically signiﬁcant at 1%, implying that (minus) TRI/Sales and % recycled both measure environmental performance but the overlap is modest. Empirical results involving the level of disclosure Inter-industry analysis We present in Table 4 the results of inter-indus- try multivariate regressions of disclosure scores on the environmental performance measures and the control variables. We estimate the regressions using a Tobit analysis to account for the censoring of the dependent variable at zero.20 We estimate the Tobit regressions by maximum likelihood using a Newton–Raphson algorithm.21 We run three sets of equations based on the diﬀerent dis- closure scores (total, hard and soft) used on the dependent side. All regressions are inter-industry analyses using dummy variables to control for industry ﬁxed eﬀects. We estimate the regressions using each environmental performance variable separately and then include both variables at the same time. The ﬁrst three columns present the results for the total disclosure scores. As predicted by H1a, the estimated coeﬃcients for our environmental 20 As an alternative, we have re-run our regressions using simple OLS and the inferences are unchanged. 21 In the Tobit model, the marginal eﬀect of a change in an independent variable on the dependent variable (i.e., disclosure score) is the estimated coeﬃcient times the probability that the ﬁrm provides discretionary environmental disclosures (Verbeek, 2004).

This result is consis- tent with the discretionary disclosure theories of Verrecchia (1983) and Dye (1985), but inconsis- tent with the negative association (H1b) pre- dicted by socio-political theories.

The information asymmetry proxies (Tobin’s Q and stock volatility) are insigniﬁcant. Similarly, ﬁrm proﬁtability (ROA) in the following year is insigniﬁcant. One interpretation of this result is that ﬁrms resort to other disclosure channels to reduce the information asymmetry and convey their good news about future ROA, and do not use ER reports/web disclosures for this purpose. Turning to our agency proxy, we ﬁnd that the leverage variable is signiﬁcantly positive, suggest- ing that debtholders exercise pressure on ﬁrms to disclose environmental related matters to assess potential future liabilities. Also, large ﬁrms dis- close more, consistent with their lower information production costs. Similarly, ﬁrms with greater cap- ital expenditures disclose more: the coeﬃcient of the capital intensity control variable is signiﬁcantly positive. In contrast to our intuition, ﬁrms with newer equipment (NEW) are less likely to provide discretionary disclosures. The lagged Janis–Fadner coeﬃcient is not associated with the level of disclosure, which is consistent with the results of Aerts and Cormier (2006). environmental We also split our disclosure scores in two parts: hard disclosures and soft disclosures. Hard disclo- sures are closest in spirit to the assumed truthful disclosures in the voluntary disclosure theories dis- cussed in section ‘Literature review and hypothesis Please cite this article in press as: Clarkson, P. M. et al., Revisiting the relation between environmental ..., Account- ing, Organizations and Society (2007), doi:10.1016/j.aos.2007.05.003 ARTICLE IN PRESS 20 P.M. Clarkson et al. / Accounting, Organizations and Society xxx (2007) xxx–xxx development’. However, we ﬁnd similar results for both hard and soft disclosure scores: the estimated coeﬃcients for our two EP measures are positive and signiﬁcant for both hard and soft disclosures as predicted by H1a. Intra-industry analysis Following Lang and Lundholm (1993, 1996) and Healy et al. (1999) we supplement the above tests with an intra-industry approach which seeks to explain the within-industry variation in the ranks of disclosure scores using the within-indus- try variation in the ranks of our independent vari- ables. There are two reasons justifying this approach: (1) some of our variables (i.e., TRI/ Sales) can be compared within an industry but cannot be meaningfully compared across indus- tries due to diﬀerences in production processes; (2) the distribution of our disclosure scores for the Metal and Mining sector are quite low, so tak- ing intra-industry ranks and then pooling facili- tates the i.i.d assumption requirement of our OLS regression model.

Both (minus) TRI/Sales and % recycled complement each other and neither is redundant for the total sample or for the hard and soft groups considered separately. We ﬁnd similar results when we split the total scores into hard and soft disclosure scores: the esti- mated coeﬃcients for our two environmental per- formance measures are positive and signiﬁcant as predicted by H1a. The results for the control vari- ables are also generally comparable to Table 4. The Janis–Fadner coeﬃcient is now positively associated with the level of soft disclosures, which is opposite to the negative association predicted by the socio-political theories. A revised role for socio-political theories Overall, the results in the previous sections point to economic disclosure theory and not socio-political theory as being robust in predicting the level of discretionary environmental disclosure. If the focus of enquiry is switched to disclosure strategies, it may be that socio-political theories explain interesting patterns in the data. While we leave this possibility to future research, we oﬀer in this section some preliminary evidence on the question. Legitimacy theory predicts that ﬁrms with threatened legitimacy are likely to make self-serv- ing disclosures referred to as ‘‘legitimization’’ (see, for example, Adams, 2004; Gray et al., 1995, p. 54 & Hughes et al., 2001, p. 219). One example of legitimization is for a poor environ- mental performer to make soft claims to be com- mitted to the environment which are not readily veriﬁable. In fact, it is apparent from an inspection of Table 1 that many poor EP ﬁrms do make soft claims to be committed to the environment. Focus- ing on A5, Vision and Strategy Claims, over 90% of our poor EP ﬁrms make a claim which is awarded at least one mark in category A5. For example, 55 of 61 poor EP ﬁrms (i.e., 0.90 * 61) make a claim that is awarded a score of 1 for item A5-2 which is a statement of corporate environ- mental policy and/or commitment. Further, 33 of our 61 poor EP ﬁrms are awarded a score under A5-1 which involves a CEO statement on environ- mental performance to stakeholders.22 More formally, using the ratio of soft disclosure scores to total awarded scores as a proxy for legit- imization, we would expect to ﬁnd a negative rela- tion between prior perceived legitimacy and this ratio. Our tests based on the conditional sample of ﬁrms with scored sustainability/web disclosures appear in Table 6. We measure threats to legiti- macy in two ways: group EP membership based on the median % recycled and group media cover- age based on the median Janis–Fadner Coeﬃcient. There are 122 (95) ﬁrms with scored sustainability/ web disclosures (at least one environmental press article in 2002) and available EP. As indicated in Table 6, the ratio of soft/total scores is 50.95% for poor EP ﬁrms, compared to 34.23% for good EP ﬁrms. Similarly, the ratio of soft/total scores is 47.54% for unfavorable media coverage ﬁrms, compared to 32.58% for ﬁrms with favorable media coverage. In both instances, the diﬀerence is statistically signiﬁcant at the 1% level. Both results are consistent with ﬁrms whose environ- mental legitimacy is threatened to make soft claims to be committed to the environment. This result is predicted by legitimacy theory but cannot be explained by economic disclosure theories, which assume truth-telling and thus oﬀer no predictions about biased disclosures. These results hold when we repeat the tests (untabulated) in a multivariate fashion using all other control variables in Tables 4 and 5 and employ the ratio of soft/total as the dependent var- iable. There is a signiﬁcant negative association between the lagged Janis–Fadner Coeﬃcient and the ratio of soft/total scores, after including all control variables. Similar results hold for our two EP measures. This result is robust to the Tobit analysis approach (Table 4) and the rank regres- sion analyses approach (Table 5) and implies a greater propensity for ‘‘legitimization’’ behavior 22 As anecdotal evidence, consider the following soft environ- mental commitment claim made by one of our sample chemical ﬁrms in the bottom quartile of our environmental performance ranking: ‘‘Senior management leads the industry with respect to responsible care.’’ Please cite this article in press as: Clarkson, P.

Panel A presents diﬀerences in soft to total disclosure ratios across good environmental performance (EP) ﬁrms and poor environmental performance ﬁrms. Good environmental performance (EP) ﬁrms are ﬁrms that have the environmental performance measure (% recycled) above the industry median. Panel B presents diﬀerences in soft to total disclosure ratios across favorable media coverage ﬁrms and unfavorable media coverage ﬁrms. Firms with favorable media coverage are ﬁrms that have a Janis–Fadner Coeﬃcient above the sample median (see Bansal and Clelland, 2004 for details). Only ﬁrms that have at least one article in Factiva are included. The signiﬁcance levels presented in the last column are from two-sample t- statistics that test the diﬀerence between the groups. ***, **, * represent signiﬁcance levels (two-tailed) at 1%, 5% and 10%, respectively.

Non-parametric Wilcoxon rank tests are robust to the possibility that the data does not fol- low a normal distribution. In addition, we have bootstrapped the p-values of the two-sample para- metric t-tests by re-sampling the data with replace- ment.23 Both approaches result in the same levels of signiﬁcance as the ones reported for the para- metric t-tests. We verify whether the diﬀerence tests in disclo- sure scores reported in Table 1 are robust to the classiﬁcation of sample ﬁrms as good and poor 23 We implement the bootstrap procedure by drawing with replacement 20 000 samples from each EP group. Prior to resampling, the procedure mean-centers the data within each group (for details, see Westfall & Young, 1993). environmental performers, using the % recycled measure. We split the ﬁrms in the two groups based on the level of the alternative environmental performance measure, TRI/sales. We still ﬁnd sig- niﬁcant diﬀerences between the good and the poor groups across all main categories in the index. Finally, we run a Logit model to investigate whether the decision to provide any discretionary environmental disclosures is aﬀected by the envi- ronmental performance of the sample ﬁrms. We perform an inter-industry analysis using the same control variables as discussed in section ‘Econo- metric model’. Results (unreported) are consistent with the main results from Table 4. Environmen- tal performance is found to be one of the main drivers of the probability that the ﬁrm provides environmental disclosures in discretionary chan- nels. Precent recycled and (minus) TRI/Sales are signiﬁcantly positive at the 1% level when intro- duced separately. When both are in the model, the signiﬁcance level decreases to 10%. The J–F coeﬃcient is not signiﬁcant. All models show a good ﬁt (signiﬁcant likelihood ratios and almost 90% concordant observations) suggesting a good model speciﬁcation.

Clarkson et al. / Accounting, Organizations and Society xxx (2007) xxx–xxx 23 Conclusions Previous empirical evidence provides mixed results on the relationship between corporate envi- ronmental performance and the level of environ- mental disclosures. We revisit this relation by testing competing predictions from economics based and socio-political theories of voluntary dis- closure using a more rigorous research design. In particular, we improve the prior literature in two important ways. First, the predictions of voluntary disclosure theory relate to discretionary, not man- datory, environmental disclosures. This study focuses on purely voluntary disclosure media such as corporate Internet web sites and stand-alone environmental reports. Previous studies assessed environmental disclosures mainly from annual reports and other regulatory ﬁlings such as 10 Ks and many of those studies rely on a Wiseman (1982) based content analysis index to measure the extent of environmental disclosures. Second, in collaboration with an environmental reporting expert, we develop a content analysis index to assess the level of environmental disclo- sure in environmental and social responsibility reports or similar disclosures in the ﬁrm’s web site. The index, which follows closely the Global Reporting Initiative (2002) sustainability reporting guidelines, diﬀers from the Wiseman index in that we focus on ﬁrm disclosures related to its commit- ment to protect the environment. Our results are as follows. We ﬁnd a positive association between environmental performance and the level of discretionary disclosures in envi- ronmental and social reports or related web disclo- sures. In other words, superior environmental performers are more forthcoming in truly discre- tionary disclosure channels, as predicted by eco- nomics based voluntary disclosure theories. Our ﬁndings are robust to two reliable environmental performance measures that use actual toxic emis- sion and waste management data. The ﬁrst one is based on Toxics Release Inventory scaled by sales data at ﬁrm level (i.e., TRI normalized by ﬁrm’s operational scale) and the second one is percentage of total toxic wastes that were treated or processed by each ﬁrm. In addition, our ﬁndings are not aﬀected when we assess the relative environment performance within each industry in order to con- trol for industry diﬀerences in pollution propensity. Our results are inconsistent with the prediction of a negative association from socio-political theories, suggesting that these theories are not robust in pre- dicting the level of discretionary disclosure. Although there is separation in scores and good EP ﬁrms disclose more, the scores of good EP ﬁrms are low relative to the expectation implied by the 2002 GRI reporting guidelines and point to the need for improvement in the years beyond 2003. Speciﬁc areas where improvement is required include obtaining independent assurance of sus- tainability reports and the disclosure of environ- mental performance indicators. Finally, our results suggest important directions for future research. Speciﬁcally, we provide preli- minary evidence that socio-political theories are robust in predicting what is being said. In particu- lar, we ﬁnd that ﬁrms whose environmental legiti- macy is to be committed to the environment. This behavior is predicted by legitimacy theory but cannot be explained by economics disclosure theory. Thus, we argue that future environmental disclosure research should move the focus of enquiry beyond the level of disclosure. threatened make soft claims Acknowledgements We are grateful for comments and suggestions from the Editor (Anthony G.
