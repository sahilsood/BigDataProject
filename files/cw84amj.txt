Corporate  and  Social  Responsibility  Financial  Performance1  PHILIP  L.  COCHRAN  ROBERT A.  WOOD  Pennsylvania  State University  The relationship between corporate social responsibility  and financial performance is reexamined using a new  methodology, improved technique, and industry-specific  control groups. Average age of corporate assets is found  to be highly correlated with social responsibility ranking.  After controlling for  this factor, there still is some cor-  relation between corporate social responsibility andfinan-  cial performance.  The relationship between a firm's corporate social responsibility (CSR)-  or, more recently, its corporate social responsiveness-and its financial per-  formance has been the subject of a lively debate since the 1960s. Researchers  have reached no real consensus on the relationship between these variables.  In fact, a recent work reviewed seven earlier empirical studies and concluded  that "economic performance is not directly linked, in either a positive or  negative fashion, to social responsiveness" (Arlow & Gannon, 1982, p. 240).  Whether or not a relationship exists clearly is an important issue for cor-  porate management. If certain actions (classified as socially responsible)  tend to be negatively correlated with financial performance of firms, then  managers might be advised to be cautious in this area. If, on the other hand,  a positive relationship can be shown to exist, then management might be  encouraged to pursue such activities with increased vigor or to investigate  the underlying causes of this relationship. The focus of this paper is on  the question of whether these two factors (CSR and financial performance)  are related. Only once this question is answered can the question of causa-  tion be addressed.  This paper extends prior empirical research in three areas. Certain fac-  tors omitted in previous studies are explicitly controlled for by use of im-  proved financial performance measures and additional variables. A statistical  tool,  logit analysis, more suited to  the data is employed. Finally, the  'The authors would like to express their appreciation to Anthony  Curley, Keith Ord, Robert Pitts,  Steven Wartick, and three anonymous  referees for  their helpful  comments  and suggestions.  42  This content downloaded from 132.252.225.45 on Tue, 18 Nov 2014 14:43:12 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions 1984  Cochran and Wood  43  sample is enhanced by utilizing a large industry-specific control group and  using two test intervals.  Results of these improvements indicate the crucial role of firm assets in  test outcomes. Consequently, asset turnover and asset age are added as ex-  planatory variables. This expanded analysis reveals that the key correlate  with CSR is asset age and that the omission of this variable in previous  studies may have led to spurious positive correlations between CSR and  financial performance. Nonetheless, with this variable included, there still  is weak evidence of  a  positive correlation between CSR and financial  performance.  Previous  Research  Although the examination of previous research does, to a certain extent,  parallel the work of Arlow and Gannon, the number of studies examined  herein is considerably larger. In addition, this survey of earlier work pro-  vides the rationale for the bulk of this paper, namely, a new and considerably  more extensive empirical test of this research question.  Measurement of  Corporate Social Responsibility  There are two generally accepted methods of measuring CSR. The first  method is the reputation index. In this method knowledgeable observers  rate firms on the basis of one or more dimensions of social performance.  This method has some advantages. First, it tends to be internally consis-  tent because one evaluator is applying the same (albeit usually subjective)  criteria to each firm. Second, it makes no pretence of applying a rigorous  objective measure to a dimension that may be innately subjective. Third,  it may summarize the perceptions of a key constituency of various firms.  This alone may be an important factor in determining the relationship be-  tween CSR and financial performance.  There are, however, disadvantages as well. The most important (and most  obvious) is that such rankings are highly subjective and thus may vary sig-  nificantly from one observer to another. This raises the spectre of unreli-  ability. A second problem is one of sample size. Most reputation indexes  generated to date cover only a relatively small number of firms. Thus one  must be cautious about generalizing from the results of these studies.  The first reputation index was a fairly narrow one, generated by the Coun-  cil of Economic Priorities (CEP) in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In this  study the CEP ranked the pollution control performance of 24 firms in  the pulp and paper industry (Council of Economic Priorities, 1971). This  measure of  CSR has been used by a number of other studies, including  Bragdon and Marlin (1972), Folger and Nutt (1975), and Spicer (1978).  A second reputation index was generated by Milton Moskowitz, who over  a period of several years rated a number of firms as "outstanding," "honor-  able mention," or "worst" (Moskowitz, 1972, 1975). The 1972 version of  This content downloaded from 132.252.225.45 on Tue, 18 Nov 2014 14:43:12 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions 44  Academy of Management Journal  March  this index was used by Moskowitz and a composite of his 1972-1975 in-  dexes was used by Sturdivant and Ginter (1977) in their studies of the rela-  tionship between CSR and financial performance.  Another popular reputation index also can be traced back to Moskowitz.  A survey was conducted by the National Association of Concerned Busi-  ness Students ("How business school students rate corporations," 1972)  in which 300 graduate students of business administration were questioned  about their views on the social responsibility of some of the Fortune 500  firms. Indexes generated by this study were used subsequently by Vance  (1975), Heinze (1976), and Alexander and Buchholz (1978).  The second method of  measuring CSR is content analysis. Normally,  in content analysis the extent of the reporting of CSR activities in various  firm publications and especially in the annual report is measured. This can  consist of simply noting whether or not a particular item (such as pollu-  tion control) is discussed either qualitatively or numerically, or it can mean  actually counting a number of items. A commonly used source for content  analysis is a series of studies conducted by Beresford (1973, 1975, 1976).  Content analysis has two significant advantages. First, once the particu-  lar variables have been chosen (a subjective process), the procedure is rea-  sonably objective. Therefore the results are independent of the particular  research. Second, because this technique is more mechanical, larger sam-  ple sizes are possible.  However, content analysis also has some drawbacks. The choice of vari-  ables to measure is subjective. Further, content analysis is only an indica-  tion of what firms say they are doing, and this may be very different from  what they actually are doing. At best, one certainly could postulate that  firms that are aware of these issues are those that will discuss them as well  as act on them. On the other hand, one could imagine that firms that are  doing poorly on this front would feel an extra incentive to make themselves  look good by touting their achievements in their annual reports.  The first study to use content analysis was Bowman and Haire (1975).  In this study the authors examined only the food processing industry and  developed their own index based on the number of lines of the annual report  devoted to CSR. Subsequently, several other studies (Abbott & Monsen,  1979; Anderson & Frankle, 1980; Ingram, 1978; Preston, 1978) used con-  tent analysis indexes based on Beresford's work.  Neither content analysis nor reputation indexes can be considered wholly  adequate measures of CSR. The problem of measuring social responsibil-  ity or responsiveness of firms needs considerably more attention in this lit-  erature. Yet,  at  the moment there obviously are not  better measures  available.  Measurement of  Financial Performance  Although  one  might  have  expected a  certain diversity of  measures of  CSR,  there  is  no  real  consensus  on  the  proper  measure  of  financial  This content downloaded from 132.252.225.45 on Tue, 18 Nov 2014 14:43:12 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions 1984  Cochran and  Wood  45  performance either. In fact, there is a wide range of such measures. How-  ever, most measures of financial performance fall into two broad categories:  investor returns and accounting returns. Both have enjoyed periods of pop-  ularity, and both have evolved considerably over the course of the past  decade.  Investor Returns. The basic idea underlying investor returns is that returns  should be measured from the perspective of  the shareholders. The first  studies to employ investor returns as a measure of financial performance  were those of Moskowitz (1972) and Vance (1975). In both of these studies  changes in price per share was used as the investor returns index. As most  subsequent studies have noted, this measure is clearly flawed. The change  in price per share is only one element of investor returns. Dividend income  is the other, and it must be included in any measure of investor returns.  Abbott and Monsen (1979) used the change in share price plus dividends  as their measure of investor returns. However, this, too,  is insufficient.  Simple returns (change in price per share plus dividends) fail to capture  another dimension of vital importance to investors-namely,  risk.  In accepted finance theory, the risk of holding assets is measured by the  covariance of the expected return on the asset with that of the overall market.  This measure, which is commonly referred to as "beta," typically is ob-  tained for a stock by regressing its realized returns on those of  a broad  based market index. The regression slope coefficient provides the beta esti-  mate. An average beta is 1. A stock with a beta above 1 is considered an  aggressive stock because it will tend to move faster, either up or down,  than the market. Correspondingly, a stock with a beta below 1 is considered  a defensive stock (Curley & Bear, 1979).  It was precisely this failure to adjust for risk that led to the (apparently)  contradictory results of Moskowitz (1972) and of Vance (1975). Moskowitz's  study indicated that firms with high CSR ratings outperformed the market.  Vance, two years later, concluded just the opposite. An examination of  Moskowitz's high CSR firms over the 1970-1979 period indicates that the  portfolio of these firms had a beta of  1.56. The period that Moskowitz  examined, the first half of  1972, was a bull market (i.e., rising), and the  period that Vance looked at, 1972 through 1974, was a bear market (i.e.,  falling). Therefore, the apparent contradiction between their results can  be explained by the riskiness of the returns of the firms that they had clas-  sified as socially responsible and not by the variable they believed they were  examining.  Two studies did use risk adjusted measures of investor returns. These  were Alexander and Buchholz (1978) and Anderson and Frankle (1980).  However, there is a problem with the use of even a "clean" measure of  investor returns for this type of study. This problem is summarized by one  of the tenets of modern finance theory, the efficient markets hypothesis.  Simply stated, this tenet posits that as information that might affect future  cash flows of a firm becomes available, it immediately will be reflected in  its current share price. The implication of this is that even if CSR does lead  to improved financial performance, as soon as the market becomes aware  This content downloaded from 132.252.225.45 on Tue, 18 Nov 2014 14:43:12 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions 46  Academy of Management Journal  March  of any change in a firm's CSR rating it will immediately alter price per  share to reflect that information. As Alexander and Buchholz (1978) noted,  after this reaction only new information regarding a firm's social respon-  sibility will have any affect on the firm's financial performance. Thus, if  the perception of a firm's social responsibility changed in 1975 and a naive  researcher examined only the period 1977-1979, then he or she probably  would conclude that CSR and financial performance are unrelated. In order  to employ investor returns measures of  financial performance properly,  the researcher must conduct an "event study." Failure to do so could lead  the researcher incorrectly to the conclusion that there is no relationship be-  tween CSR and financial performance, even if one actually exists.  One particularly innovative methodology that avoids many of the earlier  problems with investor returns is employed by Ingram (1978). Ingram tests  for a correlation between social responsibility disclosures (used by others  as a proxy for CSR) and financial performance while controlling for both  risk and industry effects. The procedure may be viewed as a reverse cluster  analysis,  in  which  the  sample  is  iteratively  split  into  subgroups,  with  the  grouping criterion being maximization of the difference of a functional rela-  tionship between each of the two subgroups at each iteration. The func-  tional relationship that Ingram uses is excess market return for each firm  as the dependent variable; he uses fiscal year, excess accounting earnings,  and industry as explanatory variables.  Ingram's procedure divides his sample of  116 firms into 10 subgroups  wherein each subgroup has two sets of  firms-one  having higher excess  market returns than the other. In seven of these subgroupings, firms in  the higher excess market return category have better CSR ratings than do  those in the lower excess market return category. The reverse is true for  the remaining three subgroups.  Although this technique avoids many of the problems encountered by  earlier studies, one must be cautious in interpreting Ingram's results as sup-  port for a correlation between CSR and financial performance. If, in fact,  Ingram's null hypothesis, that is, that there is no relationship between social  responsibility disclosures and financial performance, were true, then 7 or  more of the 10 groups would have disclosure ratings in the higher finan-  cial performance categories with a frequency of 11.32 percent. This clear-  ly is not a strong rejection of the null hypothesis.  Accounting Returns. Accounting returns are the other primary method  of measuring financial performance. The basic idea behind using account-  ing returns as a measure of financial performance is to focus on how firm  earnings respond to different managerial policies. The most common mea-  sures of accounting returns used in studies of this question are simply earn-  ings per share (EPS) or price/earnings (P/E) ratios. Bragdon and Marlin  (1972), Bowman and Haire (1975), Folger and Nutt (1975), Heinze (1976),  Preston (1978), and Spicer (1978) all used EPS, P/E ratios, or some algebraic  variation of them as at least one of the measures of financial performance  in their studies.

Both are strongly influenced by the rate of growth  and accounting practices of firms (Beaver & Morse, 1978). In addition, these  financial performance measures cannot be accurately compared across firms  without considering financial leverage influences and risk differences. This  does not mean that one cannot use accounting returns, quite the opposite-  accounting returns may be the best proxy for financial performance. How-  ever, the particular measures used in previous studies have serious defects.  Samples in  Previous  Studies  Most of  the previous work in this area employed samples that were too  small to result in any safely generalizable results. The Folger and Nutt (1975)  study, for example, examined only nine firms. In fact,  6 of  the  14 studies  examined here had  samples of  less than  30  firms.  Second, the control groups in a number of these studies were too  small.  In several of the studies the small sample of CSR firms was segmented and  subgroups were compared. In others the sample was matched with an ex-  ternal control group of  similar size. All but four of  the studies employed  control  groups  smaller than  100 firms.  In order to overcome this problem, several researchers (Abbott & Monsen,  1979; Alexander & Buchholz, 1978; Moskowitz, 1972; Preston, 1978; Vance,  1975) compared their samples to broad market averages such as the Stan-  dard and Poors  500.  This  step represents an improvement,  but  compar-  ison to industry control groups is superior. Accounting  practices, operat-  ing leverage, and other variables that may influence test results will be more  homogeneous  within industries.  Sturdivant and Ginter (1977) recognized this problem and grouped their  sample into  four  somewhat  homogeneous  subgroups.  Unfortunately,  by  doing  so  they reduced their overall sample size and did not,  necessarily,  create subgroups with  sufficient  homogeneity.  Finally, the time period(s) employed in a number of the previous studies  was too  short.  Seven of  these studies employed time periods equal to  or  less than two years. Only five of the studies used time periods greater than  or equal to  five  years.  Results  of  Previous  Studies  As noted earlier, the previous empirical work in this area reached no real  consensus on the nature of the relationship between CSR and financial per-  formance. Of the 14 studies examined, fully 9 (Anderson & Frankle, 1980;  Bowman & Haire,  1975; Bragdon & Marlin,  1972; Heinze,  1976; Ingram,  1978; Moskowitz,  1972; Preston,  1978; Spicer, 1978; Sturdivant & Ginter,  1977) found some positive relationship between CSR and financial perfor-  mance. However, as noted earlier, because of incorrect specification of the  This content downloaded from 132.252.225.45 on Tue, 18 Nov 2014 14:43:12 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions 48  Academy of Management Journal  March  financial performance proxy, small sample size, and questionable meth-  odology, these results must be viewed with suspicion.  Three studies (Abbott & Monsen, 1979; Alexander & Buchholz, 1978;  Folger & Nutt, 1975) found no real link between these variables. Alexander  and Buchholz, as well as Abbott and Monsen, used forms of investor returns  as proxies for financial performance. Abbott and Monsen, however, failed  to account properly for risk. Alexander and Buchholz did properly account  for risk, but they did not employ an event study and thus could have failed  to discover a relationship even if one did exist.  One study (Vance, 1975) found a negative relationship between these vari-  ables. However, as discussed earlier, his proxy for investor returns (only  change in share price) clearly was insufficient.  Measures of  Social Responsibility  Method  As noted earlier, neither of the two major categories of CSR measures  (reputation indexes and content analyses) is wholly adequate. However,  because it has been used extensively in the literature on this subject, a specific  reputation index, the combined Moskowitz list (as used by Sturdivant and  Ginter), is employed by this study (see Table 1).  In order to avoid some of the problems of inadequate samples encoun-  tered in previous studies, each firm on this list is independently compared  to its industry group as defined by the four-digit Standard and Poor In-  dustry Codes.  The 61 firms (6 firms were eliminated because they no longer existed in  their original form) are contained in 42 such groups. Of these groups, 13  were eliminated either because there were insufficient data on the Compu-  stat tapes for calculating the three financial performance measures over  each of two five year periods (1970-1974, 1975-1979) or because there was  less than a total of 10 firms in the industry (thus making industry averages  suspect).  Therefore, in the first time period (1970-1974) the sample contained 39  firms in 29 industries, which were compared to 386 firms in their industry  control groups. In the second period (1975-1979) there were 36 firms in  28 industries and a total of  366 firms in the control groups.  Two time periods were studied to increase the sample size. Averaging  accounting data across five years will control for unusual accounting en-  tries in any one year that might distort test results.  Measures of Financial Performance  This study followed the precedent of most of the previous studies of this  question and used accounting data to measure financial performance. The  use of accounting data raises the possibility of distortions from inflation  This content downloaded from 132.252.225.45 on Tue, 18 Nov 2014 14:43:12 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions 1984  CSR  #a  Cochran and  Wood  Table  1  Firms in  Sample  49  Firm  SIC  #  Industry  1000  2  Amax,  Inc.  2111  3  American  Brands,  Inc.b  3410  3  American Can  Co.  2830  3  American  Home  Products  Corp.  4811  2  American Telephone  & Telegraph  2911  2  Atlantic  Richfield  Co.  3  Bethlehem Steel  Corp.  3310  2030  2  Campbell Soup  Co.b  2841  3  Colgate-Palmolive  Co.  5311  2  Dayton-Hudson  Corp.  2800  1  Dow  Chemical  2800  3  DuPont  (E.

These distortions were controlled for insofar as possible.  Three accounting returns measures were employed initially: (1) the ratio  of operating earnings to assets, (2) the ratio of operating earnings to sales,  and (3) excess market valuation. Each has certain strengths and weaknesses.  The ratio of operating earnings (as measured by operating earnings be-  fore depreciation, Compustat data item 13, less depreciation and amorti-  zation, Compustat data item 14) to assets measures the relative efficiency  of asset utilization. A major strength of this ratio is that it is free from  the effects of bias that can result from differences in capital structure be-  tween firms. However, it can be distorted by the effect of inflation on the  book value of the assets. For example, two firms may have identical physical  This content downloaded from 132.252.225.45 on Tue, 18 Nov 2014 14:43:12 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions 50  Academy of Management Journal  March  assets that they purchased at different times. If so, the book value of these  assets, in all likelihood, will be different, reflecting the effect of inflation  on nominal asset prices.  Further sources of distortion are depreciation, which is stated as a his-  torical rather than a current cost, and the impact of inflation on book in-  ventory values. Comparing sample firms against others in their industry  will partially control for these distortions.  The ratio of operating earnings to sales, though free from leverage dif-  ferences, also is subject to inflation distortion of depreciation. However,  it too has a serious weakness-it  fails to capture the relative effectiveness  of the use of assets by competitors.  The third measure of  financial performance employed in this study is  excess value (EV). This is a relatively new measure in the finance literature,  used by Thomadakis (1977) and Errunza and Senbet (1981). Excess value  is defined as the difference between total firm market value (market value  of equity and book value of debt) and the book value of assets, normal-  ized by sales or, in the absence of wealth transfers of the agency tradition:  Market Value of Equity and Book Value of  Debt -  Total Assets  Sales  This measure captures the value premiums or discounts accorded by the  market to various companies. Thus if CSR is correlated with superior or  inferior future prospects, then it will be correlated with EV. However, to  the extent that the inflation distortion of  asset values and income (and  thereby retained earnings) vary across firms, a potential for bias exists. An  advantage of this measure is that it reflects the market's evaluation of each  firm.  Empirical Results  Initial Analysis. The initial analysis phase of this study basically repli-  cates earlier work in this area by evaluating the relationship between CSR  and financial performance through analysis of covariance. The three finan-  cial performance measures for each firm are (separately) regressed upon  industry dummy variables and dummy variables for the Moskowitz CSR  categories with the constant term omitted. Specifically, the three regres-  sion models tested for each interval were:  FPi =bjCSRj +bkINDk +  ,  i=  1,  2,  3  where FPi are the averaged financial performance measures described  above for each firm, CSRj are 0,  1 dummy variables reflecting the Mos-  kowitz categories, INDk are 0,  1 dummy variables reflecting industry.  Recall that 29 industries were included in the first test interval and 28 in  This content downloaded from 132.252.225.45 on Tue, 18 Nov 2014 14:43:12 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions 1984  Cochran and  Wood  51  the second. This regression can be considered an analysis of covariance that  tests for CSR effects while controlling for industry effects.  The purpose of this analysis is to examine if CSR is significantly corre-  lated with either superior or inferior financial performance within industry  groups. The results of these regressions are shown in Table 2.

This pattern is repeated for the excess value  measure, with a slight reversal between "worst" and "honorable mention"  categories in the 1975-1979 interval.  However, the pattern differs for the operating earnings/assets measure.  All statistical significance is lost, and "honorable mention" firms appear  slightly superior to "best" firms. This result, also found by Bowman and  Haire (1975), raises interesting questions concerning the nature of the assets,  or their use, by these firms. Why might this puzzling result occur? Pos-  sible explanations are differences in the effectiveness of the use of assets  or differences in asset age between the CSR groups.  Further Test Procedures. In order to explore further these influences,  two additional variables are introduced. Asset turnover, or the ratio of sales  to assets, is used to measure the effectiveness of the use of assets by firms.  This ratio is equal to the operating earnings to assets ratio divided by the  operating earnings to sales ratio. In addition, the ratio of net fixed assets  This content downloaded from 132.252.225.45 on Tue, 18 Nov 2014 14:43:12 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions 52  Academy  of  Management  Journal  March  to gross fixed assets is used to measure asset age. The newer a firm's assets,  the closer this ratio will be to unity. As a firm's assets age, this ratio will  approach zero.  When these new variables are regressed on the industry and CSR dum-  mies, it is obvious that the above suspicions are confirmed (Table 2). Asset  age and asset turnover are related with Moskowitz's CSR categories. In  particular, asset age is strongly and significantly negatively correlated with  the "worst" CSR firms. In addition, asset turnover is weakly correlated  to Moskowitz's ratings.  There are two possible explanations for these results. First, firms that  are more socially responsible may utilize their assets in a less efficient man-  ner. This explanation, however, clearly is not consistent with the evidence  regarding return on sales. A second explanation is that inflation has seriously  distorted reported asset values. The positive correlation of asset age and  CSR rankings support this explanation. Newer firms have higher CSR  ratings and higher reported asset values relative to their older competitors.  At this stage, four of the five variables employed appear to be significantly  related to CSR. The relative strength of each is not yet clear. Note that  EV has the highest t statistic and asset turnover has the highest coefficient  of multiple determination. Also, there is evidence of interactions between  the variables, so proxying may be occurring within each regression. There-  fore, the next step is to test simultaneously the association between CSR  and the various measures of  financial performance.  Logit Analysis. Another statistical technique, logit analysis, provides an  appropriate test procedure by which the underlying assumptions of the model  are met by the data. The apparent problem of multicollinearity is a factor  in considering which explanatory variables to include in the logit analysis.  Correlations between possible explanatory variables are shown in Table 3  for both test intervals. Operating earnings/asset and operating earnings/sales  have the highest correlations in both time periods. Because the latter vari-  able has a higher correlation with CSR, operating earnings/assets is ex-  cluded in the logit analysis. The remaining correlations indicate a possible  Table 3  Financial Variable Correlation  1970-1974,  1975-1979a  Operating  Earnings/  Assets  Operating  Earnings/  Sales  Asset  Age  Asset  Turnover  Excess  Value  1.000  (1.000)  .587  (.823)  .055  (.136)  .115  (.249)  .570  (.561)  1.000  (1.000)  .241  1.000  (.102)  (1.000)  -.469  -.036  1.000  (-.226)  (-.233)  (1.000)  .567  .207  -.178  1.000  (.656)  (.062)  (.005)  (1.000)  Operating earn-  ings/assets  Operating earn-  ings/sales  Asset  age  Asset  turnover  Excess  value  al975-1979  data  in parentheses.

There-  fore the test was repeated with the inclusion of  each and both of  these  variables.  Logit analysis provides a chi-square test for the significance of each ex-  planatory variable in predicting the CSR category in which an observation  (firm) will fall. The logit model estimated is:  CSR = a0 + a1OES + a2AGE + a3TURN + a4EV + E,  where the accounting variables are averaged in each test interval. For this  model, industry influences are controlled by subtracting industry averages  from the firm variables.  The chi-square statistic is reported for each pairwise combination of CSR  categories. The results shown in Table 4 indicate that asset age is statistically  Table  4  Logit  Results  1970-1974  Pairwise  CSR  Comparisons  Coefficient  Estimate  Chi-Square  Statistic  Best/worst  Honorable  mention/worst  Best/honorable  mention  Best/worst  Honorable  mention/worst  Best/honorable  mention  Best/worst  Honorable  mention/worst  Best/honorable  mention  Best/worst  Honorable  mention/worst  Best/honorable  mention  Best/worst  Honorable  mention/worst  Best/honorable  mention  -.408  .237  .645  -6.219  -2.121  -4.098  19.616  15.346  4.271  -.957  -.533  -.425  1.611  .974  .637  .53  .25  1.61  .08  .01  .08  5.05*  4.08*  .38  .36  .15  .10  1.80  .70  .92  1975-1979  Pairwise  CSR  Comparisons  Coefficient  Estimate  Chi-Square  Statistic  Best/worst  Honorable  mention/worst  Best/honorable  mention  Best/worst  Honorable  mention/worst  Best/honorable  mention  Best/worst  Honorable  mention/worst  Best/honorable  mention  Best/worst  Honorable  mention/worst  Best/honorable  mention  Best/worst  Honorable  mention/worst  Best/honorable  mention  .416  .994  .578  38.745  48.046  -9.301  45.035  41.604  3.431  -2.242  -3.768  -1.374  -1.606  -.868  2.162  .29  2.00  1.02  2.93  4.46*  .33  5.63*  5.02*  .22  .94  2.40  .71  .50  .16  1.32  Effect  Intercept  Operating earnings/sales  Asset  age  Asset  turnover  Excess value  Effect  Intercept  Operating earnings/sales  Asset  age  Asset  turnover  Excess value  *p<  .05  This content downloaded from 132.252.225.45 on Tue, 18 Nov 2014 14:43:12 PM All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions 54  Academy of Management Journal  March  significant in the 1975-1979 time interval at the .018 confidence level for  the best/worst distinction, at the .025 level for the honorable mention/worst  distinction, and at the .636 level for the best/honorable mention distinc-  tion. Asset age is the only variable that is significant in predicting whether  or not an observation (firm) will be best versus worst or honorable men-  tion versus worst in both time periods. No variables significantly classify  firms between the best and honorable mention categories.  Operating earnings/sales is significant at the .035 level in distinguishing  between honorable mention/worst and significant at the .087 level in dis-  tinguishing between best and worst in the second five-year period. It is in-  significant in both respects for the 1970-1974 interval.  In order to examine the possibility of bias in coefficient significance tests  from multicollinearity, the analysis was modified for both intervals by al-  ternatively dropping the EV and operating earnings variables. In every case,  the significance of the asset age variable increased, and in most cases the  significance of the remaining financial performance variables increased.  The EV best/worst pair became marginally significant in the first interval.  Operating earnings best/worst became significant and honorable men-  tion/worst dropped to marginal significance in the second interval. Con-  sequently, multicollinearity does not  appear to  alter the test outcome  significantly.  With all variables included, asset age is significant, and operating earn-  ings/sales and EV are alternatively marginally significant. When asset age  is dropped, either EV or operating earnings/sales become significant, sug-  gesting that these variables may have proxied for asset age in previous tests.  The evidence strongly suggests that the financial variable most significant-  ly associated with CSR is asset age-specifically,  firms with older assets  have lower CSR ratings. The association is strongest with the best/worst  comparison. This is understandable. The CSR measurement error would  be minimized for this comparison. The association of CSR and financial  performance, however, still is marginally significant.  Conclusions and Implications  This paper extends the study of financial performance and corporate social  responsibility by using an enhanced sample, industry-specific control groups,  and statistical tools new to this area of research. The major conclusion is  that within industry groups the financial variable most strongly correlated  with CSR is asset age and that omission of this variable results in a spurious  correlation of CSR and financial performance. Specifically, firms with older  assets have lower CSR ratings.  The source of the correlation between asset age and CSR is of interest.  One possible explanation is that firms with older assets constructed plants  in a period when regulatory constraints were less severe than they are today.  For example, if a firm built a plant prior to the mid-sixties there is an ex-  cellent chance that its facility pollutes more than one built in the recent past.

Thus the simple accident of when a firm built or acquired  its plant and equipment may have contributed to higher costs in meeting  new social demands and, at the same time, may be responsible for poorer  CSR ratings.  Another explanation is that older firms may possess less flexibility in  adapting to social change-corporate "hardening of the arteries." Man-  agement of "older" firms may simply be less responsive in both business  and social dimensions than management of "younger" firms. Alternatively,  the type of managers that "old" firms attract may differ from those at-  tracted by "young" firms. This result is consistent with the results discovered  by Sturdivant and Ginter (1977).  However, even after controlling for asset age, using a large sample, and  industry-specific control groups, there still is weak support for a link be-  tween CSR and financial performance. Therefore, part of Abbott and Mon-  sen's conclusion can be reiterated: "[B]eing socially involved [does not ap-  pear to be] dysfunctional to the investor. Perhaps it is this latter finding  that has greater significance for decision making purposes, particularly given  current political and social pressures" (1979, p. 514).  Future Research Directions  Future research in this area could proceed in a number of  directions.  First, better measures of CSR are desperately needed. It may never be pos-  sible to measure CSR objectively. Therefore research in this area could focus  on perceptions of CSR. Regular surveys of business people, business writers,  business school faculty, and the public at large could give researchers reli-  able reputation indexes for time series studies. In addition, the Beresford  studies could be replicated for recent years. Such content analysis studies  in some senses may reflect the firm's perceptions of its social responsibility.  Second, more extensive measures of CSR also are needed. It would be  very useful to have CSR rankings on at least the Fortune 500 firms over  several years. There might be separate rankings for each of several different  constituencies. This could give researchers some indications of the effects  of certain policy changes on perceptions of  CSR and subsequent effects  on financial performance.  Third, the possibility and implications of additional explanatory vari-  ables must be explored. The results of this study (i.e., that asset age is highly  correlated with CSR) throw doubt on the results of most previous studies.  The implications of this new factor should be explored and additional ex-  planatory factors sought.  Finally, causality should be investigated. No work to date has statistically  demonstrated the direction of causation between these two variables. One  promising technique would be an event study. However, in order to conduct  a valid event study better and more extensive CSR rankings will be required.
