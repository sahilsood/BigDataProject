BLUM  Georgia Institute of Technology  Although typically excluded from strategic human resource models, bundles of work-  family policies may be an HR approach related to competitive advantage. Symbolic  action and resource-based views provide conceptual support for such a relationship.  Results from a national sample of 527 U.S. firms suggest that organizations with more  extensive work-family policies have higher perceived firm-level performance. In ad-  dition, there was partial support for the hypotheses that the relationship between  work-family bundles and firm performance is stronger for older firms and firms  employing larger proportions of women.  THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND  HYPOTHESES  The idea that human resource (HR) management  has some utility to organizations, beyond satisfying  regulatory agencies and employees, is not new. In  fact, some authors have described human resource  management as a means of achieving competitive  advantage (Pfeffer, 1994). Consistent with this per-  spective, the relationship between a variety of hu-  man resource practices and firm performance has  been investigated (e.g., Arthur, 1994; Delaney &  Huselid, 1996; MacDuffie, 1995). Although the in-  dividual practices included in strategic HR models  vary to some extent, work-family policies have  been noticeably excluded. Although work-family  policies can be considered progressive and innova-  tive, they have rarely, if ever, been considered stra-  tegic, let alone a "best practice" (Pfeffer, 1994). This  exclusion may reflect the fact that very little re-  search has investigated the outcomes of work-  family initiatives at the organizational level, and  research investigating adoption has pointed to in-  stitutional pressure (Goodstein, 1994; Ingram & Si-  mons, 1995). Although proponents argue that  work-family policies are beneficial to organizations  (Gonyea & Googins, 1992; Kamerman & Kahn,  1987), we found no empirical tests supporting this  belief in the literature. The purpose of this study  was to address this "disconnect" by investigating  the relationship between bundles of work-family  policies and organizational performance.  Taking a bundle approach, rather than focusing  one-by-one on individual work-family policies, is  consistent with ideas advanced in strategic HR re-  search (Becker & Gerhart, 1996; Ichniowski, Shaw,  & Prennushi, 1997; MacDuffie, 1995). A work-  family bundle can be defined as a group of comple-  mentary, highly related and, in some cases, over-  lapping human resource policies that may help  employees manage nonwork roles. Work-family re-  search (Goodstein, 1994; Ingram & Simons, 1995;  Osterman, 1995) suggests that the types of individ-  ual policies that may be part of such a bundle  include dependent care services, flexible schedul-  ing programs (including various types of family  leave), and information and referral services. How-  ever, the bundle approach is less focused on spe-  cific components and is more focused on the extent  to which the policies are highly related and inter-  active in a way that suggests an organization-level  approach or philosophy. As a result, an HR bundle  captures a broader, higher-level effect than that  which can be captured by focusing on individual  policies and is particularly appropriate for investi-  gating firm-level effects (Becker & Gerhart, 1996).  Consistent with these ideas, a growing body of  work-family research has focused on a range of  policies (Goodstein, 1994; Ingram & Simons, 1995;  Osterman, 1995) or an overall philosophy related to  family friendliness (e.g., Grover & Crooker, 1995;  Judge, Boudreau, & Bretz, 1994).  We thank Charles Parsons and Christina Shalley for  comments on earlier versions. We also thank Anne Tsui  and the anonymous reviewers for the useful suggestions  and comments provided throughout the review process.  As with other HR bundles (Becker & Gerhart,  1996; Pfeffer, 1994), the mechanism through which  work-family bundles add value at the firm level is  complex and not intuitively obvious. According to  Pfeffer's (1981) symbolic action perspective, ac-  1107 This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Tue, 14 Feb 2017 02:17:24 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1108  Academy of Management Journal  December  tions that symbolize organizational concern or spe-  cial treatment, regardless of their actual content,  can provide intangible benefits to organizations.  Organizational actions, like offering bundles of  work-family policies, supply signals to current and  potential employees that allow them to make con-  clusions about the values and philosophies of an  organization. Because work-family bundles pro-  vide relief for nonwork concerns, a benefit that is  not mandatory and has not yet been institutional-  ized across organizations, employees may feel that  they are receiving special treatment. Furthermore, a  range of work-family policies is likely to both sym-  bolize that the organization cares about employee  well-being and to represent a value system (Grover  & Crooker, 1995). In a work context with these  discretionary employee-centered values, employ-  ees are likely to respond favorably. They will recip-  rocate by contributing extra effort, by developing a  concern for the overall success of the organization,  and by embracing its goals (MacDuffie, 1995; Os-  troff, 1992; Pfeffer, 1994). As a result, a context of  enhanced organizational performance will likely  emerge (Ostroff, 1992).  Work-family bundles may create value for firms,  but their contribution to firm-level performance is  further supported by the idea that bundles of inter-  related work-family policies may also be a source of  sustained competitive advantage. According to the  resource-based view of the firm (e.g., Barney, 1991;  Wright & McMahan, 1992), an internal resource can  be a source of a sustained competitive advantage  when the strategic advantage created is not easily  imitated. The complex mechanism through which  work-family bundles may influence performance  reflects causal ambiguity that reduces the likeli-  hood of imitation. In addition, imitation by com-  petitors is impeded when the internal resource is  socially complex. The synergies created by the  range of policies in a work-family bundle and the  broader corporate philosophy it reflects may ham-  per imitation.  ing of control. In addition, this softening of firmly  drawn organizational boundaries requires a funda-  mental shift in common organizational paradigms.  Organizational decision makers may unjustifiably  fear attracting workers on the "family track" with  less stable employment patterns and less organiza-  tional commitment. Therefore, quite a bit of change  is required to go from having no work-family poli-  cies to providing a comprehensive work-family  bundle, and adoption of such a bundle is not likely  to be easy.  It is consistent with the existence of these barri-  ers to imitation that bundles of work-family poli-  cies continue to be rare among U.S. firms (Ingram &  Simons, 1995; Osterman, 1995). Although certain  individual work-family policies are more common  than others, a comprehensive set continues to be an  exception within many industries. This rarity, par-  ticularly at the system level, is shared by other  strategic HR systems (Ichniowski et al., 1997; Pfef-  fer, 1994, 1997) and further supports the competi-  tive advantage potential of work-family bundles.  Therefore, because bundles of work family policies  are expected to be a source of sustained competi-  tive advantage and add value to firms via their  representation as favorable organizational actions,  we expected these bundles to be positively related  to a firm's performance.  Hypothesis 1. Firms with more comprehensive  bundles of work-family policies will have  higher organizational performance than firms  with less comprehensive bundles.  Several organizational characteristics may mod-  erate the relationship between work-family bun-  dles and firm performance. Firms that are more  subjected to institutional pressure or that exist in  more institutionalized environments should re-  ceive greater benefits from the adoption of work-  family policies. Firm size has been one indicator of  the extent to which a firm concedes to institutional  demands, with larger firms expected to be more  affected by such pressures (Goodstein, 1994; Kalle-  berg & Van Buren, 1996). Firms that act in accor-  dance with institutional pressures, such as larger  firms, should receive legitimacy and survival  "credits" (Meyer & Rowan, 1977), and symbolic  actions should be more easily processed in an en-  vironment in which such actions are valued or  encouraged. In addition, larger firms tend to be  more likely to adopt work-family policies (Good-  stein, 1994; Ingram & Simons, 1995). This finding  suggests that larger firms may be at the forefront of  adoption and thus can be considered "early adopt-  ers," an advantageous position. Although smaller  firms can more easily adopt work-family policies,  Furthermore, the imitation of work-family bun-  dles is hindered because adoption is complex and  difficult. Noneconomic barriers may interfere with  the adoption of progressive practices, even those  that may have firm-level benefits (Ichniowski et al.,  1997; Pfeffer, 1997). Essentially, management's be-  lief system and attitudes about managing employ-  ees may restrict the adoption of multiple work-  family policies (Kossek, Dass, & DeMarr, 1994). A  unique feature of work-family bundles is that they  can take employees outside of organizational  boundaries or bring their families inside. This sit-  uation requires, in some cases, a greater amount of  trust on the part of management and the relinquish- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Tue, 14 Feb 2017 02:17:24 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2000  Perry-Smith and Blum  1109  they may be more likely to do so only when these  policies are more firmly established. At this later  stage of adoption, the competitive advantage poten-  tial of these policies may be lessened. Furthermore,  a range of policies provides enhanced flexibility,  allowing a firm to maintain sustainable fit with an  unstable and changing environment (Wright &  Snell, 1998). This flexibility may be particularly  beneficial for larger firms that are otherwise sub-  jected to inertial forces and rigidity that limit  change. For smaller firms, flexibility based on mul-  tiple policies may be less important, given the flex-  ibility already inherent in the systems and pro-  cesses characteristic of small firms. Therefore,  Hypothesis 2a. The relationship between work-  family human resource bundles and firm per-  formance will be stronger for larger firms than  for smaller firms.  Younger firms tend to be more concerned with  mere survival than older, more established firms  (Martinez & Dacin, 1999; Meyer & Rowan, 1977). As  a result, access to critical resources and legitimacy  are very important to a young firm, and efficiency  considerations may be less pressing. The younger  firm, therefore, may be more likely to "ceremonial-  ly adopt" policies and practices that are seen as  legitimate, particularly when analysis of the costs  and benefits of these policies is ambiguous (Mar-  tinez & Dacin, 1999). In a similar circumstance, an  older firm is more likely to balance efficiency con-  siderations with desires for legitimacy. For these  firms, which are less preoccupied with mere sur-  vival, efficiency (or profit maximization) consider-  ations play a larger role. To achieve both aims, the  older firm may be more likely to apply a loosely  coupled approach in which its technical core can  be "buffered" (Greening & Gray, 1994; Martinez &  Dacin, 1999). This loosely coupled approach al-  lows organizational effectiveness to be enhanced  without contributing to internal ineffectiveness.  This "efficient imitation" approach should be more  effective than ceremonial adoption (Martinez &  Dacin, 1999). Therefore, the adoption strategy more  likely to be chosen by an older firm in a context of  ambiguous information, like that surrounding  work-family policies, should result in greater effec-  tiveness benefits.  work-family policies, a key assumption is that they  are a salient need and reflect an important value  system for women. As a result, the extent to which  a firm employs women is expected to be related to  its adoption of work-family policies (Goodstein,  1994; Ingram & Simons, 1995; Milliken, Martins, &  Morgan, 1998). Similarly, we can expect that firms  with a greater proportion of employees who value  work-family policies will experience greater sym-  bolic value from adopting these policies. Therefore,  Hypothesis 2c. The relationship between work-  family human resource bundles and firm per-  formance will be stronger for firms employing  greater proportions of women.  Several variables might contribute to alternative  explanations for the hypothesized relationships.  These needed to be controlled for in the analyses.  The variables selected as controls here are consis-  tent with those used by Delaney and Huselid (1996)  and with those found in work-family research. Di-  visions of larger firms may be more likely to offer  progressive HR practices than other organizations,  and status as a for-profit or nonprofit organization  may account for differences in practices and per-  formance goals. In addition, an organization's com-  petitive environment may affect performance and  the tendency to implement nonstandard practices.  The presence of other progressive HR practices may  be related to the presence of work-family policies;  in fact, a work-family bundle may be part of a  broader system of innovative HR practices. Simi-  larly, firms in nonmanufacturing industries are  more likely to adopt other HR initiatives as well as  work-family policies (Blum, Fields, & Goodman,  1994; Ingram & Simons, 1995; Milliken et al., 1998),  and firm performance measures are expected to  differ for manufacturing and nonmanufacturing  firms (Terpstra & Rozell, 1993). Levels of standard  benefits, such as health insurance and life insur-  ance, are also relevant, because they suggest a  firm's tendency to share excess resources with em-  ployees (Osterman, 1995). Additional factors that  may have implications for the adoption of progres-  sive practices and firm performance include the  extent to which a firm faces union pressure and the  percentage of employees who are managers.  Hypothesis 2b. The relationship between work-  family human resource bundles and firm per-  formance will be stronger for older firms than  for younger firms.  Firms seek to control critical internal resources,  such as their workforces, by being responsive to  their needs (Pfeffer & Salancik, 1978). In the case of  METHODS  Data  The data were obtained from the National Or-  ganizations Survey (NOS; Kalleberg, Knoke, Mars-  den, & Spaeth, 1993, 1994), a national study of U.S.  work establishments conducted by the Survey Re- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Tue, 14 Feb 2017 02:17:24 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1110  Academy of Management Journal  December  search Laboratory of the University of Illinois. The  organizations included in the NOS were identified  from responses to the 1991 General Social Survey  (GSS), an annual face-to-face survey of the adult  U.S. population. As a result, the probability that a  firm is included in the NOS sample is proportion-  ate to its number of employees (Spaeth & O'Rourke,  1994). However, an organization was only included  once in the NOS even if it was identified by more  than one respondent. Telephone interviews were  conducted, and a moderate proportion of inter-  views required more than two sessions (26%). Al-  though the designated informant was a personnel  director type, 17 percent of the cases required the  interviewers to contact more than one respondent  to obtain the range of factual data required. Overall,  64.5 percent (727) of the establishments contacted  (1,127) were respondents, or 50.9 percent of the  establishments identified by GSS respondents.  These 727 establishments represent a variety of  industries and sizes and were found to be represen-  tative of firms in the United States (Spaeth &  O'Rourke, 1994). Although the sample was reduced  to 527 for our study because of missing data, the  distribution of industry and firm size for the 527  firms is generally consistent with that for the  dropped firms; differences include overrepresenta-  tion of business services (for example, advertising  and personnel services) and underrepresentation of  personal services (for example, hotels and cleaning  services).  Measures  Independent variables. Eight work-family poli-  cies were included in the analyses: on-site day care,  help with day care costs, elder care assistance, in-  formation on community day care, paid parental  leave, unpaid parental leave, maternity or paternity  leave with reemployment, and flexible scheduling.  These eight policies have been widely represented  in the work-family literature (e.g., Goodstein, 1994;  Ingram & Simons, 1995; Osterman, 1995) and cor-  respond with specific NOS questions that were  coded 1 if a company had the policy and 0 if it did  not. We performed a principal component factor  analysis with varimax rotation to categorize the  individual work-family policies. Two factors with  eigenvalues greater than 1.00 were extracted; how-  ever, these factors involved cross-loadings for sev-  eral of the individual policies. To obtain cleaner  loadings, we set the number of factors equal to  three and obtained better results. The third factor  had an eigenvalue equal to 0.97, and the three  factors together explained 55 percent of the vari-  ance. In an additional analysis, we performed prin-  cipal component factor analysis with varimax rota-  tion using the polychoric correlations between  the dichotomous work-family policies, and the re-  sulting factors were the same. The three factors can  be described as leave policies (leave, unpaid paren-  tal leave, and paid parental leave), traditional de-  pendent care (day care, flexible scheduling, and  child care information), and less traditional depen-  dent care (monetary assistance with day care and  elder care assistance).  Dependent variables. We used three dependent  variables in this study to reflect firm-level perfor-  mance. Two of these, organizational performance  and market performance, are the perceptual mea-  sures of firm performance used by Delaney and  Huselid (1996), who also used data from the NOS.  Organizational performance, a seven-item measure  (a = .87) of perceived firm performance assessed  relative to that of other firms doing the same kind of  work, includes items such as the quality of prod-  ucts, the ability to attract essential employees, and  relations between management and employees.  The second dependent variable, market perfor-  mance, is a four-item measure (a = .85) of per-  ceived market performance assessed relative to that  of other firms and includes items related to market-  ing and market share. The third dependent vari-  able, profit and sales growth, is a two-item measure  of a firm's percentage increase in sales and profits  over the last 12 months (r = .75). The market per-  formance and profit-sales growth items were only  available for profit-making firms.  Three scales based on the three identified factors  were created, and standardized values for the three  items were entered in a cluster analysis. We  identified the number of clusters using two differ-  ent hierarchical procedures (Ward's method and  weighted-average) using Euclidean distance mea-  sures. To check the reliability of the clusters, we  employed the recommended split-sample method-  ology (Ketchen & Shook, 1996; Milligan, 1996). A  discriminant equation based on a random half of  the sample identified clusters in a second half of  the sample. A comparison between the clusters  identified in this manner and a cluster analysis on  the second half of the sample suggested a reason-  able level of agreement (Cohen's K = 0.43, p < .01).  We obtained the final cluster groupings by apply-  ing the number of clusters identified in the hierar-  chical procedure to the nonhierarchical, K-means,  procedure. Table 1 shows the means and number of  cases for each of the four clusters identified: or-  ganizations in which all of the categories repre-  sented are relatively scarce, organizations in which  leave policies and less traditional dependent care  policies are prevalent, organizations in which leave This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Tue, 14 Feb 2017 02:17:24 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  2000  Perry-Smith and Blum  1111  Descriptive Statistics for Work-Family Clustersa  TABLE 1  Variable Policies Dependent Careb Dependent Carec Policies  Group 1: Low on All Group 2: Leaves and Group 3: Leaves Group 4: High on All  Work-Family Less Traditional and Traditional Work-Family  Leave policies -0.90 (0.82) 0.49 (0.61) 0.55 (0.61) 0.52 (0.58)  Traditional dependent care -0.68 (0.62) -0.25 (0.56) 0.40 (0.86) 1.51 (0.42)  Less traditional dependent care -0.56 (0.21) 1.46 (0.72) -0.58 (0.00) 1.56 (0.76)  Firm size 2.84 (1.99) 5.17 (2.22) 4.79 (1.92) 5.87 (2.05)  Firm age 2.88 (1.10) 3.48 (1.07) 3.17 (1.16) 3.52 (0.99)  Percentage of women 41.98 (41.01) 43.68 (37.64) 50.76 (38.74) 55.00 (35.72)  Number of cases 178 88 195 66  a Figures in parentheses are standard deviations.  b Less traditional dependent care includes elder care and monetary assistance with day care.  c Traditional dependent care includes on-site day care, child care information, and flexible scheduling.  policies and traditional dependent care policies are  prevalent, and organizations in which all three cat-  egories of work-family policies are prevalent.  the founding year; and the proportion of women  was measured as the percentage of women in core  positions (jobs that are directly involved with the  main product or service of a firm).  Moderators and control variables. The control  variables used for this study, with the exception of  standard benefits, were also used by Delaney and  Huselid (1996). The extent to which a firm offered  progressive HR practices was measured with four  scales and two single-item measures: staffing selec-  tivity (a = .75), training effectiveness (a = .91),  incentive compensation (a = .84), grievance proce-  dures, decentralized decision making (a = .91), and  number of occupational levels (vertical hierarchy).  A dichotomous variable was used to indicate if an  organization was part of a larger organization (a  subsidiary), and a dummy variable was incorpo-  rated to capture profit or not-for-profit status. The  variable union pressure reflected responses about  problems with union relations, with "no problem"  coded 1 and "major problems" coded 3, and indus-  try effects were controlled by creating a dummy  variable, industry type, distinguishing between  manufacturing and nonmanufacturing industries.  The percentage of managers was captured by a vari-  able reflecting the proportion of employees in man-  agement positions. Two questions that addressed  the extent of domestic or foreign competition in a  firm's main product or service area (1 = "no com-  petition" and 4 = "a great deal") were combined to  form the competitive pressure variable, and a scale  was created with each of the standard benefits  (health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance,  disability insurance, sick leave, pension programs,  and drug/alcohol programs) coded 1 if a company  offered the benefit and 0 if the company did not.  The moderator variables were measured as follows:  Firm size was the logarithm of total employees;  firm age was the natural logarithm of 1991 minus  Validation of dependent and independent vari-  ables. We checked the validity of components of  the firm performance measures by comparing the  NOS informants' responses with another source,  the U.S. Industrial Outlook (U.S. Department of  Commerce, 1992). Sales growth for ten "selected  industries," representing construction and manu-  facturing, was used to verify the sales growth re-  sponses. Sales growth for 1990 was selected be-  cause the NOS data collection period started in  April 1991. The U.S. Industrial Outlook's subset of  industries was matched with the detailed NOS in-  dustry codes, and averages were obtained. The  rank-order correlation for the subset of industries  was .60 (p < .05). In addition, we used Standard &  Poor's COMPUSTAT to verify the mean industry  profit growth for all sampled industries except pub-  lic administration. Ten industry groups were used,  including agriculture, various services, and retail  establishments. The mean profit growth for the  NOS and COMPUSTAT was calculated; the rank-  order correlation between the two data sets was .72  (p < .05). This correlation also involved a subset of  firms because the NOS sales information was only  available for profit-making firms. Rank-order corre-  lation was used for both the profit and sales vali-  dation because the comparisons were only possible  in the aggregate and involved a small number of  categories.  To validate components of the independent vari-  able, we compared the work-family policies iden-  tified by employees of the organizations included  in the NOS (GSS participants) with the HR infor-  mants' responses.

The percent  agreement for each work-family policy that the in-  dividual employees were asked about is as follows:  parental leave, 72 percent; flexible scheduling, 60  percent; child care information, 72 percent; and  monetary assistance with day care, 81 percent.  ANALYSES AND RESULTS  Table 2 presents the means, standard deviations,  and zero-order correlations for the variables. Corre-  lations are displayed for all firms (for-profit and  nonprofit) as well as for the reduced data set of  for-profit firms only.  (p < .10). Although the post hoc Scheffe test for  organizational performance was not significant,  planned comparisons (t-tests) between the two  clusters were significant for both the smaller sam-  ple using multivariate analysis and the larger sam-  ple (p < .10 and p < .05, respectively). In addition,  a significant difference existed between the firms  likely to have only leave and less traditional work-  family policies and those tending to have all  work-family policies for profit-sales growth, mar-  ket performance, and organizational performance  (Scheffe, p < .05 to p < .10). Therefore, the results  support the hypothesis that firms with more work-  family policies have higher firm-level performance  than firms with fewer work-family policies.  The hypotheses were assessed with multivariate  analysis of covariance (MANCOVA). The four clus-  ter groupings identified in Table 1 were entered as  the independent variables; the three firm perfor-  mance measures (organizational performance, mar-  ket performance, and profit-sales growth) were en-  tered as the dependent variables; and all of the  control variables were entered as covariates. The  multivariate effect for the work-family cluster  groupings was significant (Wilks's A = 0.93,  F 9,699 = 2.43, p < .05, r/2 = .03). Therefore, an  investigation of the univariate effects was war-  ranted. The univariate results are presented in Ta-  ble 3, along with the mean for each cluster grouping  for each of the three dependent variables. The or-  ganizational performance dependent variable was  also assessed using a separate ANCOVA because of  the large loss in cases when this variable was ana-  lyzed with the other two variables; these results are  also presented in Table 3.  Hypotheses 2a-2c predict a significant interac-  tion between the work-family clusters and firm  size, firm age, and the percentage of women em-  ployed, respectively. The multivariate effect of the  interaction between firm size and the work-family  clusters was not significant (Wilks's A = 0.95,  F 9,691 = 1.52, p > .10, T2 = .02). Therefore,  Hypothesis 2a is not supported. The multivariate  effect of the interaction between firm age and the  work-family clusters (Wilks's A = 0.93, F 9, 691  2.49, p < .01, j 2 = .03) and the percentage of  women and the work-family clusters (Wilks's A =  0.92, F 9 691 = 2.75, p < .01, '}2 = .03) were signif-  icant. The univariate effect was significant for prof-  it-sales growth for both the firm age and work-  family cluster interaction (F 3, 286 = 4.54, p < .01,  12 = .05) and the percentage of women and work-  family interaction (F3 286 = 4.00, p < .01, r2 = .04).  However, this effect was not significant for market  growth or organizational performance for either in-  teraction.  As predicted in Hypothesis 1, we expected the  work-family clusters to be correlated with different  levels of firm performance. Differences in perceived  organizational performance across the different  groupings of work-family policies were significant  both in multivariate analyses (F3 289 = 3.51, p < .05,  2 = .04) and in individual analyses run with the  larger sample size (F3, 57 = 356, p < .05, r2 = .02).  Similarly, in the case of perceived market perfor-  mance, differences in work-family policies were sig-  nificant (F3,289 = 4.07, p < .01, ]2 = .04). In addition,  the effect of the cluster groupings of work-family pol-  icies was significant when profit-sales growth was  used as the dependent variable (F 3 289 = 3.58,  p < .05, _q2 = .04).  Post hoc Scheffe comparisons confirmed a signif-  icant difference between the clusters reflecting  firms likely to have all the work-family policies and  firms likely to have few work-family policies for  the profit-sales growth dependent variable (p < .05)  and the market performance dependent variable  We used a post hoc analysis (a Scheffe partial  interaction contrast) to further explore the signifi-  cant effects for profit-sales growth. The interaction  between (1) the comparison of firms likely to have  all work-family policies and those likely to have no  work-family policies and (2) firm age was positive  and significant (p < .05). Consistent with Hypoth-  esis 2b, this suggests that the relationship between  more work-family policies and performance is  greater for older firms. Similarly, a post hoc Scheffe  partial interaction contrast analysis of the interac-  tion between firms with more work-family policies  and those with none and the percentage of women  employees was positive and significant (p < .05).  This suggests that the relationship between having  more work-family policies and performance is  greater for firms with higher proportions of women,  providing support for Hypothesis 2c. Overall, Hy-  potheses 2b and 2c were partially supported be-  cause the results did not support these interactions This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Tue, 14 Feb 2017 02:17:24 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  Means, Standard Deviations, and Correlations for All Variablesa  TABLE 2  Variable Mean s.d. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19  1.

DISCUSSION  The findings suggest that the presence of a bun-  dle of work-family policies is positively associated  with perceived firm-level performance. Specifi-  cally, organizations with a greater range of work-  family policies have higher levels of organizational  performance, market performance, and profit-sales  growth. In addition to supporting the specific hy-  potheses of this study, the significant link between  work-family bundles and performance provides  support for both a symbolic action perspective and  the resource-based view of the firm. Work-family  bundles may promote obligation and interest in  organizations because such policies serve as posi-  tive symbols for employees. Furthermore, work-  family bundles may be a source of competitive  advantage in a business climate in which their  adoption is limited.  Future Research  should be considered when age dependency rela-  tionships are examined. As was the case with firm  age, the relationship between a work-family bundle  and firm performance seems to vary as a function of  the proportion of women only for profit-sales out-  comes. This overall weak finding for the proportion  of women interaction may suggest that gender  should receive less attention in work-family re-  search and that other factors, such as life stage  variables, may be more instructive. Finally, the re-  lationship between work-family and firm perfor-  mance does not appear to be moderated by firm  size. Neither legitimacy and survival credits de-  rived from conforming to institutional pressures  nor early adopter status may be strong enough to  differentiate larger firms from smaller firms.  Numerous avenues can be explored to build  upon the results presented here. A deeper investi-  gation of work-family issues, going beyond a sim-  ple "more is better" approach, should provide valu-  able additional insight. To the extent our measures  are limited, more extensive measures of work-  family bundles may yield stronger effects. For  instance, the depth of work-family policies, in ad-  dition to their breadth, may enhance firm-level  effects. The extent to which such policies are used  and fully ingrained in the culture and operations of  an organization may have effects beyond the sym-  bolic ones we have suggested. In addition, future  studies should incorporate various types of flexible  work designs as well as more current and creative  Although the direct effect of work-family bun-  dles was consistent and easily interpretable, inter-  actions with a variety of organizational factors were  less clear. The relationship between a work-family  bundle and firm performance appears to be moder-  ated by firm age for only one of the three firm  outcome measures, profit and sales growth. The  limited findings for the firm age interaction may be  explained by Hannan's (1998) idea regarding the  inconsistencies of age effects in organizational re-  search.

A third limitation, the small variance ac-  counted for by the work-family variables and inter-  action terms, suggests caution should be applied  when ascribing practical significance to the find-  ings. Finally, perceptual measures of performance  are not as desirable as objective measures; the ob-  served results may be partially due to attribution  bias. However, research has suggested a high de-  gree of correlation exists between objective and  perceptual measures of performance (Dess & Rob-  inson, 1984; Dollinger & Golden, 1992), and per-  ceptual survey measures are a meaningful tool, par-  ticularly when multiple sources are used to  validate measures and when an area of research is  in the early stages of development (Spector, 1994).  Conclusion  Despite the limitations discussed, the results of  this study advance the field by empirically show-  ing a link between bundles of human resource  work-family policies and organizational outcomes.  The robustness of the effects of the presence of such  policies in highly stringent models that include  many controls and across a variety of firm-level  performance measures is noteworthy. The interra-  ter agreement of components of the work-family  index is another strength of this study. In addition,  the rigor of the NOS data collection procedure and  sampling frame and the representativeness of the  sample are also positive features. Overall, this re-  search endeavor suggests a relationship exists be-  tween work-family bundles and several dimen-  sions of organizational performance. Perhaps an  HR bundle that gives employees the flexibility, the  information, the convenience, and the financial as-  sistance to better manage their nonwork lives can  be considered strategic and should be added to the  list of the "best practices" of strategic human re-  source management.  dependent care approaches. The policies used in  this study reflected those previously studied, but  they were not an exhaustive set.  In addition, more consideration should be given  to moderators in future research. For instance, the  association between work-family policies and per-  formance may depend on a firm's business strategy,  its management's attitudes and orientation toward  work-family policies, and the supportiveness of the  firm's culture. Workforce characteristics associated  with employees' life stages should also be ex-  plored, and the extent to which work-family bun-  dles are part of a broader innovative HR system or  are distinct from other strategic practices needs  further attention. With regard to environmental fac-  tors, industry interconnectedness and the availabil-  ity of community-based work-family support op-  tions may diminish the competitive advantage  associated with work-family bundles.  Future research should also investigate the  mechanisms through which work-family policies  affect firm performance. Although our intent was  not to specify intervening mechanisms, the sym-  bolic action perspective and the resource-based  view suggest several possibilities. For example, em-  ployee attitudes such as organizational commit-  ment and employee behaviors such as organiza-  tional citizenship may serve as mediators. In  addition, the extent to which other firms do not  understand or have difficulty in implementing an  extensive range of work-family policies may be rel-  evant to performance effects. However, other theo-  retical perspectives (see Wright & Snell, 1998) may  be more useful for understanding mediating vari-  ables.  Limitations  The results presented in this study are a nice  starting point for future research, but it is important  to keep the study's limitations in mind. One limi-  tation is the use of cross-sectional data. Whether  firm performance predicts the adoption of work-  family bundles is a question that could be more  conclusively answered with longitudinal designs.  Another issue is common method variance. Gener-  ally, collection of data for both the dependent vari-  able and the independent variable from the same  source is problematic. However, the agreement be-  tween the organizational informant and individual  employee responses and the correlation between  objective data and perceived profit and sales  growth provide some assurance as to the validity of  the data. In addition, the results of a Harmon one-  factor test (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986) suggested  common method variance was not likely to be a  REFERENCES  Arthur, J. B. 1994.
