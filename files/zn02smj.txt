NIELSEN2 1 J.MackRobinsonCollegeofBusiness,GeorgiaStateUniversity,Atlanta,Georgia, U.S.A. 2 CenterforIndustrialProduction,AalborgUniversity,Aalborg,Denmark In recent years, companies have increased their use of internal and external sources in pursuit of a competitive advantage through the effective and timely commercialization of new technology. Grounded in the resource-based view of the ﬁrm, this study examines the effect of a company’s use of internal and external sources on multiple dimensions of successful technology commer- cialization (TC). The study also explores the moderating role of formal vs. informal integration mechanisms on these relationships. Applying a longitudinal design and data from 119 companies, the results show that internal human and technology-based manufacturing sources are positively associated with successful TC. Formal and informal integration mechanisms also signiﬁcantly moderate the relationships observed between capability sources and TC. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Successful technology commercialization (TC) is important for survival in today’s competitive markets (Cooper, 2000). Mitchell and Singh (1996: 170) view TC as ‘the process of acquiring ideas, augmenting them with complementary knowledge, developing and manufacturing saleable goods, and selling the goods in a market.’ This process begins with product conception; includes the product def- inition, design, prototyping and pretesting stages; and is consummated by effective product manu- facturing and marketing. Successful TC allows the ﬁrm to satisfy its customers’ needs in terms of the cost, speed, quality, and newness attributes of their technologies. However, TC requires strong and varied capabilities, especially in manufac- turing (Ettlie, 1997; Siegel, Hansen, and Pellas, 1995). Manufacturing capabilities are grounded in the ﬁrm’s people, skills, knowledge, processes, systems, and equipment. These capabilities can technology commercialization; capability Key words: sources; integration; resource-based theory *Correspondence to: Shaker A. Zahra, Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University, Atlanta, GA 30303, U.S.A. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. be assembled from different internal and external sources (Teece, Pisano and Shuen, 1997) and then deployed to create products and introduce them to the market in a timely manner. Despite the growing use of internal and exter- nal sources of capabilities, researchers have not systematically documented the contributions of these sources to TC. This is especially the case with manufacturing sources. Consequently, most of the existing evidence is anecdotal (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi, 1995). Internal and external manufac- turing sources have advantages and shortcomings that arise from their nature or the way they are managed (Barney, 1999). Though some shortcom- ings can be overcome through the effective integra- tion of these sources into TC (Song, Souder, and Dyer, 1997), empirical evidence is sparse (Ragatz, Handﬁeld, and Scannell, 1997). This gap in the literature reﬂects researchers’ focus on the inte- gration of the manufacturing unit, rather than the sources of capabilities in TC. Researchers have also studied the conditions that favor different sources (Williamson, 1999), emphasizing industry and competitive conditions (Combs and Ketchen, Received 21 May 1998 Final revision received 25 September 2001 378 S. A. Zahra and A. P. Nielsen 1999; Teece, 1986) but have failed to analyze how companies integrate their internal and exter- nal sources within TC. It is also not clear from the literature how formal and informal integration mechanisms inﬂuence the relationships between manufacturing sources and the various TC dimen- sions. Researchers have also selectively analyzed particular dimensions of TC while ignoring oth- ers, overlooking the potential trade-offs among these dimensions. This article attempts to address these gaps in the literature by considering multiple dimensions of TC. The objectives of this study are twofold. First, it examines the effect of a ﬁrm’s use of inter- nal and external sources on TC. The study ana- lyzes the impact of different manufacturing sources on TC but does not consider how these capabili- ties are assembled. Second, it explores the mod- erating effect of integration on the relationships between different manufacturing sources and var- ious TC dimensions. Integration involves formal or informal mechanisms that coordinate the use of internal and external manufacturing sources within TC (Song et al., 1997). These sources determine the type, quality, and deftness of manufacturing capabilities. These capabilities indicate the ﬁrm’s capacity to perform productive activities (Grant, 1998). The study considers the moderating effects of formal and informal integration mechanisms on internal or external manufacturing sources on TC. This study makes three contributions to litera- ture. First, it recognizes the multiplicity of man- ufacturing sources and their potential implications for TC. Second, it simultaneously considers TC as a multidimensional construct. Prior research has examined these dimensions separately, resulting in contradictory ﬁndings. Third, the study’s research design provides insights into the effects of man- ufacturing sources on TC over time. Prior studies have used cross-sectional designs, making it difﬁ- cult to evaluate the long-term effect of manufac- turing sources on TC. We use a 3-year lag between TC dimensions and sources. We also rely on sec- ondary data to capture TC and primary data to gauge sources, overcoming concerns about prior results that have used perceptual data. The next section of the article reviews the lit- erature, highlighting the importance and the mul- tiple dimensions of TC. Drawing on the resource- based view (RBV), the article advances hypothe- ses on the relationships between manufacturing sources and integration mechanisms on TC. The article then presents a study that empirically tests these hypotheses, followed by a discussion of the ﬁndings and their managerial and scholarly implications. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES Successful TC is multifaceted. It refers to a ﬁrm’s ability to: (1) develop and introduce a large num- ber of product and process technologies (Zahra and Covin, 1993); (2) create radically new prod- ucts (Zahra, 1996); (3) expedite the introduction of these new products to the market (Stevens, Burley, and Divine, 1999); and (4) create new knowledge (Leonard-Barton, 1995). We believe these dimen- sions should be considered simultaneously in order to understand the factors that inﬂuence TC. Different TC dimensions play different roles in enabling the ﬁrm to develop a competitive advan- tage. The intensity of a ﬁrm’s product introduc- tions refers to the frequent introduction of products relative to the industry average or key rivals. New products help a company gain market leadership, and to achieve growth and proﬁtability (Iansiti, 1995). They also enhance the company’s under- standing of its customers’ needs and improve its responsiveness to the market (Day, 1999). Prod- uct radicalness signiﬁes the newness or innova- tiveness of the products being introduced to the market (Rosenau, 2001). It enables the company to develop new markets or capture existing market share and thereby achieve growth. TC speed indi- cates a ﬁrm’s ability to introduce new products or technologies more quickly than its competitors. This allows the ﬁrm to ﬂank or attack its com- petitors, reduce costs, improve quality, absorb new technologies, expedite learning from customers (Eisenhardt, 1990; Iansiti, 1995), and improve new market performance (Calantone, Vickery, and Droge, 1995). The new knowledge created through TC also enables the ﬁrm to develop radically innovative products that transform the competitive landscape. The RBV suggests that internal and external manufacturing sources, derived from human or technical assets and resources (Teece, 1986), can determine TC success. These sources give the ﬁrm the knowledge it needs to successfully pursue TC. This knowledge determines TC success. Though TC is the outcome of several Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002) Capabilities and Technology Commercialization 379 organizational processes (e.g., strategic planning) and strategic choices (including manufacturing sources), and processes (e.g., strategic planning), different manufacturing sources signiﬁcantly affect TC dimensions differently. As Figure 1 suggests, these effects will be moderated by integration, as discussed in the following paragraphs. Capability sources and TC Manufacturing plays a key role in determining a ﬁrm’s competitive position (White, 1996). Internal and external sources are the founda- tions of a ﬁrm’s manufacturing capabilities (Grant, 1998). These capabilities evolve, reﬂecting shifts in technological trajectories, deﬁned as the paths particular technologies follow over time (Dosi, 1982). These evolutionary paths depend on exist- ing scientiﬁc knowledge and are fueled by a quest for improving a given technology’s performance. As this technology enters a new phase, some com- panies experience a mismatch between their exist- ing capabilities and the requirements for success- ful TC. The RBV suggests that a company with strong manufacturing capabilities can enjoy an enduring competitive advantage and achieve superior perfor- mance (Stalk, Evans, and Shulman 1992). These capabilities enable the ﬁrm to develop new prod- ucts and expedite their market introductions. How- ever, external market factors sometimes constrain the supply of certain manufacturing sources (Dier- ickx and Cool, 1989). Some manufacturing sources are not tradable and must be built internally (Bar- ney, 1999). Over time, some internal capabilities become rigid and limit TC success. Further, in dynamic markets, exclusive reliance on the internal sources of manufacturing capabilities have serious drawbacks. New products are increasingly com- plex (Leonard-Barton, 1995) and require multiple capabilities that few companies have internally. Companies also selectively build certain man- ufacturing capabilities, leaving them vulnerable to market shifts. A ﬁrm’s internal manufactur- ing capabilities might also be constrained by its prior investments, poor management, and internal process inefﬁciencies. Capabilities also develop at different rates and follow different evolutionary paths, creating signiﬁcant difﬁculties in accumu- lating those capabilities needed for successful TC. Developing internal sources of manufacturing capabilities is also a time-consuming and costly process that may take years. Once assembled, these capabilities should be kept current. Orga- nizational politics determine those capabilities to be upgraded, leading to inefﬁciencies. Overcoming these inefﬁciencies requires assembling capabili- ties from new internal or external sources. External manufacturing sources enable the ﬁrm to develop needed capabilities quickly, leading to ﬂexibility and reducing costs (Gil and de la Fe, 1999). Externally acquired capabilities do not always ﬁt the ﬁrm’s internal systems and processes Sources of Manufacturing Capabilities Internal External Human (H1) Technological (H3) Human (H2) Technological (H4) TC Frequency Speed Radicalness Patents Integration (H5a-H5d) Formal Informal Figure 1.

These changes can raise the cost of operations, create inefﬁciencies and slow down TC speed. Some external sources are also easier for outsiders to imitate. Excessive use of external sources can also reduce the investments in devel- oping internal manufacturing capabilities, which can weaken a ﬁrm’s competitive position (Lei, Hitt, and Bettis, 1996). These factors limit a ﬁrm’s potential gains from using external sources. Given the advantages and shortcomings of the various sources of manufacturing, there is a need to docu- ment their effects on TC success. Human resource (HR) sources internal manufacturing The HR component of capabilities usually includes the knowledge, exper- tise, talents, creativity, and skills of a ﬁrm’s man- ufacturing personnel (Cohen and Zysman, 1988; Davenport, 1992). The RBV posits that the unique skills and experiences of internally based manufac- turing personnel can give the ﬁrm a competitive advantage (Lado and Wilson, 1994). This ﬁrm- speciﬁc, tacit knowledge takes years to develop (Nonaka and Takeuchi, 1995), making it difﬁcult for others to copy those capabilities that embody this knowledge (Yeoh and Roth, 1999). Following the RBV, a ﬁrm should maintain strong internal HR-based manufacturing capabil- ities in order to gain a competitive advantage. This can be achieved by recruiting (Ettlie and Vel- lenga, 1979) and maintaining a well-trained labor force and managers whose knowledge, skills, and experience serve as a source of innovation within manufacturing (Leonard-Barton, 1995). Recruit- ment also gives the ﬁrm access to current tech- niques and knowledge. New employees’ skills are also honed through the experiences gained through learning by doing and the training the ﬁrm pro- vides. These experiences also improve TC suc- cess by facilitating the development of innova- tive products (Yeoh and Roth, 1999). Ettlie and Vallenga (1979) have shown that new employ- ees bring new skills and knowledge to the ﬁrm. This knowledge can expedite the speedy adoption of innovative technologies, which facilitates rapid product development and expedites TC. As manu- facturing personnel gain experience, they become proﬁcient in developing new products that expe- dite TC. These improvements also enhance the efﬁciency of the TC process, allowing the ﬁrm to reach the market quickly. Skilled manufactur- ing personnel also help the company by reduc- ing costs, eliminating waste, and shortening the product development cycle. They also enhance the ﬂexibility of a ﬁrm’s manufacturing operations by adjusting its new product speciﬁcations and expe- diting TC cycles (Sanchez, 1995). Experienced and well-trained employees are also better equipped to implement changes in the internal processes, sys- tems, and technologies needed for successful TC (Dertouzos et al., 1988). Therefore: Hypothesis 1: Use of internal HR-based manu- facturing sources leads to successful TC. Some HR-based manufacturing capabilities are assembled from external sources (Figure 1) by joining strategic alliances, employing consultants and outside experts, or maintaining close ties with universities and other research centers (Ragatz et al., 1997). External sources ﬁll serious voids in the ﬁrm’s internal manufacturing sources (Teece, 1986), thereby promoting successful TC (Leonard- Barton, 1995). The RBV holds that a ﬁrm’s ability to develop innovative and different uses of external sources can become a source of competitive advantage. A company can deploy its external manufactur- ing sources in ways that expedite TC. Kamath and Liker (1994) note that the early involvement of suppliers and exploitation of their skills have helped several leading U.S. and Japanese compa- nies succeed in TC. Suppliers also improve TC success by expanding the company’s knowledge base (Quinn and Hilmer, 1994). Inputs from sup- pliers also enable the ﬁrm to focus TC activities on those sources that add value to new products while expediting TC (Dyer, 1996). Interactions with sup- pliers and other external groups also improve the manufacturing function’s learning about the indus- try’s best practices and applying them to TC, which would enhance the ﬁrm’s knowledge base and TC speed. Therefore: Hypothesis 2: Use of external HR-based manu- facturing sources leads to successful TC. Technology-based manufacturing sources A key source of manufacturing capabilities is the ﬁrm’s technological core, systems, assets, and Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002) Capabilities and Technology Commercialization 381 resources (Figure 1). Japanese and Korean compa- nies’ success in TC has been attributed, in part, to the major improvements they have made in modernizing their manufacturing technologies and processes (Kodama, 1995). Companies that use modern manufacturing technologies are successful in TC (Dertouzos et al., 1988). Modern technolo- gies give the ﬁrm ﬂexibility to manufacture differ- ent products and upgrade existing ones (Sanchez, 1995). They also foster other types of ﬂexibility that expedite TC (Cohen and Zysman, 1988). The RBV proposes that companies that make effective use of modern technologies develop unique prod- ucts and therefore gain a competitive advantage. Modern manufacturing technologies also enable a ﬁrm to achieve economies of scope and increase the variety of their products while simultane- ously reducing costs through economies of scale (Sanchez, 1995). These economies ‘exist where multiple products can be more cheaply produced in combination than separately’ (Jelinek and Gold- har, 1983: 29). New technologies also facilitate the rapid sharing of information in the TC process, which improves TC speed and efﬁciency. Follow- ing the RBV, innovative technologies are expected to promote successful TC. Therefore: Hypothesis 3: Use of internal technical manu- facturing sources leads to successful TC. A ﬁrm can also use external sources to obtain modern manufacturing technologies (Lambe and Spekman, 1997), as noted in Figure 1. The RBV suggests that these technologies enable the ﬁrm to create differentiated products or lower costs. Sourcing can also reduce investing in the devel- opment of the company’s internal manufacturing base. Using licensing and outsourcing arrange- ments gives the company access to highly spe- cialized technologies or processes and standard- ized components. External sources can also reduce the costs and the time associated with TC, while encouraging suppliers to upgrade their techno- logical base (Dyer, 1996). Similarly, outsourcing or licensing agreements give the ﬁrm access to several components or manufacturing processes, which would enhance TC success by exploiting the suppliers’ technologies and knowledge (Bettis, Bradley, and Hamel, 1992). Therefore: Hypothesis 4: Use of external technical manu- facturing sources leads to successful TC. The moderating effect of integration Integration is the process by which the ﬁrm coor- dinates and deploys its different manufacturing sources in order to achieve successful TC (Grant, 1991). It includes the approaches, systems, and processes management uses to involve the ﬁrm’s manufacturing staff in the TC process (Song et al., 1997). This process centers on the deployment and use of the different internal and external manufacturing sources within TC. Integration is a conceptually distinct process from other inter- nal manufacturing-related decisions (e.g., machine selection), activities or, capabilities that inﬂuence TC success. These variables typically fall under the input side of the manufacturing process, are func- tionally based, and relate to production activities. They also demand specialized knowledge bases. Iansiti and Clark (1994) propose that the integra- tion of internal and external sources is positively associated with successful TC. However, some companies that excel in developing their manu- facturing sources and creating important capabili- ties fail in TC because of ineffective integration. Manufacturing integration promotes and cultivates cross-functional skills while understanding the TC task(s), considering when and how to involve the manufacturing staff, and selecting effective ways to harmonize the work of different functions asso- ciated with TC. This process requires political savvy and strong communication, and is usually grounded in a ﬁrm’s culture and the trust that prevails among its units and employees. Integra- tion corresponds to the transformation (through- put) of the ﬁrm’s sources within its manufacturing operations. Some companies succeed in obtaining man- ufacturing resources from internal and external sources but fail to gain the full beneﬁts of these inputs because they do not effectively integrate their manufacturing sources into TC (Ettlie, 1988). Organizational culture, politics, lack of experi- ence, and poor management may cause this fail- ure to integrate different manufacturing sources the abundance of manufactur- into TC. Thus, ing resources does not guarantee that the ﬁrm will excel in, or practice, effective manufactur- ing integration (Hitt, Hoskisson, and Nixon, 1993). Conversely, other companies with limited inter- nal sources have maximized their ﬁnancial gains from TC through effective integration (Song et al., 1997). Still, companies with developed internal Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002) 382 S. A. Zahra and A. P. Nielsen manufacturing sources may tightly integrate the various functions within their operations, improv- ing the efﬁcient use of the resources employed to develop capabilities. These capabilities are mul- tifaceted and some may not relate directly to TC. The effect of this dynamic interplay between resources and integration within the manufacturing unit becomes evident in the long run (5 years or longer), rather than within this study’s time frame. Consequently, in this study, internal sources and integration are treated as independent constructs because of our focus on the use of different man- ufacturing sources, rather than their creation.1 Figure 1 suggests that the contribution of man- ufacturing integration to the success of TC will be greater when integration is high, rather than when it is low (e.g., Ettlie, 1995; Ettlie and Reza, 1992). Effective integration starts at the earliest stages (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi, 1995) and con- tinues through the entire TC process. The early integration of manufacturing sources into the TC process is important because a large percentage of manufacturing costs (Whitney, 1988), and the fea- tures and quality of new products are determined early in the design stage. Integration also reduces slack within the TC process (Stalk and Hout, 1990) and provides the manufacturing staff with informa- tion that improves capacity planning and machine layout decisions (Leonard-Barton, 1992), ensur- ing TC success. Integration also improves learning (Iansiti and West, 1997) and makes the overlapping of the different internal and external manufacturing sources within TC possible, expediting TC. When integration of manufacturing sources in TC is high, the alignment of different internal and external sources with product speciﬁcations will be stronger than when integration is low (Kahn, 1996). This ensures a problem-free transfer of new product designs into manufacturing, promot- ing efﬁcient and speedy TC. When integration is high, the manufacturing staff can also contribute to successful TC by: developing ideas for new products using existing and untapped capabilities, serving as a learning laboratory for the TC team (Iansiti, 1995), and reducing costs while improving manufacturability (Gerwin, 1993). Integration also improves coordination among the various groups involved in the TC process. It increases intergroup interactions (Kahn, 1996) and encourages joint problem solving and own- ership and cross-learning, leading to successful TC (Ettlie, 1995). Collaboration facilitates the learning of tacit knowledge, which is ﬁrm spe- ciﬁc. This learning can increase the ﬁrm’s inno- vation, expedite new product development, and enhance the radicalness of the ﬁrm’s new prod- ucts. Integration also synchronizes external and internal manufacturing sources (Leonard-Barton, 1995), improving the ﬁrm’s ability to customize its externally acquired components in ways that differentiate its products from those of the com- petition. Customization allows the ﬁrm to create unique technologies that are hard for rivals to imi- tate. Therefore: Hypothesis 5a: The effect of internal HR sources on TC success is signiﬁcantly higher when inte- gration is high rather than when it is low. Hypothesis 5b: The effect of external HR sources on TC success is signiﬁcantly higher when inte- gration is high rather than when it is low. Hypothesis 5c: The effect of internal manufac- turing technology sources on TC success is sig- niﬁcantly higher when integration is high rather than when it is low. Hypothesis 5d: The effect of external manufac- turing technology sources on TC success is sig- niﬁcantly higher when integration is high rather than when it is low. METHOD 1 The RBV supports the separation of these two constructs (Teece et al., 1997). Prior researchers (Ettlie and Reza, 1992; Leonard- Barton, 1995; Song et al., 1997) also discussed these concepts as separate constructs, which is consistent with this study’s position. Further, as reported later, the simple correlations among measures of integration and sources of capabilities were modest, with the highest simple correlation being 0.24. Further, we ran an orthogonal factor analysis with the measures of integration and internal sources to establish the distinctiveness of these variables. The multiple measures, as reported later, emerged as separate factors, suggesting that integration and internal sources were two different constructs. Sample To test the hypotheses, data were collected using two mail surveys (conducted in 1996 and 1999), which were supplemented and validated with sec- ondary data. Initially, we identiﬁed the names of 600 established companies. Deﬁned at the 4- digit SICs, 20 U.S.-based industries were cho- sen because of their differences in manufacturing Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002) Capabilities and Technology Commercialization 383 innovation rates, and proﬁtability. technologies, These variations were desirable in order to provide a valid test of the hypotheses. Two criteria were used in developing the sam- ple. First, to avoid problems arising from ‘liability of newness,’ a company had to be at least 5 years old. New companies may not have access to many external sources and often possess few internal resources, thereby constraining their TC efforts. These companies usually do not have signiﬁcant experiences in all phases of TC, possibly limiting their gains from TC. Second, given that the need for integration increases as the ﬁrm’s size grows, a company also had to have at least ﬁve employees in order to minimize the effects of extremely small company size. Larger companies often have multi- ple product lines, use multiple external sources and maintain a specialized labor force, making inte- gration necessary. Very small ﬁrms may not face these issues or have the resources or the established relationships necessary to gain access to external manufacturing sources. Names and addresses of companies and their senior executives were obtained from multiple sources including Lexis-Nexis, companies’ annual reports, and Business Week 1000. Surveys were mailed to each company’s chief executive ofﬁ- cer (CEO) or highest-ranking ofﬁcial, who were the most knowledgeable about his/her ﬁrms’ man- ufacturing operations (Gerwin, 1993; Hitt and Ire- land, 1985) and innovation (Hitt et al., 1996). In the 1996 survey, two mailings were used. Of the 600 surveys mailed out, 23 were undeliv- erable. Completed responses were received from 149 companies, for a response rate of 25.82 per- cent. This response rate compared favorably with those achieved in similar studies (e.g., Gupta and Somers, 1996). The 1999 survey consisted of a single-page questionnaire that targeted those com- panies that responded to the 1996 survey. Three mailings, combined with follow-up calls and e- mails, yielded 97 completed responses. Sample representation We established the representativeness of the sam- ple by comparing responding and non-responding companies based on their age, size (full-time employees), and sales volume. t-Tests showed that the two groups did not differ signiﬁcantly in these variables. The χ 2 test also revealed that industry type and response to the survey were not signiﬁcantly associated. A χ 2 test of the association between company location (by state) and response to the survey was not signiﬁcant. Finally, t-tests compared early respondents to the 1996 survey (those that sent their questionnaire in within the ﬁrst 2 weeks) and later respondents (those that sent their replies within the third week or later). Early and later respondents did not dif- fer in their age, size (employees), or responses to the study’s variables. These analyses supported the representativeness of the sample. Similar analyses for the 1999 survey showed no signiﬁcant differ- ences by company age, size, or location. Testing for source bias We safeguarded against source bias by collecting data from secondary and primary sources. Data for three of the four dependent variables as well as company age, size, and industry type came from different secondary sources. Further, we conducted the ‘single factor’ test on the 1996 survey data, as done in some prior research (Simonin, 1999). A principal component factor analysis of responses to all survey items yielded 12 factors with eigenval- ues of 1.0 or higher. The analysis produced 12 fac- tors rather than one, indicating that source bias was not a serious concern (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986). Testing for inter-rater agreement In 1996, a second copy of the questionnaire was sent to the vice presidents for manufactur- ing operations (or equivalent) in each of the 149 responding companies. Completed responses were received from 67 manufacturing managers. These responses served to establish inter-rater reliabil- ity. We matched the data already received from their CEOs (or highest-ranking executives) with the responses of manufacturing managers, as done in prior studies (Hitt et al., 1996; Zahra and Covin, 1993). We repeated this process in 1999, generat- ing responses from two managers from 56 com- panies. Responses by the second executive were correlated with those of their ﬁrm’s CEOs (or highest-ranking executive) on the study’s variables using the 1996 (r = 0.65, n = 67, p < 0.001) and the 1999 (r = 0.67, n = 59, p < 0.001) surveys. This indicated a signiﬁcant inter-rater reliability on the study’s key variables. Data collected from the ﬁrst (primary) respondents were used in the anal- yses. Finally, where possible, secondary data were Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002) 384 S. A. Zahra and A. P.

This analysis showed positive and signiﬁcant associations, supporting the validity of the measures. The results of this procedure are described next. innovation (Narin, Noma, and Perry, 1987), hence the knowledge created through TC. However, patent counts did not separate signiﬁcant from incremental innovations. Also, some patents did not generate new products (DeCarolis and Deeds, 1999). Measures The dependent variables were measured and aver- aged over the 1997–99 period. The independent and control variables were measured over the pre- ceding 3-year period. Dependent variables We collected data for four TC measures: the num- ber of new products, number of radical new prod- ucts, number of patents, and TC speed. Data for the ﬁrst three measures were gathered from secondary sources, whereas the data for TC speed came from the 1999 survey. Number of new products We measured this variable by the number of announcements of new product introductions each ﬁrm made over the 1997–99 period (e.g., Singh and Mitchell, 1996). The number of announcements came from Lexis-Nexis, a comprehensive research database (e.g., Anand and Khanna, 2000; Mitchell and Singh, 1996). We counted each product introduc- tion only once, even if it appeared in multiple announcements. Given the high risks, Radical new products costs, and rewards of radical new products (Cooper, 2000), we reclassiﬁed product announce- ments into radical vs. incremental (Chaney and Devinney, 1992; Devinney, 1992). Following past research (e.g., Kotabe and Swan, 1995), three MBA students independently reviewed all announcements related to a given product introduc- tion and rated it based on its radicalness (Cooper, 2000). Given that strong disagreements persisted on the classiﬁcation of 13 announcements, they were excluded from the analyses. We coded radi- cally new products as 1 and incremental products as zero. Number of patents We counted the number of a ﬁrm’s patents, using data from the U.S. Patent Ofﬁce. Data were available for 103 ﬁrms. Patents are an important measure of a company’s Data for this measure came from the TC speed 1999 survey. Following the literature (Buzzell and Gale, 1987), the survey asked managers, ‘Once your company has developed a new product, how long on average does it take your company to intro- duce it to the market?’ Respondents provided data in months. We validated this measure in two ways. First, using Lexis-Nexis we found references to the length of time it took some companies in the sam- ple to develop and introduce new products. Where information existed for more than one new prod- uct, we averaged the ﬁgures and used this average in the analysis. We correlated the information from secondary sources with the ﬁgures gathered by the 1999 survey (r = 0.71, n = 39, p < 0.001). Sec- ond, we correlated a statement in the 1999 survey with the ﬁgures that managers reported (in months) about the speed of their new product introduc- tions. The statement was, ‘Compared to its key competitors, our company has a shorter product development cycle’ (1 = strongly disagree vs. 5 = strongly agree). The correlation was positive and signiﬁcant (r = 0.81, n = 97, p < 0.001). Independent variable We measured internal and external manufacturing sources, as follows: Internal sources We measured internal manu- facturing sources by eight items that were extracted from the literature (e.g., Hitt and Ireland, 1985; Lee and Na, 1994). A varimax factor solution (with an orthogonal rotation) yielded two sig- niﬁcant factors, each with an eigenvalue above 1.0. As Table 1 shows, the two factors explained 56.03 percent of variance. The ﬁrst factor (ﬁve items, α = 0.73) indicated the existence of strong internal manufacturing-related HR skills among a ﬁrm’s management and employees (Snell and Dean, 1992). The second factor (three items, α = 0.67) showed the use of external consultants and temporary employees. Fourteen items, also extracted External sources from the literature (e.g., Dyer, 1996; Lambe and Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt.

An orthog- onal factor analysis (with a varimax rotation) of these items yielded three signiﬁcant factors. As Table 2 shows, each factor had an eigenvalue above 1.0. The three factors explained 66.11 per- cent of variance. The ﬁrst factor (ﬁve items, α = 0.74) showed the existence of strong internal manufacturing technological resources and facilities (Dertouzos et al., 1988). The second (ﬁve items, α = 0.70) captured the use of joint ventures and alliances in manufacturing (Kotabe and Swan, 1995). The third factor (four items, α = 0.68) showed a ﬁrm’s use of outsourcing and licensing (Quinn and Hilmer, 1994). Moderator variable We measured integration in TC by 11 items that were extracted from the literature (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi, 1995; Ettlie, 1995; Gerwin, 1993; Kahn, 1996; Kahn and McDonough, 1997; Ettlie and Reza, 1992). An orthogonal factor analysis with a varimax rotation yielded the three factors presented in Table 3. These three factors explained 70.21 percent of variance. The ﬁrst factor (ﬁve items, α = 0.82) captured the formal coordination between manufacturing and other functional units in TC (Rauscher and Smith, 1995). The second (three items, α = 0.73) indicated the involvement of manufacturing in TC (Leonard-Barton, 1992). The third factor (three items, α = 0.73) showed the existence of informal manufacturing coordination (Kahn, 1996; Kahn and McDonough, 1997). Control variables We controlled for a company’s size, age, industry, and past performance, as follows. The analysis controlled for a Company size impact company’s size because of its potential on new product introductions (Yeoh and Roth, 1999) and access to external sources (Mosakowski, 1991). Company size was measured by the com- pany’s full-time employees (e.g.,Yeoh and Roth, 1999). The analysis also controlled for Company age age because established companies had more access to external sources (Mosakowski, 1991) and engaged in frequent new product introductions and patenting (Deeds and Hill, 1996). Age was measured by the number of years a company has existed. The study controlled also for Industry type industry type, which could determine the com- panies’ technological opportunities (Ali, Kalwani, and Kovenock, 1993; Klevornick et al., 1995). Abundant technological opportunities might en- courage companies to develop a large number of new products. Industries also varied in the pay- off from speedy TC (Ali et al., 1993). They also differed in the extent of their use of internal vs. external sources (Teece, 1986); frequency of radi- cally new products (Kotabe and Swan, 1995); and TC speed (Schoonhoven, Eisenhardt, and Lyman, 1990). Industries were deﬁned at the 4-digit SIC level. To control for industry type, an industry’s average score on a given variable was subtracted from a Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat.

Industries (and 4-digit SICs) studied were: fabricated metals (3442, 3443, 3465), industrial machinery and equipment (3556, 3559), computers (3571, 3572, 3575), electronics and electric equip- ment (3621, 3652, 3663), transportation equipment (3711, 3721, 3724, 3728), and instruments and related products (3812, 3825, 3826, 3842, 3845). A company’s past Past company performance ﬁnancial performance was expected to increase the slack resources available for TC. When slack resources were abundant, companies were expected to develop radically new products and introduce them quickly to the market (Eisenhardt and Tabrizi, 1995), modernize their manufacturing base, attract qualiﬁed employees, spend more on employee training, and use different manufacturing sources. Slack resources were expected to promote radical innovation (Yeoh and Roth, 1999). The 3-year return on assets (ROA) was used as a control variable. ANALYSIS Table 4 presents the means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations for the study’s variables. These ﬁgures were based on data from 119 ﬁrms. Given that the need for integration increases with size, companies with less than 100 employees (n = 19) were excluded. Missing data further reduced the sample to 119. Table 4 suggests that the correlations among the dependent and indepen- dent variables were consistent with expectations. Regression diagnostics also revealed a lack of seri- ous multicollinearity among the variables. We used hierarchical multiple regression anal- ysis to test the hypotheses.

Scores for the following variables are logged: number of products, radical products, patents, venture size, and past performance. For N = 119, r has to be 0.164 or higher to be signiﬁcant (p < 0.05).

Step 2 included both the control and independent variables. In step 3, we added interaction terms to the previous model. We created these interaction terms by multiplying each moderator by the man- ufacturing sources. The signiﬁcance of changes in R2 between successive steps (e.g., ﬁrst vs. second) was also evaluated, as reported in Tables 5–8. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002) 388 S. A. Zahra and A. P. Nielsen Hypotheses 1–4 The analyses showed that use of internal HR man- ufacturing sources was positively and signiﬁcantly related to the number of new products (Table 5), radicalness of new products (Table 6), patents (Table 7), and TC speed (Table 8). These results supported Hypothesis 1. External HR manufacturing sources were also positively and signiﬁcantly related to the number of new products (Table 5) and TC speed (Table 8). These two results supported Hypothesis 2. How- ever, external HR sources were negatively related to the number of patents (Table 7) and radical- ness of new products (Table 6), which contradicted Hypothesis 2. Thus, the results partially supported Hypothesis 2. The use of internal technological sources (mea- sured by the ‘internal proprietary manufactur- ing technologies’) was positively and signiﬁcantly related to the number of new products (Table 5), radical new products (Table 6), patents (Table 7), and TC speed (Table 8). These results supported Hypothesis 3. Focusing on external technological sources, out- sourcing and alliances were positively and signif- icantly related to new product radicalness and TC speed. These results supported Hypothesis 4. Out- sourcing was signiﬁcantly but negatively associ- ated with product radicalness (Table 6) and patents (Table 7), contradicting Hypothesis 4. The use of alliances and joint ventures had positive but non- signiﬁcant signs with patents (Table 7) and TC radicalness (Table 8), also contradicting Hypothe- sis 4. The results partially supported Hypothesis 4. Hypothesis 5 The results supported the moderating effect of inte- gration, as indicated by the data from steps 3.1 through 3.3 in Tables 5–8. In all cases, adding the moderators signiﬁcantly improved the results from step 2 (p < 0.05). Also, 14 of the 15 moderat- ing relationships were signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) for the number of new products. Twelve of the 15 moderators were signiﬁcant at p < 0.05 and one at p < 0.10 with TC radicalness. Twelve moderators (out of 15) were also signiﬁcant (p < 0.05) in the case of patents. Hypothesis 5a suggested that the effect of inter- nal HR sources on TC will be signiﬁcantly higher under higher than lower integration. The results (Tables 5–8) strongly supported this prediction. All interaction terms for manufacturing involve- ment, formal coordination and informal coordina- tion with internal HR sources were statistically signiﬁcant with the number new products, radically new products, patents, and TC speed. Hypothesis 5b suggested that the effect of exter- nal HR sources on TC will be signiﬁcantly higher under higher than lower integration. The results (Tables 5–8) partially supported Hypothesis 5b. The three interaction terms for involvement, for- mal coordination and informal coordination with external HR sources were signiﬁcant with the number of new products. For TC radicalness, the interaction of involvement with external HR sources was signiﬁcant at p < 0.05, whereas the interaction term for informal coordination was marginally signiﬁcant (p < 0.10). The interaction term for formal coordination was not signiﬁcant. The results for patents (Table 7) also showed that only the interaction term for formal coordina- tion and external HR was signiﬁcant (p < 0.05). The interaction terms for involvement and infor- mal coordination were not signiﬁcant. For speed, two of the three interactions were signiﬁcant, the exception being the interaction term for informal coordination (Table 8). Hypothesis 5c posited that the effect of internal manufacturing sources on TC would be signiﬁ- cantly higher when integration was high than low. The results (Tables 5–8) uniformly supported this prediction. Whether the dependent variable was the number of products, radical products, patents, or TC speed, the interaction terms for involve- ment, formal coordination, and informal coordi- nation were signiﬁcant. Hypothesis 5d suggested that the effect of exter- nal manufacturing sources on TC would be sig- niﬁcantly higher when integration was high rather than low. The results supported this prediction. Tables 5–8 showed that 19 of the 24 interaction terms for involvement, formal coordination, and informal coordination were positive and signiﬁ- cant, validating our expectations. Nonsigniﬁcant interactions included alliances and joint ventures with informal coordination (Tables 5 and 6), and informal coordination and outsourcing (Table 7) with patents. For speed (Table 8), the four interac- tion terms for involvement and formal coordination were signiﬁcant, but the two interaction terms for informal coordination were not. Thus, with 79.2 percent of the interaction terms being positive and signiﬁcant, Hypothesis 5d was supported. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt.

The results suggest that strong internal tech- nical manufacturing capabilities lead to successful TC. Given these signiﬁcant results, investments in and the development of internal HR and techni- cal manufacturing sources should be a managerial priority. The analyses also highlight the importance of, and challenges associated with, using external HR manufacturing sources. These sources signiﬁcantly improve the number of new products and TC speed. Likewise, outsourcing and alliances facil- itate new product introductions and speedy TC. However, the results also show that ﬁrms might Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002) Capabilities and Technology Commercialization 393 have to trade off the radicalness of their new prod- ucts and patents as they intensify their product introductions and the speed of these introductions, especially when using external sources. Speciﬁ- cally, external HR sources are negatively associ- ated with TC radicalness and patents. The data also indicate that outsourcing is negatively related to new product radicalness and patents. Given that the number of patents and new product radicalness capture a ﬁrm’s ability to develop new knowl- edge, the negative coefﬁcients observed in this study signal a serious loss of proprietary knowl- edge because of a company’s reliance on external sources. Outsourcing and other external sources adversely inﬂuence the development of tacit and ﬁrm-speciﬁc knowledge necessary for radical inno- vation that yields new knowledge. In contrast, frequent new product introductions and speedy TC can be achieved through incremental product and process innovation. However, it takes time to acquire, assimilate, and deploy external knowl- edge. Transforming a ﬁrm from imitation to radical innovation also takes years to occur. Radical inno- vation and new knowledge creation also require considerable learning by doing to develop requi- site knowledge. External sources may not yield tacit knowledge, either because acquired items are standard components or are sold without sup- pliers’ sharing their knowledge with the ﬁrm. Tacit knowledge is not easily transferred in for- mal market transactions and substantial effort is needed to assimilate this knowledge (Zahra and George, 2002). Integration of capability sources Integration emerges as a strong and signif- icant moderator of the relationship between manufacturing sources and TC. Thus, the effect of the manufacturing sources on different TC dimen- sions is higher and signiﬁcant when integration is high. Three key points are evident from the results. First, both formal and informal integra- tion is important but the contributions of formal integration are clearly identiﬁable in this research. Informal coordination adds signiﬁcantly to the explanatory power in the regressions in two out of four cases (number of new products and radi- cally new products). 19 and 18 of the 20 interac- tion terms for involvement and formal coordina- tion, respectively, are signiﬁcant. Conversely, 12 of the 20 interactions for informal coordination are signiﬁcant. Formal coordination yields greater synergies between internal and external capability sources, which promotes TC. Second, the moderating effects of integration are also stronger for internal human and technologi- cal sources than external human and technological sources. All 12 interaction terms for internal and external HR sources are positive and signiﬁcant. Companies that develop internal HR and manu- facturing sources gain signiﬁcantly in TC, espe- cially when integration of manufacturing sources in TC is high. These ﬁrms can combine differ- ent resources and skills that increase the ﬁrm’s combinative knowledge that creates radically new products and patents and achieves speedy TC. Inte- gration of internal sources also yields the resource combinations and proprietary knowledge that facil- itate successful TC. Third, informal integration mechanisms do not help in assimilating external sources to the extent they do internal sources. 7 of the 12 interactions for external HR and 19 out of 24 interactions for external technological sources are positive and sig- niﬁcant, showing that integration of internal and external sources can be beneﬁcial in terms of TC. Some organizational cultures promote the shar- ing of knowledge among the ﬁrm’s units regard- ing internal sources. Common and well-understood routines that permeate organizational units also facilitate communication, generating combinative knowledge and fostering learning by doing. limit There are several factors that the role of informal integration in assimilating external sources. These sources often embody tacit and dif- ferent knowledge bases that are not easily compre- hended by the recipient ﬁrm. The use of multiple external sources also constrains a ﬁrm’s ability to decipher and understand the knowledge embedded in these sources. Informal integration also necessi- tates trust based on shared experiences and goals. The suppliers of some external sources do not fully understand or share the recipient ﬁrm’s goals, com- plicating the integration of different sources. Infor- mal, and often post hoc, integration may not sufﬁce to overcome these critical shortcomings. For exam- ple, though informal coordination may facilitate the sharing of sensitive information in alliances and joint ventures, it may not sufﬁce to integrate the knowledge gained from these transactions into the TC process. The above observations highlight the limits of transaction cost and RBV explanations of the Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002) 394 S. A. Zahra and A. P. Nielsen differential use of internal and external sources (Steensma and Corley, 2001). Transaction cost and RBV analyses usually ignore the role of a ﬁrm’s absorptive capacity in assimilating external sources of knowledge (Zahra and George, 2002). Reliance on economic criteria to make sourcing decisions also obscures the need for adaptation and learning in order to beneﬁt from externally acquired prod- ucts, components, or knowledge. Sourcing deci- sions should also recognize the importance and costs of organizational learning and the evolution of capabilities as an outcome of the various phases of the TC process. Limitations The above discussion urges caution in interpret- ing our results. Even though the sample represents its target population, it does not cover all U.S. manufacturing industries and the results may not apply to all sectors of the economy. The study has also examined the relationships between manufac- turing sources and integration with TC, ignoring other functions. The focus on the extent rather than the process of integration is another shortcoming. Finally, the study did not probe a company’s moti- vations for using different manufacturing sources. Still, the results make several contributions to the ﬁeld, as discussed below. Contributions to the literature Empirically, this article recognizes and measures four dimensions of TC. Prior research has exam- ined selected dimensions of TC, possibly overlook- ing the trade-offs that might exist among these dimensions. In contrast, this study provides a richer understanding of the relationships among these dimensions while setting the stage for exploring their inﬂuence on a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage and performance. Another contribution is link- ing internal and external manufacturing sources to the four TC dimensions and developing mea- sures of several internal and external manufac- turing sources as well as informal integration. A third contribution is using multiple data sources to gauge the study’s various constructs, while using a 3-year lag between the independent and depen- dent variables. This overcomes a limitation of prior research that has employed cross-sectional designs and used data gathered from a single respondent. The article also contributes to theory devel- opment. It examines manufacturing integration within TC, which is different from the integra- tion of the manufacturing function or unit into the ﬁrm’s planning or strategy formulation process. Focusing on integration moves us closer to where it can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial per- formance. Similarly, studying internal and external manufacturing sources has implications for con- ducting thoughtful analyses of a ﬁrm’s boundary decisions and the locus of its productive activi- ties, which is a fundamental issue in the study of strategy (Williamson, 1999). Further, though the concept of integration has commanded great inter- est in the literature, this study has analyzed the various formal and informal mechanisms that a ﬁrm can use to integrate various sources of knowl- edge with its TC process. The results inform future theory development on the efﬁciency of formal vs. informal integration mechanisms, especially in terms of their impact on TC. The article also highlights knowledge creation as an important dimension of TC, thereby connect- ing research on manufacturing capabilities with the knowledge-based view of the ﬁrm (Grant, 1998). Concerns have been raised about the boundaries and potential contributions of the RBV (Priem and Butler, 2001; Barney, 2001). Even though the article offers a test of the propositions of the RBV within the TC and manufacturing arena, its results show a need to go beyond this per- spective and investigate the role of knowledge in creating dynamic capabilities that foster suc- cessful TC. In particular, the article links TC dimensions with the growing literature on the knowledge-based theory of the ﬁrm. This article departs from the literature by suggesting that deci- sions related to TC and sourcing decisions should incorporate criteria that consider their potential effect on knowledge creation and exploitation. TC is a knowledge-intensive process that requires managers to consider internal or external resources based on their potential effects on a ﬁrm’s knowl- edge base (Lee, Lee, and Pennings, 2001). Managerial implications The results also highlight the importance of hav- ing strong internal manufacturing sources for suc- cessful TC. This requires patient investments to acquire new skills and upgrade existing ones. Strategic audits should also enable executives to Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 23: 377–398 (2002) Capabilities and Technology Commercialization 395 identify the ﬁrm’s internal resources and explore ways to develop the manufacturing capabilities that improve TC success. Managers need also to develop strong HR-based manufacturing skills that ensure successful TC. Internal HR sources improve learning by doing, yielding the tacit knowledge essential for TC. The strategic value of internal HR sources is further highlighted by the weak and negative associa- tions observed between external HR manufacturing sources and some of the TC measures. Exces- sive use of external HR manufacturing sources may also cause companies to lose opportunities to develop the proprietary and tacit knowledge needed to introduce radically new products. While the use of external sources is a competitive neces- sity today, managers should identify the critical resources and capabilities that should be developed internally. Integration also signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the num- ber and radicalness of a ﬁrm’s new products. It improves the contributions of the internal technical and HR manufacturing sources to TC and offsets some of the shortcomings of the external sources of technical and HR sources. Importantly, formal coordination is more important for TC success than informal coordination. Managers can establish the mechanisms that encourage the involvement of the ﬁrm’s manufacturing activities within TC by using specialized and cross-functional task forces that combine and coordinate the use of different man- ufacturing sources. Implications for future research Our analyses indicate that different internal and external manufacturing sources signiﬁcantly dif- ferentially inﬂuence TC dimensions. The four TC dimensions analyzed in this article offer different but complementary paths to various types of com- petitive advantages. The speciﬁc links between these four dimensions of TC and different sources of competitive advantages should be explored in future studies. Research on this issue can capture the complementarities (or trade-offs) that might exist among different TC dimensions. A formal meta-analysis of TC dimensions can also clarify the relationships among TC, integration, and com- pany performance. The distinction between internal and external sources is a thorny issue. With recent changes in the way ﬁrms assemble their diverse capabilities, we need to revise existing deﬁnitions of inter- nal vs. external sources. The complexity of the transactions involved and ownership systems that might exist in today’s business environments sug- gest that a new classiﬁcation of these sources would be beneﬁcial. Once such distinctions are made, researchers can examine the systems and processes employed to integrate internal and exter- nal sources and the factors that inﬂuence such inte- gration. Future research can also identify industry and ﬁrm-related factors that inﬂuence the inte- gration of internal and external sources of man- ufacturing capabilities. Finally, the processes by which this integration occurs within TC should be examined. Toward this end, the domain and measurement of integration should be clariﬁed and the contextual variables that inﬂuence the asso- ciations between integration and TC should be investigated. CONCLUSION for gaining market share, sources are important Technology commercialization is an important means satisfying customers’ needs and achieving proﬁtability. Our results show that a company’s internal human and technological for successful TC. Further, some external sources (both human and technological) are conducive to successful TC. The contributions of internal and external manufacturing sources, in particular, to TC increase signiﬁcantly with the use of formal from informal coordination in enhancing TC success is higher technological with internal empirical sources.
