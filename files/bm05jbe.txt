This paper analyzes the determinants of large UK corporate reputation within a sample of companies drawn from a diverse range of industries. We pay particular attention to the role that philan- thropic expenditures and policies may play in shaping the perceptions of companies among their stakeholders. Our ﬁndings highlight that companies which make higher levels of philanthropic expenditures have better reputations and that this eect varies signiﬁcantly across industries. Given that tend to reﬂect the ﬁnancial performance of organizations above other factors (Fryxell, G. E. and J.

It suggests that philanthropic expenditures may play a signiﬁcant role in stakeholder management and may, in particular, lead to stakeholders holding more positive impressions of philanthropic corporations. is KEY WORDS: corporate philanthropy, corporate rep- utation, corporate social responsibility Introduction that the suggests evidence Recent level of philanthropic donations made by large U.K. busi- nesses has grown signiﬁcantly over the last 20 years (Arulampalam and Stoneman, 1995; Campbell et al., 2002). The most recent statistics indicate that the largest 100 U.K. ﬁrms collectively contributed over £630 M in 2002/3, a rise of 26% on the previous year, and that the proportion of proﬁts given to charities by these companies approximately doubled between 2001 and 2003.1 The increasing importance of cor- porate philanthropy is reﬂected in the proliferation of recent articles in the academic literature, many of which chart the chronological development of cor- porate philanthropy in the United States or the United Kingdom or examine the correlates of philanthropy (Adams and Hardwick, 1998; Arulampalam and Stoneman, 1995; Bartkus et al., 2002; Campbell et al., 2002; Himmelstein, 1997; Moore, 1995; Porter and Kramer, 2002; Saiia, 2000, 2002; Saiia et al., 2003; Siefert et al., 2003). 30 Stephen Brammer and Andrew Millington A variety of motivations for ﬁrms making phil- anthropic donations have been advanced in the existing literature (see Siefert et al., 2003, pp. 195– 196 for a useful overview). Among these alternative motivations, a central path paints philanthropy both as a way for companies to demonstrate their social responsiveness to the communities in which they operate (Berman et al., 1999; Wood and Jones, 1995), and as an activity that stimulates goodwill towards companies within those communities. Ear- lier work has argued that corporate philanthropy inﬂuences the perceptions of the ﬁrm in the eyes of a including investors2, cus- variety of tomers3, suppliers, actual or potential employees, and the voluntary sector (Himmelstein, 1997; Saiia, et al., 2003; Smith, 1994). Philanthropic donations may, therefore, serve both the needs of communi- ties, and enhance the long-run ﬁnancial performance of the ﬁrm. stakeholders Corporate reputation, the collective opinion of an organization held by its stakeholders, has been identiﬁed as a construct of growing importance (Kitchen and Laurence, 2003; MacMillan et al., 2002). Among other factors, reputation has been identiﬁed as playing a signiﬁcant role in improving ﬁrm value (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Gregory, 1991), enhancing consumer perceptions of product quality (Grewal et al., 1998; Milgrom and Roberts, 1986), raising employee morale, productivity and improving recruitment and retention (Garbett, 1988; Gregory, 1991; Turban and Cable, 2003), and per- mitting access to cheaper capital (Beatty and Ritter, 1986). The existing literature has identiﬁed a close relationship between corporate reputational capital and social responsibility (e.g. Fryxell and Wang, 1994; McGuire et al., 1988) and has focused con- siderable attention on evaluating the meaning of reputational ranking chief among them) concluding that such indices ‘‘speak most directly to their ‘‘reputation’’ as an investment’’ (Fryxell and Wang, 1994, p. 13). (the Fortune indices In spite of the apparently strong orientation of commonly available metrics of corporate reputation towards the ﬁnancial performance of organizations, a small, but developing body of work has sought to understand the relationship between social respon- siveness and corporate reputation thus deﬁned. Fombrun and Shanley’s seminal study of the inﬂu- large US companies ences on the reputations of found that a positive association between corporate reputation and the level of corporate charitable donations and the presence of a separately endowed corporate charitable foundation (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). More recently, Williams and Barrett (2000) provide further evidence in support of a positive link between philanthropy and ﬁrm repu- tation. In addition, Williams and Barrett ﬁnd evi- dence that the link between philanthropy and reputation is stronger among companies that more frequently violate occupational health and safety and regulations, arguing that, among environmental other things, to be a means by which ﬁrms may partially restore their good name following the commission of illegal acts’’ (Williams and Barrett, 2000, p. 348). Notably, nei- ther Fombrun and Shanley (1990) nor Williams and Barrett (2000) permit the effect of philanthropy on ﬁrm reputation to vary across industries. ‘‘charitable giving appears This paper contributes to the developing stream of research that focuses on the relationship between corporate reputation and social philanthropy. Con- tributions from the social issues in management ﬁeld have argued that social responsiveness is a funda- mentally multidimensional construct that embodies a large and varied range of corporate behaviour in relation to its resources, processes and outputs (Carroll, 1979; Waddock and Graves, 1997; Wood, 1991). In the context of philanthropy, earlier work has primarily focused on the importance of cash giving by ﬁrms (Adams and Hardwick, 1998; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990; Navarro, 1988) but some work has begun to examine the signiﬁcance of both other forms of corporate resources and cor- porate policies concerning philanthropy (Brammer and Millington, 2003). Brammer and Millington (2003) highlight the signiﬁcant degree of variation across organizations in the existence and nature of policies that govern the distribution of philanthropic expenditures across stakeholder groups. As yet, empirical work has not examined the link between philanthropic expenditures and policies and corpo- rate reputation in any detail. Speciﬁcally, earlier studies have failed to account for the possible impacts of the diversity of community involvement policy in addition to the impact of the size of expenditures. This paper makes three contributions to the lit- erature. First, the analysis is the ﬁrst to distinguish level of philanthropic between the impact of Corporate Reputation and Philanthropy 31 expenditures and corporate policies concerning the focus of their philanthropic initiatives on corporate reputation. Given that policies offer some indication of the destination of philanthropic expenditures, the analysis investigates whether how ﬁrms manage their philanthropy affects their reputations. Second, in contrast to earlier studies, the analysis permits the impact of philanthropy upon reputation to vary across industries. Philanthropy is expected to have different impacts on reputation according to how closely it is linked to the social consequences of individual ﬁrms. Our analysis investigates whether philanthropy has a more signiﬁcant impact on the reputations of some ﬁrms than others. Third, the evidence presented is among the ﬁrst evidence concerning the drivers of corporate reputations in the U.K. context. Much of the existing literature in the reputation ﬁeld is U.S.-based, as are the only existing studies of the link between reputation and social performance; our study sheds some light on the extent to which regularities observed there are internationally robust. The paper is structured as follows. The next section discusses the determinants of ﬁrm reputation, paying particular attention to philanthropy and philanthropic policies. Section ‘‘Method’’ introduces the sample and data sources. Section ‘‘Results’’ re- ports the results of the empirical analysis before a ﬁnal section concludes. The determinants of corporate reputation In this section we develop a model of the inﬂuences on corporate reputation and outline a number of hypotheses. Our starting point is Fombrun and Shanley’s seminal model which hypothesises that corporate reputations ‘‘represent publics’ cumulative judgements of ﬁrms over time’’ which, in turn, hinge on ‘‘relative success in fulﬁlling the expecta- tions of multiple stakeholders’’ (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990, p. 235). Stakeholders are expected to have diverse preferences over ﬁrm actions, process and outcomes, and these ‘‘different publics attend to different features of ﬁrm’s performance’’ (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990, p. 235). From this it follows that a ﬁrm’s current reputation is related to the signals that publics have received, whether directly from the ﬁrm or via other information channels such as the media or stock markets, concerning its behaviours, and the congruence between ﬁrm behaviours and the preferences of (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). those publics Following Fombrun and Shanley (1990), we dif- ferentiate between various types of signals that rel- evant publics may receive concerning companies, and which may inﬂuence their perceptions of the ﬁrm. Such signals vary according to whether they originate within or outside the company and with respect to the type of information they contain. Our framework hypothesises that ﬁrm reputation in the eyes of stakeholders is related to signals concerning philanthropic activities, and to signals relating to ﬁnancial performance, ownership and board com- position, size, media visibility, and industry. We will discuss each of these in turn. Reputation and philanthropy Existing work has argued that social responsiveness can play a signiﬁcant role in promoting favourable relationships with primary stakeholder groups upon whom ‘‘the survival and continuing prosperity of the organization depends’’ (Clarkson, 1995, p. 107). Hillman and Keim (2001) argue that effective stakeholder management can create ‘‘intangible, socially complex resources that may enhance ﬁrms’ ability to outperform competitors in terms of long- term value creation’’ (Hillman and Keim, 2001, p. 127) and highlight communities as a key member of the group of primary stakeholders. Consistent with these views, a growing literature argues that phi- lanthropy plays a signiﬁcant role in establishing and developing favourable relationships with community stakeholders (Adams and Hardwick, 1998; Berman et al., 1999; Wood and Jones, 1995). The strength of the signal that such philanthropic activities send to stakeholders may be expected to have become stronger recently in the U.K., where increasingly detailed information concerning the philanthropic activities of leading companies has been made available through the national news media and through the publications of socially oriented pressure groups such as the PerCent Club and Business in the Community. The Guardian began publishing its ‘‘giving list’’, an examination of patterns of corporate in giving among the U.K.’s leading companies, 32 Stephen Brammer and Andrew Millington November 2001 with the stated aim of ‘‘naming and shaming’’ (The Guardian Giving List, 5th Novem- ber 2001, p. 2) British corporations into accepting increased responsibility. Therefore we hypothesise that social Hypothesis 1 There is a positive relationship between the level of a firm’s philanthropic expenditures and its reputation. trends stakeholders three societal Frooman (1999) argues that understanding the wants of is of primary importance when attempting to design organizational responses to them. Therefore, the reputational impact of phi- lanthropy may be expected to vary according to whether it is focused upon activities that are broadly congruent with the expectations and preferences of social stakeholders or not. Brammer and Millington (2003) highlight that are expected to play a role in shaping philanthropic activities of companies in the U.K. First, participa- tion in organized political and democratic activities has declined as evidenced by the decline in the level of electoral turnouts and the low the levels of membership of political parties by historical and international standards (Mair and van Biezen, 2001). Second, the signiﬁcant decline in recent decades in churchgoing, particularly among Christian churches. The Church of England has suffered a 27% fall in membership since 1980. A MORI poll in April 2000 reported that 50% of those interviewed never went to churches except for weddings and funerals and only 16% of those surveyed attended church at least once a fortnight. The decline in the importance of religion is particularly marked among the young, with only 54% of 18–24-year-old believing that Jesus actually lived compared to 80% of the over 65s. Third, the signiﬁcant growth in the perceived importance of social issues, particularly education, within society as evidenced by the growth in the proportion of opinion poll respondents highlighting education as one of the most signiﬁcant issues facing Britain from around 15% in 1990 to over 30% by 2000 (in fact, the proportion was as high as 49% around the time of the 1997 general election). These developments in social beliefs and preferences are expected to have conditioned the link between philanthropic expenditures and ﬁrm reputation such that the link is more strongly positive if ﬁrm phi- lanthropy programmes are consistent with these preferences in that they exclude political and reli- gious causes and prioritise educational causes. to them. from external Recent contributions have argued that in addi- tion to the, more usual, focus on pressure for social responsiveness stakeholder groups such as pressure groups and consumers, ﬁrms also face very considerable pressure from employee stakeholders concerning their CSR (Smith, 2003; Waddock et al., 2002). Recent survey evidence suggests that employees prefer to work for socially responsive organizations, and are more likely to be loyal In response to these pressures, organizations have developed a range of mecha- nisms by which they involve their employees in their social responsibility initiatives. Several of the most common of these concern corporate philan- thropy, including the operation of schemes that facilitate charitable giving by employees out of their salaries, the matching of such individual philan- thropic activities by companies, and support for employee volunteering. These initiatives are ex- pected to be positively related to ﬁrm reputation because they help to attract, retain, and motivate in turn, are expected to have employees which, beneﬁcial long-term effects on the organization. Based on these discussions, we hypothesise that: Hypothesis 2 Firms that involve employees in their philanthropic activities have better reputations. Hypothesis 3 that focus Firms their philanthropic expenditures upon causes that are congruent with broad societal preferences have better reputations. Industry environments vary according to the nature of salient social responsibility issues and, therefore, in terms of the expected corporate responses to those issues. For example, earlier empirical work has identiﬁed a number of sectors as having high envi- ronmental impacts, e.g. the metals, resources, paper and pulp, power generation, water, and chemicals sectors (Bowen, 2000; Clemens, 2001; Hoffman, 1999; Morris, 1997; Sharma, 1997; Sharma et al., Corporate Reputation and Philanthropy 33 In contrast, other industries, particularly 1999). newer manufacturing industries and the service sector have signiﬁcantly lower environmental im- pacts and are associated with fewer highly visible environmental issues. Other industries are associated with alternative issues, for example, the tobacco and alcoholic drinks industries are associated with highly visible social issues. They are thought to produce large social externalities (e.g. crime and health) and are subject to strong regulatory regimes (competi- tion, safety and taxation). Similarly, the defence and pharmaceutical industries are subject to considerable pressure from ethical pressure groups and the proﬁle of workplace health and safety concerns is higher in the construction and resource extraction sectors. We propose that the perceived relatedness between philanthropy and the prevailing responsibility issues in a ﬁrm’s industry conditions the relationship between philanthropy and reputation. Philanthropy should arguably have a lower impact on ﬁrm reputation in industries with signiﬁcant environmental impacts because it fails to address the primary concerns of stakeholder groups (i.e. to reduce environmental impacts). For this reason, it may also be that, in these industries, philanthropy is viewed as a waste of cor- porate resources, thus incurring the displeasure of ﬁnancial, as well as societal, stakeholders. In other industries, philanthropy can be seen to bear a much more direct relationship to the social externalities generated by businesses. Funding alcohol awareness programmes, drug rehabilitation schemes, and other community initiatives is more likely to be interpreted by stakeholders as a direct form of atonement for the harmful side-effects involved in their commercial activities. For ﬁrms in these industries, philanthropy is signiﬁcantly more likely to provide a reputational payoff. Therefore we hypothesise that Hypothesis 4 The link between reputation and philanthropy is stronger social externalities that have significant in industries such signals arise out of accounting data or stem from movements in stock prices (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). Strong ﬁnancial performance may be inter- preted by external agents as a signal of effective corporate strategy, good management, and good resource allocations, and is therefore expected to help a ﬁrm establish or maintain a good reputation particularly among groups of ﬁnancial stakeholders such as creditors, investors, and external analysts that make use of such data (Fama, 1970; Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). In addition, the impressions, assess- ments and reports of these, comparatively well informed stakeholders, are expected to inﬂuence the perceptions of companies in the eyes of other groups of stakeholders (Shrum and Wuthnow, 1988). Fur- thermore, since many of the important inﬂuences on reputation are embedded within the ﬁrm (Dowling, 2001), external agents may ‘‘rely on previous ﬁnancial performance outcomes as signals of a ﬁrm’s overall esteem’’ (Roberts and Dowling, 2002, p. 1079). This that ﬁnancial performance attributes may play both direct and indirect roles in inﬂuencing the perceptions of a variety of agents concerning ﬁrm reputations. Consistent with this view, an extensive empirical literature ﬁnds evidence of a positive association between reputation and ﬁnancial performance characteristics, although the direction of causality appears to be ambiguous (see Roberts and Dowling, 2002; Sabate and Puente, 2003). While external agents view ﬁnancially suc- cessful companies favourably, they tend to be risk- averse and therefore of two ﬁrms exhibiting similar levels of ﬁnancial performance, it should be the ﬁrm that appears to offer less risk that gains the better reputation (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990). Such market risks may be linked to industry and may be related to corporate leverage since more indebted companies may face higher levels of insolvency risks. suggests Hypothesis 5 The better is a firm’s current financial performance, the better its reputation. Financial performance and corporate reputations Hypothesis 6 Corporate reputation is partly formed by signals concerning current ﬁnancial performance whether The greater is a firm’s market risk, the worse its rep- utation. 34 Stephen Brammer and Andrew Millington Hypothesis 7 The greater is a firm’s degree of leverage, the worse its reputation. Ownership characteristics, board composition, and reputation Recent evidence suggests that ownership exerts a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on a diverse range of phenomena including impacts on ﬁrm ﬁnancial performance (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997; Thomsen and Pedersen, 2000), strategic decisions concerning internationali- zation and diversiﬁcation (Tihanyi et al., 2003), ﬁrm R&D and innovation (Bushee, 1998; David et al., 2001), CEO compensation (David et al., 1998), and their inﬂuence on corporate social performance (Graves and Waddock, 1994; Johnson and Greening, 1999). Institutional investors have been motivated to become more engaged with corporate management because of their increased visibility and because they are ‘‘tied in’’ to their investments in the sense that, given their size, they have reduced ﬂexibility sell investments without signiﬁcantly damaging their value (Ryan and Schneider, 2002). If this is the case, the dissatisﬁed institutional investor has an incentive to seek modiﬁcation of corporate strategy (rather than sell-up), and management has an incentive to give such a request due heed. Thus, it is avoidance of a mutually damaging outcome, the drop in share price, that grants institutions a position of inﬂuence. The presence of signiﬁcant institutional shareholdings may therefore send a strong signal to other stakeholders that poor corporate performance will not be toler- ated. This may, in turn, lead to a positive relationship between the extent of such ownership and ﬁrm reputation that arises both out of the positive inﬂu- ence of shareholder activism on ﬁrm performance and through the indirect mechanism of this signal inﬂu- encing the perceptions of other stakeholders. Board composition is also thought to play a key through the role in affecting ﬁrm behaviour introduction of increased diversity and via the import of agents who are more strongly aligned with external stakeholder interests than managers (Wang and Dewhirst, 1992; Zahra et al., 1993). The presence of outside directors may provide ‘additional windows on the world’ (Tricker, 1984, p. 171). Their role is to inform and advise execu- tive decision-makers, drawing upon specialist knowledge and/or experience. If this input con- tributes to the effectiveness of corporate strategy, as it is designed to, then it may also augment the company’s reputation. Hypothesis 8 The greater is the degree of long-term institutional ownership, the better is a firm’s reputation. Hypothesis 9 The more non-executive directors as firm has, the better its reputation. Firm size, media visibility and reputation the Broadly speaking, ﬁrms grow as a result of effectiveness of their corporate strategy, and so larger ﬁrms should be expected to have better reputations than smaller rivals because size is one measure of success. It is also relevant here that larger ﬁrms tend to be more visible to external agents. The larger scale of their activities makes more numerous and signif- icant their interactions with relevant external pub- lics. Thus, agents will tend to hold more information regarding the activities of larger ﬁrms, an imbalance which may bias their assessments of corporate rep- utation. The media acts as an agenda-setter, and not merely a mediator, in the relationship between companies and their stakeholders (Adler and Milne, 1997; Brown and Deegan, 1998). Media coverage ‘‘inﬂuences the preferences of the populace and helps set the public agenda’’ (Erﬂe and McMillan, 1990, p. 123). Organizational visibility affects per- ceptions of organizations both by the provision of information on speciﬁc issues and by introducing availability biases whereby ‘‘ﬁrms frequently and non-negatively touted by the media might therefore develop better reputations’’ (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990, p. 240). Thus, media exposure increases the stock of available information, and also sets the context within which it is viewed. For both reasons, one should expect the extent of media exposure to inﬂuence assessments of corporate reputation. Corporate Reputation and Philanthropy 35 Hypothesis 10 The larger the ﬁrm, the better its reputation. Hypothesis 11 A ﬁrm’s media exposure inﬂuences its reputation. Industry and reputation It may be that, even controlling for ﬁnancial per- formance and all the other ﬁrm attributes we have discussed, systematically across sectors. This is to say, some business activities may predispose a ﬁrm to a better reputation than do other activities. reputation varies Hypothesis 12 A firm’s reputation is partly determined by the nat- ure of its principle business activities. Method Sample is in our analysis The main data constraint the availability of data relating to corporate reputations. To measure corporate reputation we utilise the ‘‘Britain’s most admired companies’’ survey from Management Today, 2002. The Management Today reputational survey is very similar methodologically to the Fortune data often analysed in empirical work concerning corporate reputations. The chairmen, managing directors and selected main board directors of the 10 largest companies in 24 industrial sectors were surveyed, as were analysts at a selection of leading investment companies. Participants were asked to rate each company in their sector (exclud- ing their own company) on a scale of zero (poor) to 10 (excellent) for their performance in nine criteria: quality of management; ﬁnancial soundness; ability to attract, develop and retain top talent; quality of products/services; value as a long term investment; capacity to innovate; quality of marketing; com- munity and environmental responsibility; use of corporate assets. The assessments received for each ﬁrm were averaged across criteria and respondents to produce a single reputational score. This provides a reputational score (REPSCORE) for each of 240 U.K. PLCs. It should be noted that, because of the method employed in the construction of reputational data, these companies, while drawn from a wide range of industrial sectors, are not necessarily representative of the general run of eco- nomic activity in the U.K. In addition, the focus is clearly upon the ﬁrms with the most favourable reputations within each industrial sector. However, there is still considerable variation in the range of reputational scores both within and between indus- trial sectors and the scope of the sample embodies many of the largest ﬁrms in the U.K. including 90% of the FTSE 100. Data on philanthropic expenditures and policies The 1985 U.K. Companies Act obliges companies to disclose donations to charities of over 200 pounds in the directors’ report. Data on the level of phil- anthropic expenditures are therefore readily available in the U.K. context and were collected using Da- taStream. Using this data, we constructed a variable, CHARITY, which equals the level of ﬁrm philan- thropic giving in 2002 measured in thousands of pounds. Data concerning corporate community involvement policies was based primarily on pub- lished data. The Directory of Social Change (DSC) publishes a biennial Guide to U.K. Company Giving. The guide, designed as a tool for fundraising orga- nizations, provides detailed information relating to corporate charitable and community involvement policies and management on a ﬁrm by ﬁrm basis. The DSC compiles each ﬁrm’s entry in the guide by integrating ﬁnancial data from published annual reports with information obtained from a question- naire or studies have emphasized that the codiﬁcation of written CSR policy is only one form of corporate response to pressure responsibility (Robertson and Nicholson, 1996; Wood, 1991) and that policy commitments are not necessarily well correlated with implementation (Ryan, 1994). Nevertheless, several studies have used corporate interview survey. Earlier demonstrate to social 36 Stephen Brammer and Andrew Millington to make inferences concerning communications stakeholder and Nicholson, 1996) and the interface between CSR and corporate strategy (Moore, 1995). responsiveness (Robertson Each ﬁrm’s entry in the guide also provides a detailed breakdown of a range of policies concerning the ﬁrm’s community involvement activities. Spe- ciﬁcally, the guide describes the extent and nature of employee involvement in community activities and statements concerning prioritized and excluded areas of community involvement. These data were sup- plemented by information from two additional sources. First, the PerCent club publishes an annual benchmarking report with entries for each ﬁrm that returns a postal survey. In 1999, 115 PerCent club members participated in the benchmarking exercise. This report provides additional contextual and practical information relating to the participant’s community involvement. Secondly, an increasing number of ﬁrms disclose details of their community involvement directly through annual reports and websites. This material was used to supplement and validate other sources of data. Community involvement policies were analyzed through a number of binary variables that reﬂect the presence of corporate policies concerning philan- thropic activities. In the detailed discussions of their involvement policies many ﬁrms identiﬁed elements that involved their employees in the company’s activities. Typically, ﬁrms identiﬁed whether or not (a) operated a payroll giving scheme that they: facilitates by employees (PROWAGE), (b) matched individual donations to charity with company donations (PROMATCH), and (c) supported employee vol- unteering to community initiatives on company time (PROVOL). A binary variable was constructed for each of these dimensions which took a value of 1 if the company supported the particular initiative and zero otherwise. contributions direct to charity Areas of community involvement that were pri- oritized or excluded by ﬁrms were identiﬁed by examination of the ﬁrm’s detailed disclosures. Once again, a set of binary variables was constructed to facilitate analysis. The complete set of priorities and exclusions was established through open coding and subsequently restricted to the most commonly expressed preferences. Binary variables were con- structed that took a value of one if the ﬁrm excluded religious (ANTIREL) or political (ANTIPOL) causes from their community involvement and if they pri- oritized educational charities (PROED) for each identiﬁed priority or exclusion and zero otherwise. Data on other ﬁrm characteristics resources, the value of A measure of each ﬁrm’s size (SIZE) (the natural logarithm of total assets), principle activity (approximately equivalent to the three-digit NACE industry), the number of outside (non- executive) company directors (NONEXEC), ﬁrm proﬁtability (measured by the ratio of pre-tax proﬁts to total assets, ROTA), and corporate leverage (measured by the ratio of total debt to total assets, LEVERAGE) were extracted from accounting data courtesy of DataStream. Using the DataStream industry classiﬁcation, we allocated each ﬁrm to one of twelve sectors: business services, chemicals, con- struction, consumer products, engineering, ﬁnance, high technology, publishing, retail, transportation, utilities. We also created two dummy variables: SOCIAL took a value of one if the ﬁrm operated in an industry with signiﬁcant social externalities4 and zero otherwise, ENV5 took a value of one if the ﬁrm operated in an industry with sig- niﬁcant environmental impacts and zero otherwise. Much of the previous empirical work employs ﬁrm size as a measure of visibility to external agents (e.g. Adams and Hardwick, 1998; Bowen, 2000; Damanpour, 1987). However, as Bowen (2000) notes, organizational size is an unsatisfactory measure of organizational visibility because it captures much more than an organization’s visibility. Saiia (2000) argues that the use of a commonly accepted metric is necessary for consistent and replicable analysis of corporate visibility or exposure. He concludes that the best measures should incorporate readily avail- able secondary data. Consistent with these argu- ments, our approach is to use the incidence of news media coverage of the ﬁrm as a measure of visibil- ity6. This information was obtained form the Factiva database, which provides searchable archives of news content from over 8000 global sources. We gathered the calendar years 1998–2002 data for each of inclusive, and used the natural logarithm of the average number of annual news hits as our measure of corporate visibility (VISIBILTY). Corporate Reputation and Philanthropy 37 Data concerning the market performance of sample companies was obtained from Barra Inc, a leading risk specialist. We include BETA, a gauge of the expected response of a stock to the overall market, as a measure of the risks associated with stock ownership. Market perceptions concerning stock performance were captured through the inclusion of two composite variables obtained from Barra Inc. GROWTH is a variable that is based on two dimensions of corporate growth: growth in assets and earnings both measured over a 5 year period. VALUE is a composite variable that is based upon three performance ratios: earnings to price, book value to price, and cash ﬂow to price. High values of these ratios can signal the presence of assets that are currently undervalued by the market and can form the basis of trading strategy. Ownership data were drawn in June 2002 from a share ownership analysis database of more than 2000 listed U.K. ﬁrms managed by one of the U.K.’s largest company registrars. Ownership data is con- tinually updated to incorporate underlying beneﬁcial ownership changes and investment managers’ hold- ings from share trading information recorded daily on the London Stock Exchange. The database di- saggregates share ownership according to 32 differ- ent types of beneﬁcial owner. Following, Ryan and Schneider (2002) and Johnson and Greening (1999), we created a variable, LONGTERM, that equalled the sum of the proportion of ﬁrm equity held by long term institutional investors. Pension funds, insurance companies and life assurors were classiﬁed as long term investors. Results signiﬁcant Table I presents descriptive statistics and correlation coefﬁcients for the key variables. The magnitudes of the correlation coefﬁcients indicate that multicolin- earity is unlikely to present statistical difﬁculties. Table II reports the primary regression results. Reﬂecting our the dependent variable is the ﬁrm reputation score as reported in Management Today. Overall, the model explains approximately half of the variance in the dependent variable which is reasonable in the con- text of a cross-sectional model and is equivalent to the explanatory power of existing models. earlier discussion, Model 1 provides a point of departure with the existing literature by examining a set of explanatory variables roughly equivalent to those employed by Fombrun and Shanley (1990). Consistent with Fombrun and Shanley’s results, we ﬁnd that ﬁrm reputation is positively inﬂuenced by current ﬁnancial performance, as measured by proﬁtability (p = 0.031), with the degree of ownership by long- term ﬁnancial institutions (p = 0.0001), and with current market performance (as reﬂected by the positive coecient on GROWTH (p = 0.041) and the negative coecient on VALUE (p = 0.036)). These results provide further conﬁrmation of the ﬁndings of Fryxell and Wang (1994) which suggest that reputational indices are highly correlated with facets of corporate ﬁnancial performance. Contrary to Fombrun and Shanley (1990), we ﬁnd that cor- porate media visibility is strongly positively associ- ated with ﬁrm reputation (p = 0.016). to the introduction of Model 2 extends Model 1 by introducing a set of industry effects. Many of the results identiﬁed for Model 1 are robust the industry dummy variables, and the importance of controlling for industry discussed earlier is under- lined by the signiﬁcant variation in reputational scores across industries and the coincident leap in the explanatory power of the empirical model. Model 3 introduces the level of ﬁrm charitable donations as an explanatory variable and demonstrates that the level of ﬁrm donations is strongly positively associ- ated with ﬁrm reputation (p = 0.000). That chari- table activities appear to have a positive impact upon ﬁrm reputation is signiﬁcant given the strong emphasis of ﬁnancial performance within the con- struction of reputational indices (Fryxell and Wang, 1994) and may suggest that philanthropic activities are increasingly viewed as an important part of corporate responsibility strategies (Porter and Kra- mer, 2002; Saiia, 2000, 2002; Saiia et al., 2003). Model 47 develops Model 3 by including six variables that capture the most common policies that apply to corporate community involvement initia- tives in addition to the level of corporate donations. Broadly, that community involvement policies have no signiﬁcant impact upon corporate reputations. Neither, exclusions from unpopular religious or political afﬁliations nor prioritizations for educational causes or employee involvement initiatives seem to have any material the ﬁndings suggest 38

effect on ﬁrm reputation8. The exception is the signiﬁcantly negative effect of support for staff vol- unteering reputation (p = 0.044). Given that there is likely to be little direct beneﬁt to corporations of allowing their sta to volunteer during company time, this ﬁnding may suggest that such activities are viewed as a waste of corporate resources and, therefore, as being incom- patible with the ﬁnancial objectives of the ﬁrm. Model 5 extends the analysis further by intro- ducing two industry effects, ENV and SOCIAL, which reﬂect a ﬁrm’s activity in industries associated with signiﬁcant environmental or social externalities respectively. Model 5 also includes interaction terms between ﬁrm charitable donations and membership of these environmentally and socially damaging industries and therefore permits the impact upon reputation of being in a sensitive industry to vary with the level of corporate philanthropy. The results suggest that operating in an environmentally sensi- tive industry is not associated with a lower corporate reputation but that ﬁrms in industries with signiﬁ- cant social externalities have signiﬁcantly poorer reputations (p = 0.073). Furthermore, on average, the negative impact of operating in a socially dam- aging industry is equivalent to more than 10% of the mean reputational the negative reputational eect of operating in a socially damaging industry is found to be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the level of corporate philanthropic expenditures (p = 0.002) suggesting, that philanthropy helps to mitigate the negative reputational consequences of operating in controversial business sectors. This ﬁnding is consistent with Williams and Barrett’s (2000) evidence that the link between philanthropy and reputation is stronger among companies that more frequently violate occupational health and safety and environmental regulations. score. However, Discussion and conclusion This paper has analyzed the determinants of corpo- rate reputation within a sample of large U.K. com- panies drawn from a diverse range of industries. We have paid particular attention to the role that phil- anthropic expenditures and policies may play in shaping the perceptions of companies among their stakeholders. Our ﬁndings highlight that companies indices tend to reﬂect signiﬁcantly across which make higher levels of philanthropic expen- ditures have better reputations and that this effect industries. Given that varies reputational the ﬁnancial performance of organizations above other factors (Fryxell and Wang, 1994) and that elements of the literature emphasise that discretionary aspects of social responsibility, including corporate donations, may not be in the ﬁnancial interests of organizations (e.g. Friedman, 1970), this is a signiﬁcant ﬁnding. It suggests that philanthropic expenditures may play a signiﬁcant role in stakeholder management and may, in particular, lead to stakeholders holding more positive impressions of philanthropic corporations. Additionally, our analysis also suggests that the impact of philanthropic expenditures on corporate reputations is, to some extent, industry speciﬁc. We ﬁnd that philanthropy has a signiﬁcantly larger effect on reputations in industries that exhibit signiﬁcant social externalities, such as the alcoholic drink and tobacco sectors, than it does in other sectors. This suggests, consistent with the ﬁndings of Williams and Barrett (2000), that philanthropy may help compa- nies to atone for socially irresponsible behaviours and that these expenditures may help to protect corpo- rate reputations against these negative stakeholder perceptions. The fact that this effect doesn’t appear to operate within environmentally sensitive indus- tries may perceive philanthropy to be unrelated to environmental performance. stakeholders suggest that impact of the reputational Distinctively, our analysis permits us to evaluate whether corporate philanthropy is contingent upon two factors: (i) how the philanthropy is implemented – gifts in cash versus with the involvement of employees, and (ii) the destination of philanthropic expenditures. Concerning the ﬁrst issue, we ﬁnd that cash giving generates more signiﬁcant reputational payoffs than does involving employees through matched giving or volunteering. Therefore, our analysis suggests that ﬁrms seeking to maximise the reputational impacts should make more cash donations. This observation is consistent with the external bias present in the construction of reputational data such as those we have analysed. Employee involvement initiatives appear not to inﬂuence the perceptions of the ﬁrm in the eyes of external stakeholders but might play a signiﬁcant role in motivating internal stakeholders Corporate Reputation and Philanthropy 41 (Peterson, 2004). Future work might explore these issues in more detail. Turning to the destination of philanthropic expenditures, we ﬁnd no strong evidence that community involvement policies have any direct or indirect effect on corporate reputation; neither fail- ing to exclude unpopular causes, nor including popular ones appears to have any impact on repu- tation. There is much discussion in the voluntary sector about the relationships between companies and charitable organizations that centres on the dif- ference between attractive and unattractive (viewed from the perspective of companies) causes and highlights that many worthy, but unattractive causes, ﬁnd it very difﬁcult to attract corporate funding. Perhaps, in light of our ﬁndings, ﬁrms can be more conﬁdent about supporting unpopular or unattrac- tive causes given that there is no reputational loss associated with doing so. In other respects, our ﬁndings are consistent with elements of the existing literature. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd evidence that ﬁrm reputation is positively inﬂuenced by current ﬁnancial performance (whe- ther measure by accounting or market methods), and with the degree of ownership by long-term ﬁnancial institutions. We also ﬁnd that reputations vary sys- tematically across industries, conﬁrming the need to control for industry in studies of reputation, partic- ularly when operationalizations of reputation are industry speciﬁc in the sense that respondents are asked to rate ﬁrms relative to industry peers (Fombrun and Shanley, 1990) This study suffers from limitations that could be addressed in future work. First, our analysis is cross- sectional in nature and future attempts to examine the patterns we have identiﬁed within a longitudinal framework would both help to resolve remaining issues concerning causality and shed more light on the evolving relationship between philanthropy and reputation among U.K. ﬁrms. Second, our study, in common with much of the empirical work in the area conducted in the U.K., would beneﬁt from the improved availability of data, particularly in the context of measuring corporate reputation that would permit richer analyses. We would welcome the availability of reputational data that is consis- tently available for a large sample of companies that is derived from alternative methodologies, such as those proposed by Gardberg and Fombrun (2002). Notes 1 See The Guardian’s 2003 Giving List. 2 Making in excess of £50,000 per year in charitable donations is a condition of membership of the FTSE4 Good index, the ﬁrst socially responsible investment in- dex launched in the U.K. 3 Nearly a third of British consumers had bought a product or service because the ﬁrm had a link with a char- itable organization (Business in the Community, 2001) 4 The alcoholic beverage, tobacco, defence and phar- maceutical industries were deﬁned as having signiﬁcant social externalities. 5 The chemical, resource extraction, and utilities sectors were deﬁned as having high environmental impacts. 6 Meznar and Nigh (1995) adopt a similar approach to measuring organizational visibility. They measured visi- bility as the number of stories concerning a ﬁrm in ﬁve US national daily newspapers over a 15 month period. They speciﬁcally excluded the Wall Street Journal from this list because ‘‘of its strong emphasis on economic is- sues’’ (Meznar and Nigh, 1995, p. 983). 7 The number of observations falls signiﬁcantly (from around 200 to 140) when the policy variables are intro- duced. We conducted consistency checks to ensure that other results were robust to the reduction in sample size, but preferred to report the results for the largest samples available because of the increase in degrees of freedom. 8 We estimated alternative variants of the model that permitted the impact of policies to vary across different ﬁrm sizes and for different levels of corporate philan- thropy, but, perhaps because of the reduction in the number of degrees of freedom, no signiﬁcant patterns were identiﬁed.
