We integrate institutional theory with research on corporate political strategy to develop a political dependence model that explains (a) how different types of dependency on the government lead ﬁrms to issue corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports and (b) how the risk of governmental monitoring affects the extent to which CSR reports are symbolic or substantive. First, we examine how ﬁrm characteristics reﬂecting dependence on the government—including private versus state ownership, executives serving on political councils, political legacy, and ﬁnancial resources—affect the likelihood of ﬁrms issuing CSR reports. Second, we focus on the symbolic nature of CSR reporting and how variance in the risk of government monitoring through channels such as bureaucratic embeddedness and regional government institutional devel- opment inﬂuences the extent to which CSR communications are symbolically decoupled from substantive CSR activities. Our database includes all CSR reports issued by the approximately 1,600 publicly listed Chinese ﬁrms between 2006 and 2009. Our hypotheses are generally supported. The political perspective we develop contributes to organizational theory by showing that (a) government signaling is an important mechanism of political inﬂuence, (b) different types of dependency on the government expose ﬁrms to different types of legitimacy pressure, and (c) ﬁrms face a decoupling risk that makes them more likely to enact substantive CSR actions in situations in which they are likely to be monitored.

Introduction The implications and antecedents of ﬁrms’ political strategies have emerged as important areas of research in organizational theory (Bonardi et al. 2005, Hillman et al. 2004). Governments control critical resources that shape ﬁrms’ competitive positions, for example, through regulations affecting an industry or through tax poli- cies favoring certain regions (Baron 1995, Schuler and Rehbein 1997). Scholars have identiﬁed a number of ways that ﬁrms act strategically in managing their rela- tionships with governmental actors, including political activities such as lobbying, establishing political action committees (PACs), and advocacy or testimony on key issues (Hillman 2003, Hillman et al. 2004, Lord 2000, Mizruchi 1992, Quasney 2003). Whereas this research has focused on how ﬁrms work to actively shape govern- ment rule-making processes, other research has shown that in addition to setting rules and engaging in coer- cive processes, governments also use signaling processes to create norms and standards of legitimacy for ﬁrms (Dobbin and Sutton 1998; Dobbin et al. 1993; Edelman 1990, 1992). Yet research on corporate political strategy has not, to our knowledge, addressed how and why ﬁrms respond strategically to government signals. In this paper, we investigate the factors that render a ﬁrm more or less likely to adhere to government signals in an effort to shape perceptions of its political legiti- macy, which we deﬁne as the extent to which the gov- ernment views the ﬁrm’s actions as being in accordance with norms and laws. Consistent with work on corpo- rate political strategy proposing that ﬁrms seek present or future resources from governments, we view politi- cal legitimacy, which is associated with greater access to government resources, as a strategic resource for ﬁrms (Hillman 2005, Li and Zhang 2007, Peng and Luo 2000, Pfeffer and Salancik 1978). Furthermore, this resource may be especially important in emerging economies where weak formal institutions can lead ﬁrms to rely more on informal mechanisms (La Porta et al. 1998, Peng and Heath 1996). The political response model we develop focuses on two key factors that shape a ﬁrm’s response to government signals: political depen- dence and government monitoring. If adhering to government signals results from a ﬁrm’s desire to appear more legitimate to the gov- ernment, then it is important to recognize that ﬁrms vary in their dependence on governmental actors and that this variation should inﬂuence their responses to 127 OrganizationScienceDownloaded from informs.org by [131.193.251.47] on 02 August 2017, at 16:17 .

Organization Science 25(1), pp. 127–148, © 2014 INFORMS government signals. Speciﬁcally, we examine how key features of a ﬁrm’s political embeddedness that shape its need for legitimacy—e.g., state versus private own- ership (Chen 2007, Li and Zhang 2007), network con- nections to national political congresses (Hillman 2005, Ma and Parish 2006), political legacy (Kriauciunas and Kale 2006, Marquis and Huang 2010), and ﬁnancial resources—result in ﬁrms being more or less likely to follow government signals. However, research has also found that such legitimacy pressures can result in decoupling processes whereby corporate responses to external demands vary in the extent to which they are symbolic or substantive (Meyer and Rowan 1977, Okhmatovskiy and David 2012, Oliver 1991). In this paper, we also explore the extent to which symbolic action in response to government sig- nals depends on the likelihood of a ﬁrm being moni- tored by governmental actors. Research on decoupling has shown that the implementation of symbolic strate- gies is typically not monitored by stakeholders (Zajac and Westphal 2004). We introduce the notion that ﬁrms face a “decoupling risk” if they respond only symboli- cally to government signals: exposure of the decoupling may harm the ﬁrm. Speciﬁcally, we argue that a combi- nation of (a) a ﬁrm’s bureaucratic embeddedness, i.e., its network connections within the government bureaucracy as opposed to its connections to national congresses (Fan et al. 2007), and (b) regional government insti- tutional development (Brandt and Li 2003, Goldstein 1995) subject the ﬁrm to more government monitor- ing. We focus on why highly monitored ﬁrms that are at greater risk of having symbolic action exposed are more likely to adhere substantively to government sig- nals. Figure 1 describes the general model we propose and the context-speciﬁc factors that we elaborate in our hypotheses below. Our empirical context is the introduction and spread of corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting among all publicly listed Chinese ﬁrms from 2006 to 2009. This context is in many ways ideal to study the issues of interest. First, it is an activity that the Chinese govern- ment has been actively signaling to ﬁrms as legitimate and important. Since 2006, when China’s 11th Five-Year Plan initiated the idea that China should pursue a more “harmonious society,” the central government has issued a number of CSR reporting guidelines for large ﬁrms as a strategy to help balance China’s extensive economic growth with the social and environmental effects of that growth (See 2009). It is important to note that these gov- ernmental issuances are not speciﬁc laws or mandates but are examples of a government signaling what it con- siders to be an important area of corporate focus. As of 2009, Chinese ﬁrms issued over 15% of the world’s CSR reports, yet there is signiﬁcant variation across Chinese ﬁrms in the amount of information dis- closed on speciﬁc CSR activities (China WTO Tribune 2009). This variation allows us to determine the extent to which the reports are purely symbolic exercises or indica- tive of substantive CSR activities. In the political econ- omy of China, signiﬁcant state ownership of many ﬁrms and the extensive and varied connections between the government and large ﬁrms allow us to examine how the effect of government signaling varies depending on the degree of direct government control. Furthermore, the extensive data available on these publicly listed ﬁrms allow us to statistically control for other potential expla- nations such as variations across industries and pressures from international shareholders and consumers. Our paper makes a number of contributions to orga- nizational theory. First, we show how dependence and monitoring create variations in ﬁrms’ strategic adher- ence to government signals about legitimate activities; Figure 1 A General Model of Firm Response to Government Signals with Application to CSR Reporting in China • Government issues   statements about CSR and   CSR reporting• Firms issue or don’t issue   CSR reports•Firms’ CSR reporting is   more or less substantive•Bureaucratic   embeddedness•Regional government   institutional development• Political connection to   national congresses• Political legacy• Financial resourcesGovernment signalslegitimacy guidelinesOrganizational responsePolitical dependencePolitical monitoringDecouplingDownloaded from informs.org by [131.193.251.47] on 02 August 2017, at 16:17 .

Organization Science 25(1), pp. 127–148, © 2014 INFORMS 129 we thus integrate neoinstitutional insights on the norma- tive mechanisms of the state (e.g., Dobbin and Sutton 1998) with work on political strategy (Hillman et al. 2004). We discuss how this perspective is particularly relevant to emerging markets in which laws and reg- ulations are frequently weak and enforcement is lack- ing (La Porta et al. 1998, Peng and Heath 1996, Young et al. 2008). We argue further that these insights are essential to developing a theory of political strategy that encompasses the diversity of corporate political mecha- nisms around the globe. Second, we show that different types of corporate political network ties (that is, ties to national congresses versus ties to the operating bureau- cracy) affect ﬁrm behavior differently. Some political ties, such as executives serving on political councils, are more symbolic, resulting in correspondingly symbolic CSR action. Other ties, such as the extent of embed- dedness in government bureaucracy, are more ongoing and concern material resources (Fan et al. 2007) and are therefore associated with greater monitoring and result in more substantial CSR action. Thus, the use of polit- ical networks can be a double-edged sword; they can increase access to resources but at the cost of more gov- ernment monitoring. Finally, we contribute to institu- tional theory more speciﬁcally by introducing the idea that ﬁrms perceive a decoupling risk that leads to vari- ations in symbolic strategies (Tilcsik 2010, Westphal and Zajac 2001) depending on the extent of external monitoring. China’s Political Economy and CSR Reporting Since China introduced its open-door economic reform policy in 1978, the country has developed a unique hybrid market economy. Since the mid-1980s, many Chinese ﬁrms have been transformed from govern- ment entities to publicly traded state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The two Chinese stock exchanges, Shanghai and Shenzhen, were founded in the early 1990s, and by 2009, they had over 1,600 listed ﬁrms. Table 1 provides details on the recent growth of publicly listed ﬁrms in China from 1999 to 2008, particularly SOEs and pri- vately controlled ﬁrms. Although SOEs have sold shares to outside investors, the government still maintains considerable ownership and control of these ﬁrms (Guthrie 2009). It holds sig- niﬁcant sway over the economy and is a critical source of resources and legitimacy for ﬁrms (Naughton 2007). The central government and governments at other lev- els can still allocate such important business resources as licenses and permits, subsidies, and project approval (Li et al. 2008). However, a critical issue in such con- texts is that the lack of a rule of law and the lack of government transparency can obscure the government’s priorities and decision-making processes (He and Tian 2008, Young et al. 2008). Thus, as we argue below, ﬁrms face greater ambiguity in how to interact with the gov- ernment. Responding appropriately to government sig- nals becomes a critical way to build legitimacy with governmental actors (Marquis et al. 2011). Chinese government priorities have been articulated in ﬁve-year plans since the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). These plans provide a state- ment of national economic development goals and lay out objectives for the subsequent ﬁve years (Naughton 2007). Many observers perceived an important shift in China’s economic development in 2006, when the Hu Jintao administration announced the 11th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development, artic- ulating a national vision based on the principles of a harmonious society and scientiﬁc development. This was widely viewed as a signal that the government was shift- ing from a policy of economic growth at all costs to one of economic growth balanced with the need to tackle pressing social and environmental problems (See 2009). That same year, the Sixth Plenum of the 16th Commu- nist Party Committee (CPC) Central Committee stated that ﬁrms should “create a harmonious situation in which everyone promotes harmony, and focusing on enhancing a sense of social responsibility amongst citizens, enter- prises and all kinds of organizations” (Sino-Swedish CSR Cooperation 2009). In close succession, other governmental actors, includ- ing the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges and the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, issued guidelines and recommendations on reporting corporate social and environmental activities as best practices for ﬁrms under their control (Lin 2010). Recently published in-depth case studies document the critical effect these steps had on CSR reporting practices in China (Marquis et al. 2010, 2011). For example, the ﬁrst Chinese reference book providing practical guid- ance on preparing a CSR report was published in 2008 under the auspices of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce Table 1 Publicly Listed Firms in China by Type of Control, 1999–2008 Year Number of listed ﬁrms % privately control % state owned 1999 930 16(cid:48)88 83(cid:48)12 2000 1,088 18(cid:48)59 81(cid:48)41 2001 1,140 18(cid:48)42 81(cid:48)58 2002 1,204 22(cid:48)59 77(cid:48)41 2003 1,258 26(cid:48)55 73(cid:48)45 2004 1,355 30(cid:48)85 69(cid:48)15 2005 1,351 30(cid:48)79 69(cid:48)21 2006 1,434 35(cid:48)29 64(cid:48)71 2007 1,529 38(cid:48)78 61(cid:48)22 2008 1,592 39(cid:48)57 60(cid:48)43 Downloaded from informs.org by [131.193.251.47] on 02 August 2017, at 16:17 .

Organization Science 25(1), pp. 127–148, © 2014 INFORMS (Yin et al. 2008). In addition, the government devel- oped its own reporting standard for Chinese companies (see, for example, Zhong 2009 for Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) standards 1.0 and 2.0). The bottom line, as noted by practitioners, is that whereas a Western company might “focus on its customers and investors as its most vital constituencies, the government sits at the top of the CSR pyramid in China as the impor- tant stakeholder in a business” (ChinaCSR.com 2009). Table A.1 in the appendix provides details of some of the critical communications the government has issued related to CSR and CSR reporting.1 Many observers have therefore concluded that (a) the government is sending signals through many channels that CSR is an appropriate and desired activity (Marquis et al. 2011, See 2009), and (b) Chinese ﬁrms have there- fore stepped up the pace of their CSR activities, particu- larly reporting, since 2006 (China WTO Tribune 2009). Global ﬁrms have been introducing CSR reports since the 1990s, with over 80% of the largest ﬁrms worldwide issuing reports by 2005 (KPMG 2008), but large Chinese SOEs such as State Grid, the COSCO Group, China Mobile, and the Baosteel Group did not begin publish- ing annual sustainability or CSR reports until after these government signals began in 2006. In our database of approximately 1,600 Chinese publicly listed ﬁrms, 536 have issued at least one CSR report since then. Figure 2 shows the number of reports disclosed by Chinese pub- licly listed ﬁrms since 2006. However, the quality of these reports varies signiﬁ- cantly; in general, Chinese CSR reporting has been criti- cized for its low quality (China WTO Tribune 2009). For instance, half the reports released contained only limited information on speciﬁc CSR activities; only 7.8% of the reports referred to the Global Reporting Initiative’s G3 (GRI 3.0) guidelines, the main international standard; and only 6.1% of the ﬁrms solicited third-party opinions of their reports (China WTO Tribune 2009). Thus, although Chinese ﬁrms may appear to be following government Figure 2 Number of CSR Reports Issued by Chinese Publicly Listed Firms, 2006–2009 signals regarding CSR, it is clear that not all of them are doing so in a substantive way. CSR Reporting as a Political Strategy in China Governments control critical resources that shape ﬁrms’ competitive environments and positions. As noted, polit- ical strategy research has focused on governmental activ- ities such as regulation, subsidies, and taxation (Schuler and Rehbein 1997), showing that ﬁrms are strategic in managing their relationships with government entities so as to enhance their own positions (Hillman et al. 2004, Schuler et al. 2002). With political activities such as lob- bying, political donations, and testimony, ﬁrms seek to reduce uncertainty, decrease transaction costs, and cre- ate business opportunities (Bonardi et al. 2006, Hillman et al. 1999, Lord 2000). Research on corporate political activities in the West has generally supported the notion that the greater the role of the government in a ﬁrm’s immediate environment, the more likely the ﬁrm is to engage in political strategies (Baron 1995, Bonardi et al. 2005, Schuler and Rehbein 1997, Schuler et al. 2002). For example, in the United States, ﬁrms in industries rep- resented by a congressional caucus are more likely to use lobbying and PAC contributions (Schuler et al. 2002). Research has begun exploring how corporate politi- cal strategies may differ in emerging economies where there is typically a less developed legal and political infrastructure (e.g., Peng and Heath 1996). Thus far, this stream of research has mainly focused on the impor- tance of ﬁrm leaders’ personal network ties with the government (e.g., Li et al. 2006, Wang and Qian 2011). We expand the research to a broader context, observ- ing that, on the one hand, government bodies are very strong and control many economic opportunities, includ- ing “industry access control, new investment ratiﬁcation, value-added tax differentiation, control of pace and pat- tern of privatization or decentralization, and government involvement in business activities such as material sourc- ing, distribution, and marketing” (Luo 2003, p. 1319). On the other hand, because the rule of law is absent and there is, in general, an underdeveloped institutional infrastructure and weak enforcement of existing rules, it can be hard for ﬁrms to know how to interpret and respond to the government (He and Tian 2008, Marquis et al. 2011, Peng and Heath 1996). We argue that in such situations, responding to government signals and building legitimacy with governmental actors is critical. The generality of this mechanism of responding to signals is supported by a deep stream of research in sociology that has studied how government action in the United States is as powerful in signaling norms and stan- dards of legitimacy as it is in formally coercing compli- ance and has found that variations in how ﬁrms respond to the signals is driven by ﬁrm characteristics (Edelman and Suchman 1997).

Organization Science 25(1), pp. 127–148, © 2014 INFORMS 131 such responses, Oliver and Holzinger (2008) pointed out that ﬁrms can comply with public policies or govern- ment regulations to derive as much value as possible, including legitimacy. In our study, political legitimacy is considered a strategic differentiator that ﬁrms pur- sue through multiple channels, depending on their spe- ciﬁc situations. In China, state ownership of some ﬁrms allows us to more effectively distinguish the mechanisms of government control from the less direct inﬂuence of signaling legitimate action. Most researchers have focused on the cognitive and normative dimensions of legitimacy (Scott 2001), but the political bases of legit- imacy need to be taken into account if one views legit- imacy as a strategic corporate resource. Thus, although we focus on an important emerging economy research site to study this signaling mechanism, we also argue that this is a general political strategy that ﬁrms use worldwide, based on diverse research that has shown the importance of government signaling in developed economies as well. In our empirical context, we view the Chinese gov- ernment’s statements and guidelines on CSR and CSR reporting since 2006 as akin to what Deephouse and Suchman (2008) refer to as legitimacy guidelines— signals sent by powerful actors that deﬁne appropri- ate activities for ﬁrms. Legitimacy guidelines from the government, however, provide a puzzle with respect to which organizations may be most likely to comply. Are organizations with high legitimacy (e.g., as a result of government ownership) more susceptible to these legit- imacy guidelines, or does their status spare them from having to engage in further legitimacy building? Con- versely, are ﬁrms with lower legitimacy (and hence more dependent on signaling) more likely to engage in legiti- macy building in an effort to improve their positions? Furthermore, as noted previously, the extent to which corporate relationships with the government create variations in monitoring will inﬂuence the extent and substance of CSR communications. Given stakeholder pressure to issue CSR reports, does a ﬁrm comply only symbolically (issuing vague, uninformative reports), or does it provide substantive details? Developing the idea of decoupling risk, we contend that organizations that are closely monitored by external stakeholders are more likely to engage in more substantive CSR. Governmental Actors and Political Legitimacy Our theoretical focus is on how the government inﬂu- ences corporate action by signaling norms and standards of legitimacy (Dobbin and Sutton 1998; Dobbin et al. 1993; Edelman 1990, 1992). We argue that acting in accordance with the government’s communicated inter- ests will afford a ﬁrm greater political legitimacy, which, in turn, gives the ﬁrm a greater positional advantage and less need to conform to government signals than ﬁrms with less political legitimacy. In many economies, those both emerging and devel- oped, there is signiﬁcant government ownership, which is a key source of legitimacy and provides positional advantage (Faccio and Lang 2002, La Porta et al. 1999). This is the case in China, where the government not only is a key regulator and policymaker but also holds owner- ship stakes in many ﬁrms, both large and small. Some- times it owns property rights; other times its inﬂuence is less direct. As state-owned ventures have been argued to “have legitimacy and receive support or even protection from the government agencies that have founded them” (Li and Zhang 2007, p. 794), we argue that SOEs have the most political legitimacy and therefore the least need to use activities such as CSR reporting to seek preferred status and associated resources from the government (Li and Zhang 2007, Ma and Parish 2006). As Brown (1998, p. 35, italics in original) noted, “Legitimate status is a sine qua non for easy access to resources, unre- stricted access to markets, and long term survival.” Firms lacking such positional advantage, such as privately con- trolled ﬁrms, may be more likely to view political legit- imacy as a strategic need (Oliver and Holzinger 2008). Historically, because private owners and entrepreneurs in China had low social status and were even considered “enemies” of the people, they experienced discrimina- tion that SOEs did not (Hong 2004, Huang 2008). Pri- vately controlled ﬁrms, a relatively new organizational form in China, lack legitimacy in the economy and the society and therefore have stronger incentives to com- pensate by cultivating their relationships with the gov- ernment (Li and Zhang 2007, Peng and Luo 2000). Thus, although a simple control-oriented perspective would suggest that SOEs are the ﬁrms most likely to issue CSR reports as a result of coercive pressure from their government owners, such ﬁrms’ inherent political legitimacy may instead buffer them from the need to communicate with government stakeholders. Our argu- ment uncovers an irony in how different types of ﬁrms in China respond to government signals: the govern- ment articulates CSR reporting guidelines for all compa- nies, yet our concept of political legitimacy suggests that such policies will mainly affect those that most need to enhance their legitimacy, the privately controlled ﬁrms. Indeed, previous research on Chinese ﬁrms has found that privately controlled ﬁrms exchange corporate dona- tions for legitimacy and political access (Hong 2004, Ma and Parish 2006) and that they beneﬁt more from their donations in terms of ﬁnancial performance than do SOEs (Wang and Qian 2011). Similarly, by issuing CSR reports, privately controlled ﬁrms can create good- will with government agencies and regulators and thus gain access to resources that are already easier for SOEs to obtain. We therefore hypothesize the following. Hypothesis 1 (H1). Privately controlled ﬁrms are more likely than other types of ﬁrms to issue CSR reports.

Organization Science 25(1), pp. 127–148, © 2014 INFORMS is important Political Dependence and CSR Reports Although it to identify the relationship between government ownership and ﬁrm legitimacy, there are also less direct but no less important mecha- nisms of inﬂuence. We focus on three key factors that we believe either enhance or reduce a ﬁrm’s political depen- dence and thus its need for political legitimacy; these are a ﬁrm’s (1) political connections to inﬂuential gov- ernment councils, (2) political legacy, and (3) ﬁnancial resources. Our hypotheses articulate that these factors not only are important main effects but also modify the effect of private ownership on CSR reporting. Connection to Political Councils. Government pol- icy and enforcement constitute a major external source of uncertainty for ﬁrms and have been shown to be a critical inﬂuence on operations (Hillman et al. 1999, Pfeffer and Salancik 1978). Firms cultivate political connections to manage the dependencies that constrain their actions, thus decreasing risk and uncertainty and increasing access, information, legitimacy, and resources (Hillman 2005). A ﬁrm’s political connections can be strategic assets (Hillman 2005, Siegel 2007), leading to preferential treatment by government-owned enter- prises (such as banks or raw material producers), lighter taxation, preferential treatment in competition for gov- ernment contracts, relaxed regulatory oversight of the company in question, or stiffer regulatory oversight of its rivals, and many other forms (Faccio 2006, p. 369). For instance, a study analyzing a sample of 450 polit- ically connected ﬁrms from 35 countries between 1997 and 2002 found that politically connected ﬁrms were signiﬁcantly more likely to be bailed out from economic distress than similar but poorly connected ﬁrms (Faccio et al. 2006). In China, is quite common for a ﬁrm’s leader- ship to have political connections. The ﬁrm’s executives may not only be members of the Chinese Communist Party but also hold top positions in the political system (Ma and Parish 2006). There are generally two types of political connections. First, corporate executives may be members of political councils such as the National People’s Congress (NPC), the only legislative body in China, or the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an advisory board for the Chinese government. Second, corporate executives may them- selves be government ofﬁcials, for example, bureaucrats in government agencies. Research has suggested that the former may have greater symbolic beneﬁt (O’Brien 1990) and the latter greater material beneﬁt (Li and Zhang 2007, Peng and Luo 2000). The distinct functions of these two types of political connections have signif- icant implications for a ﬁrm’s political dependence and its risk of monitoring by the government. In this section, we consider the symbolic beneﬁt of a ﬁrm’s executives serving on national political councils and how this would it affect CSR reporting. In a subsequent section, we focus on how a ﬁrm’s bureaucratic embeddedness affects the substantiveness of its CSR reporting. The NPC and CPPCC are often collectively referred as the “Two Meetings,” signifying their status as the two most important political councils in China and the key means for business leaders to participate in the govern- ment. Each council meets once a year and serves as a forum for mediating policy differences between the Chinese Communist Party and various parts of Chinese society. Research has suggested that a three- to ﬁve-year membership in either of the councils does more to signal social prestige than to deliver any immediate business beneﬁt (O’Brien 1990). The inﬂuence of these bodies on the operating government is quite low, as the Commu- nist Party and the government still maintain very strong inﬂuence and power over the legislature (Li et al. 2006). For instance, NPC representatives are welcome to make suggestions to the government but are forbidden to inter- vene in legislative and judicial activities (O’Brien 1990). The CPPCC is even more symbolic as its only func- tion is advisory; it has no right to participate in the cre- ation of policies and regulations (Ma and Parish 2006, Saich 2001). In the context of CSR reporting, we contend that polit- ical network connections created by corporate executives serving on these councils are more likely to lead to ﬁrms responding to government pressure for CSR reporting to sustain their reputations. By taking action in accordance with government policies, positions, and regulations— for example, by issuing CSR reports—ﬁrms and their executives maintain their legitimacy in the eyes of the government. Moreover, it can be harder for executives in privately controlled ﬁrms to become members of these political councils than it is for executives in SOEs, so the value of that membership is higher for them. Thus the impact of these connections on issuing CSR reports may be particularly important for privately controlled ﬁrms, as responding to policy signals may be one of the few ways they can show their commitment to government initiatives. We therefore hypothesize that these connec- tions also reinforce the previously hypothesized effect of private control. Hypothesis 2A (H2A). Firms whose chief executive ofﬁcers (CEOs) are members of national political coun- cils are more likely to issue CSR reports. Hypothesis 2B (H2B). The effect of private control on a ﬁrm’s CSR reporting will be stronger for ﬁrms whose CEOs are members of national political councils. Political Legacy. Another key organizational charac- teristic is how a ﬁrm’s founding era creates internal in persistent institutions and connections that result commitment that era.

Organization Science 25(1), pp. 127–148, © 2014 INFORMS 133 path-dependent (Barnett 2007) and has shown that gov- ernment inﬂuence at a ﬁrm’s founding imprints the ﬁrm in such a way that its subsequent actions reﬂect the ini- tial state policy (Marquis and Tilcsik 2013, Stinchcombe 1965). A growing stream of research on how being founded in a socialist political environment affects a ﬁrm’s subsequent strategies (Kogut and Zander 2000, Kriauciunas and Kale 2006) describes such “socialist imprinting” as a process whereby ﬁrm-speciﬁc capabili- ties and knowledge resources are also era-speciﬁc. After market transitions, such capabilities prove to be ill-suited to the new environment. Chinese reform has tended toward gradual market liberalization over the past 30 years, but the change has accelerated recently. For instance, direct govern- ment intervention in business has been reduced since the implementation of the 2004 PRC Administrative Approval Law, which provides guidelines for govern- ment activities and protects the interests of Chinese citi- zens, legal persons, and other interest groups. Thus, it is likely that older ﬁrms have a greater “socialist imprint” than younger ﬁrms and are less likely to pursue recent trends and management ideas that are inconsistent with their operating ideologies. Indeed, studies have found that older Chinese ﬁrms have well established structures and vested interests and are less likely to respond to new governance practices such as the appointment of out- side directors; younger ﬁrms, by contrast, have stronger incentives to establish their legitimacy and thus to intro- duce new governance practices (Peng 2004). Firms founded when state control of the economy was more extensive are probably not as attuned to new globally diffused practices such as CSR reporting and do not feel as much legitimacy pressure to adopt them. It would also follow that the effect of private control on the pursuit of political legitimacy by issuing CSR reports would be weaker for older privately controlled ﬁrms than for younger ﬁrms. These older ﬁrms, being imprinted with legitimacy-seeking strategies prevalent in the socialist era, would have more difﬁculty adopting the newer practices. These arguments lead us to offer the following hypotheses. Hypothesis 3A (H3A). Older ﬁrms are less likely to issue CSR reports. Hypothesis 3B (H3B). The effect of private control on CSR reporting will be weaker for older ﬁrms. Financial Resources. Research has shown that ﬁrms with greater ﬁnancial resources are more able to engage in political activities (Schuler and Rehbein 1997) and capture a larger portion of the associated ben- eﬁts (Hillman et al. 2004) and that slack resources signiﬁcantly affect corporate social activities such as philanthropy (Seifert et al. 2004, Waddock and Graves 1997, Wang et al. 2008). Research has also found that organizations are more likely to follow legitimated prac- tices to a greater extent if they have greater ﬁnancial resources (Park et al. 2011). If the purpose of CSR and CSR reporting is to gain legitimacy from the govern- ment, then both higher-performing ﬁrms and those with more slack resources would be more likely to mobilize those resources to issue CSR reports. Compared with SOEs, which typically beneﬁt from government backing and resources, privately controlled ﬁrms’ actions are in general more responsive to changes in their ﬁnancial positions. Therefore, we expect a pri- vately controlled ﬁrm’s CSR reporting to be particularly responsive to its ﬁnancial resources and, in particular, expect that greater ﬁnancial resources would increase the likelihood of CSR reporting. Moreover, greater ﬁnancial resources may create higher external pressure for these ﬁrms to be more transparent and engage in more CSR- related activities. Hypothesis 4A (H4A). Firms with greater ﬁnancial resources (higher performance and more slack) are more likely to issue CSR reports. Hypothesis 4B (H4B). The effect of private control on CSR reporting will be enhanced for ﬁrms with greater ﬁnancial resources (higher performance and more slack). Government Monitoring and Substantive CSR Reporting A ﬁrm’s response to its dependence on the gov- ernment may vary with the likelihood or extent of government monitoring. One common response is decoupling (Meyer and Rowan 1977)—the symbolic compliance with a stakeholder demand without making substantive changes. For example, a series of studies by Westphal and Zajac (1994, 1995, 2001) have shown that ﬁrms often respond to stakeholder demands, such as to issue stock buybacks and create executive incentive pro- grams, by publicizing actions that they have not actually taken. In another domain, governments may put pres- sure on schools to adopt certain standards or curricula, with little effect on actual teaching processes (Meyer and Rowan 1978). Decoupling is a useful strategy for ﬁrms because it “enables organizations to maintain standard- ized, legitimating, formal structures, while their activi- ties vary in response to practical considerations” (Meyer and Rowan 1977, p. 357). Most research on decoupling suggests that because stakeholders typically do not scrutinize implementation (Zajac and Westphal 2004), there has been little con- sideration of what would happen if decoupling were exposed. However, research on greenwashing, a strategy similar to decoupling whereby ﬁrms overemphasize pos- itive aspects of their environmental records to mask their actual performance, suggests that there are signiﬁcant risks to this strategy in that stakeholders punish ﬁrms Downloaded from informs.org by [131.193.251.47] on 02 August 2017, at 16:17 .

Organization Science 25(1), pp. 127–148, © 2014 INFORMS exposed as greenwashers, even if their environmental performance is better than organizations that do not greenwash. In one notable case, British Petroleum, hav- ing touted itself as “Beyond Petroleum,” received more criticism for its environmental record than did Exxon, a ﬁrm generally considered to have a worse environmen- tal impact (Lyon and Maxwell 2011). This suggests that a ﬁrm’s information disclosure is sometimes monitored and that there is a risk of censure if that ﬁrm is found to have engaged in obfuscation or symbolic compliance rather than having done what it claimed. This perspective is also consistent with Campbell’s (2007) proposition that ﬁrms are more likely to act in socially responsible ways when actors such as non-governmental organiza- tions, social movements, and media monitor their behav- ior. For example, studies have shown that government oversight or monitoring leads to higher rates of imple- mentation of labor provisions (Dobbin et al. 2009), envi- ronmental self-regulation (Short and Toffel 2010), and corporate governance codes that are easier to monitor (Okhmatovskiy and David 2012). We depart from the traditional decoupling perspective that suggests implementation is not scrutinized (Zajac and Westphal 2004), focusing instead on what we term decoupling risk: how the risk that a ﬁrm’s decoupling will be exposed varies across ﬁrms. We expect ﬁrms with higher decoupling risk (i.e., those whose activities are more likely to be monitored) to be more likely to engage in substantive CSR reporting. (As mentioned ear- lier, the high variation in the details of CSR reports allows us to determine the extent to which those reports indicate actual CSR activities.2) We hypothesize how increased monitoring—and therefore increased likeli- hood of substantial CSR activity—can emerge from two types of government relation: bureaucratic embedded- ness and regional government institutional development. Bureaucratic Embeddedness. As discussed above, government connections are an important strategy by which Chinese ﬁrms gain access to resources. A ﬁrm can gain great symbolic beneﬁt if its executives attend the annual meetings of large national congresses such as the NPC and CPPCC. However, there are other types of government connections that are more ongoing and that may expose the ﬁrm to more stringent monitor- ing. In China, executives can hold government positions; for example, they can be heads of governmental depart- ments and bureaus (Fan et al. 2007). Such bureaucratic connections have been shown to confer greater access to resources or material beneﬁt than do the more sym- bolic connections to national congresses. For instance, Peng and Luo (2000) found that managers’ interper- sonal ties with government ofﬁcials helped improve their ﬁrms’ performance. Li and Zhang (2007) also found that new ventures in China rely on government ofﬁ- cials to obtain information and funding that contribute to performance. Furthermore, ﬁrms with such political connections often have better access to resources critical for growth (Nee 1992). Yet, for a number of reasons, such bureaucratic embed- dedness is also likely to expose a ﬁrm to greater gov- ernment monitoring. First, research has shown that government agencies and bureaucracies are the key gov- ernment areas responsible for policy implementation. This leads to greater organizational oversight (Bonardi et al. 2006, Hiatt and Park 2013). Second, such con- nections are more ongoing and involve closer connec- tions with the government. For instance, Dickson (2003) argued that including top business leaders in the bureau- cracy is a means of co-opting them, giving the govern- ment another form of informal control over the economy. Existing CEOs can be recruited into the government. Furthermore, the Chinese government may appoint or encourage government ofﬁcials to become executives or directors of ﬁrms in order to gain more control over those ﬁrms (Fan et al. 2007). Whereas ﬁrms may cre- ate or maintain bureaucratic ties for increased access to resources, these ties are also likely to subject the ﬁrm to greater scrutiny, in turn making the ﬁrm more likely to engage in substantial CSR practices (Dickson 2003). We therefore hypothesize the following. Hypothesis 5. Firms whose leaders hold positions as government ofﬁcials will be more likely to engage in more substantive CSR reporting. Regional Government Institutional Development. Prior research on the relationship between a ﬁrm’s insti- tutional environment and the political strategies it adopts in response has typically emphasized the importance of institutional differences at the federal or central levels (Hillman et al. 2004), with limited attention to how vari- ations within a country affects ﬁrms’ political strategies. Yet the latter perspective is particularly important in emerging economies such as China, where the unde- veloped institutional infrastructure creates challenges for ﬁrms (Young et al. 2008). During the reform period, there have been signiﬁcant variations across China in the extent to which regional governments have seized the opportunity to use market mechanisms to develop the local economy, enhance ﬁscal health, and, correspond- ingly, enhance development of regional government institutions. The ﬁscal reforms of the 1980s gave certain economic rights and responsibilities to each government jurisdiction above the village level, thus increasing local and provincial government revenues (Walder 1995).3 As a result, governments in developed regions have accu- mulated signiﬁcant ﬁnancial resources and have intro- duced more advanced management techniques, making them more likely to have not only the resources but also the expertise to monitor corporate activities (Brandt and Li 2003, Goldstein 1995). We therefore hypothesize the following. Downloaded from informs.org by [131.193.251.47] on 02 August 2017, at 16:17 .

Organization Science 25(1), pp. 127–148, © 2014 INFORMS 135 Hypothesis 6. Firms headquartered in more institu- tionally developed regions will be more likely to engage in more substantive CSR reporting. Methods and Analyses Data and Sample This study covers all Chinese ﬁrms that were listed on the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2006 to 2009. Data sources include archival data from the China Stock Market and Accounting Research (CSMAR) database, ﬁrms’ annual reports and CSR reports, the National Bureau of Statistics of China, and CSR report ratings from the CSR rating agency Runling (also known by its English acronym, RKS; http://www.rksratings.com). CSMAR is the primary source for information on Chinese stock markets and the ﬁnancial statements of Chinese listed ﬁrms. Corpo- rate annual reports provide a biographical sketch of the CEO, including his or her previous experience in indus- try and government (Fan et al. 2007). CSR reports were also downloaded from ﬁrm and stock exchange websites. Our ratings of the substance of a ﬁrm’s CSR report are from RKS and cover 2008 and 2009. We complement that information with provincial-level development data from the Chinese Statistics Bureau. After merging these databases and removing observations that were missing key explanatory variables (about 6%), we have a sample of 5,660 ﬁrm-year observations. There is a one-year lag between all independent and dependent variables. Measures Dependent Variables. Our main foci in this study are the factors that would affect (a) whether a ﬁrm issues a CSR report and (b) the substance of CSR activities depicted in the report. Thus, we have two dependent variables. CSR report is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the focal ﬁrm has issued a CSR report in a given year, and it is 0 otherwise. In our sample, the number of CSR reports issued by Chinese public ﬁrms increased year after year (see Figure 2). CSR reporting substantiveness is an overall rating of CSR activities as portrayed in the report. We obtained these ratings from the RKS, whose organization and China-speciﬁc products are modeled after the U.S. social investment rating agency Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini & Co., Inc. (KLD). Like KLD, RKS is entirely independent of the companies it rates. Because what it rates is ﬁrms’ activities as presented in their CSR reports, the data it gathers are from those reports as well as other ﬁrm communications such as websites and press releases. Firms’ CSR activities are rated along three dimensions: (1) overall evaluation includes a ﬁrm’s CSR strategy, the extent of stakeholder participation in CSR activities, the comparability of report information over time, the inno- vativeness of the ﬁrm’s CSR activities, and the extent of external auditing; (2) content evaluation focuses on the extent of leadership and organizational systems in place for implementing CSR and on speciﬁc metrics for eco- nomic, environmental, and social responsibilities; and (3) technical evaluation focuses on items such as the transparency, regularity, and availability of CSR infor- mation. These three dimensions together include over 70 subdimensions (the list is available from the authors). The rating ranges from 0 to 100. This evaluation sys- tem is based on the GRI 3.0 guidelines, which RKS adapted for use in China by adding China-speciﬁc CSR elements. For example, Chinese ﬁrms frequently publi- cize the amount of taxes they pay to the government as a form of social responsibility, which RKS captures. Each CSR report is evaluated by at least three RKS experts, each with at least three years of CSR experience and no conﬂicts of interests involving the focal ﬁrm. Given our interest in assessing the extent to which CSR reporting reﬂects a greater degree of substantive CSR activity, an alternative to the RKS composite measure (all three dimensions) would be to take into account only the overall evaluation and content evalu- ation dimensions. We conducted supplementary analy- ses with this alternative dependent variable as well as a number of other robustness checks4 and always achieved the same results (results available from the authors on request). Independent Variables. Two sets of independent vari- ables were used to test the hypotheses predicting the two dependent variables. For the analysis of the CSR report, we used the following independent variables: pri- vate control is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the ﬁrm was owned by dispersed private shareholders and 0 if the ultimate owner was the Chinese government and its agencies (Wang et al. 2008).5 CEO NPC/CPPCC mem- bership is a dummy variable equal to 1 if the CEO was a member of the CPCC, and 0 otherwise.6 Firm age is the number of years since the ﬁrm was established. Financial resources were captured by two variables: ﬁrm ROA is the return on assets calculated as net income over total assets, a common accounting- based measure of ﬁnancial performance. ROA is seen as the best performance measure to use in China (Peng and Luo 2000). Seifert et al. (2004) argued that cash ﬂow better captures the notion of available resources for discretionary purposes. Thus, we calculated slack resources as the sum of cash ﬂow from a ﬁrm’s oper- ating, ﬁnancing, and investing activities. To control for ﬁrm size, we scaled slack resources by total assets (Carow et al. 2004). For the analysis of CSR reporting substantiveness, we used the following independent variables: CEO as gov- ernment ofﬁcial is a dummy variable used to measure bureaucratic embeddedness. It equals 1 when the CEO is or has been an ofﬁcer of the central or regional gov- ernments, and it is 0 otherwise (Bai et al. 2006, Li et al. 2006). As noted, we expect that ﬁrms in regions of Downloaded from informs.org by [131.193.251.47] on 02 August 2017, at 16:17 .

Organization Science 25(1), pp. 127–148, © 2014 INFORMS China with more developed governments will issue more substantive CSR reports. We measure regional institu- tional development as a province’s gross domestic prod- uct (GDP) per capita (i.e., the province’s GDP divided by its population), which we obtained from the Chinese Statistics Bureau. This is consistent with prior research showing that economic development is highly related to government development in China (Walder 1995). Control Variables. We controlled for additional vari- ables that may affect either a ﬁrm’s decision to issue a CSR report or the report’s substantiveness. Because larger ﬁrms may have more staff and infras- tructure with which to issue CSR reports or to provide greater substance, we include ﬁrm size, the natural log of a ﬁrm’s total assets. in May 2008, Stock market regulations require some ﬁrms to pro- duce CSR reports. For instance, the Shanghai Stock Exchange issued a policy requiring ﬁrms in the corporate governance group,7 ﬁrms listed on for- eign stock exchanges such as New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKSE), and ﬁrms in ﬁnancial industries to issue CSR reports. In the Shenzhen Stock Exchange, ﬁrms belonging to the SZSE 100 Index are required to issue CSR reports. We there- fore include required discloser, a dummy variable equal to 1 if a ﬁrm’s characteristics suggest it would be required to issue a CSR report in a given year and 0 otherwise.8 We expect that highly visible ﬁrms will be more likely to disclose CSR reports and that their reports will be more substantive. We chose ﬁve newspapers— the International Finance News, People’s Daily, the Market News, the Jinghua News, and the Jiangnan News—for their prevalence in and relevance to ﬁrm economic activities. We used a website search engine (http://www.search.people.com.cn) to assign a value to media exposure, the number of news articles about a focal ﬁrm in a given year. Because ﬁrms with experience issuing CSR reports may be more likely to do so in a given year and to do so more substantively, we also controlled for reporting experience, which is equal to 1 if the focal ﬁrm has issued a CSR report before and 0 otherwise.9 To the extent that Chinese ﬁrms are becoming global, they may be exposed to additional pressures regarding reporting and transparency (KPMG 2008). We there- fore controlled for foreign sales and international expo- sure as measures of the pressure a ﬁrm faces from the international market. Foreign sales is the ﬁrm’s foreign sales as a percentage of total sales (Hitt et al. 1997). International stockholders is a dummy variable equal to 1 if a ﬁrm is cross-listed in international stock mar- ket exchanges such as HKSE and NYSE or has issued B-shares to foreign investors. These two variables are important to control for the extent to which international pressure drives a ﬁrm’s CSR reporting. Because there could be a difference between ﬁrms listed in the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges, we included a dummy variable, stock market exchange, which is equal to 1 if the ﬁrm is listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange and 0 if it is listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. There is a signiﬁcant variation in the extent of CSR reporting across the years of our study (2006–2009). To control for a potential time effect, we included year dummy variables in the analysis. Furthermore, to con- trol for possible differences in CSR reporting across industries, which may be under pressure from different sources, we included 12 industry dummies represent- ing the 13 industry categories10 identiﬁed by the China Securities Regulatory Commission.11 Predictors of CSR Reporting Substantiveness. To con- trol for the fact that stakeholder monitoring might affect the probability of issuing a CSR report, we also included the key predictors of CSR reporting substantiveness, CEO as government ofﬁcial and regional institutional development, as control variables when predicting the probability of a CSR report. Estimation Method We used a different method to test each of our two predictions.12 The ﬁrst analysis involved estimating the probability of a ﬁrm issuing a CSR report by applying a logit model to the entire sample of 5,660 ﬁrm-year observations. We then used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to examine the relationship between moni- toring and substantive CSR reporting. The sample was limited to ﬁrms whose CSR reports had been rated by RKS, which resulted in 791 observations.13 To con- trol for multiple observations per ﬁrm and for any potential heteroskedasticity, we report cluster-adjusted and heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors in both our analyses. We conducted our statistical analysis using Stata 11.1. Results Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics and correlations for each of our variables. Panel A includes the variables used in the logit model to predict the probability of a ﬁrm issuing a CSR report; panel B includes the variables used in the OLS regression to predict the substantive- ness of CSR reporting. Because in this analysis there are signiﬁcant intercorrelations among some variables, we computed variance inﬂation factors (VIFs) to investigate whether there was a potential multicollinearity problem. The maximum VIF obtained in any of the models was 2.4 (ﬁrm size); the mean VIF was 1.3, below the rule- of-thumb cutoff of 10 (Ryan 1997). Therefore, we do not believe that multicollinearity signiﬁcantly affects our results. Downloaded from informs.org by [131.193.251.47] on 02 August 2017, at 16:17 .

Table 3 presents the logistic regression estimates of the probability of a ﬁrm issuing a CSR report. Model 1 included all the organizational and environmental con- trol variables. Firm size, required discloser, reporting experience, media exposure, and stock market exchange all had signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the probability of issuing a CSR report. Models 2–7 tested the hypotheses. In Model 2, the coefﬁcient of private control was positive as predicted but below marginal signiﬁcance. Hypothesis 1 was there- fore not supported. Hypotheses 2A and 2B stated that ﬁrms whose CEOs are members of national political councils would be more likely to issue CSR reports and that this would strengthen the effect of private control on CSR reporting. In Model 3, the main effect of CEOs as political council members was positive and signiﬁcant, supporting Hypothesis 2A. When holding other variables at their mean, the probability of issuing a CSR report is 3.49% higher for ﬁrms with CEOs who are members of the NPC or CPPCC than the probability for ﬁrms with- out such connections. However, in Model 4, the interac- tion term between CEO NPC/CPPCC membership and Downloaded from informs.org by [131.193.251.47] on 02 August 2017, at 16:17 .

Organization Science 25(1), pp. 127–148, © 2014 INFORMS 139 Figure 3 Interaction Effect Between Private Control and Firm Age on CSR Reporting CSR reporting. In Model 2, the effect of having a CEO who is or has been a government ofﬁcial was marginally signiﬁcant (p < 0(cid:48)10), partially supporting Hypothesis 5. Hypothesis 6 predicted that the level of government insti- tutional development of the region in which the ﬁrm is headquartered would positively affect substantive CSR reporting. In Model 3, the effect of regional development was positively signiﬁcant (p < 0(cid:48)05), supporting Hypoth- esis 6. Everything else being equal, a one-unit increase in regional development will increase the substantiveness of CSR reports by 13%. The results were the same in Model 4, which included both independent variables. It is worth noting that the control variables return results that are highly consistent with our theory. In the analyses examining CSR reporting probability, neither Figure 4 Interaction Effect Between Private Control and Firm Slack Resources on CSR Reporting private control was not signiﬁcant; Hypothesis 2B there- fore was not supported. Hypotheses 3A and 3B predicted that older ﬁrms are less likely to issue CSR reports and that the positive impact of private control will be weakened for older ﬁrms. In Model 3, ﬁrm age was negatively related to the probability of CSR reporting (p < 0(cid:48)01), support- ing Hypothesis 3A. A one-standard-deviation increase in ﬁrm age decreases the probability of issuing a CSR report by 8.1%. In Model 5, ﬁrm age negatively inter- acted with private control (p < 0(cid:48)05), lending support to Hypothesis 3B. Hypotheses 4A and 4B predicted that a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial resources, measured as ﬁrm ROA and slack resources, would positively affect the probability of CSR reporting and would also moderate the impact of private control on the probability of CSR reporting. In Model 3, both ﬁrm ROA and slack resources positively affected CSR report- ing (at p < 0(cid:48)001 and p < 0(cid:48)05, respectively), provid- ing support for Hypothesis 4A. A one-standard-deviation increase in ﬁrm ROA increases the probability of issuing a CSR report by 8.41% (from 6.18% to 14.59%); the same increase in slack resources increases the probabil- ity by 6.30%. In Model 6, the interaction term between private control and ﬁrm ROA was not statistically sig- niﬁcant, but the interaction term between private control and slack resources was positive and signiﬁcant (p < 0(cid:48)05). This provided partial support for Hypothesis 4B: privately controlled companies with high discretionary cash ﬂow are more likely to issue CSR reports than are SOEs with similar resources. Model 7 included all the main effects and the interactions; the results were largely consistent with those of the reduced models. Because we are testing interaction effects in a logit model, it is important to acknowledge the controversy regarding the validity of computing and interpreting sta- tistically signiﬁcant interactions in these models (Hoetker 2007, Norton et al. 2004). In presenting our results, we follow Greene’s (2010) suggestion that researchers should conduct hypothesis testing on their model and not on predicted values. We thus present our interpreta- tions based on our model and provide visualizations for interpretation, using the standard Aiken and West (1991) approach to plot the signiﬁcant interactions. Furthermore, we have conducted robustness checks using the Stata int- eff procedure (Norton et al. 2004) to verify that our infer- ences based on the interaction coefﬁcients are valid.14 The interaction effects between private control and ﬁrm age and between private control and slack resources are shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively; the patterns are consistent with our predictions. Table 4 presents the OLS regression model of CSR reporting substantiveness. Model 1 included all the orga- nizational and environmental controls. Models 2–4 tested the predictions of Hypotheses 5 and 6.

These results reinforce the idea that these ﬁrms are aware that they may be under additional scrutiny and therefore issue reports only when they can engage in substantive CSR practices. Alternatively, factors that signiﬁcantly affected the likelihood of CSR reporting probability, such as ﬁrm ROA, slack resources, and CEO NPC/CPPCC member- ship, had no effect on the substantiveness of report- ing. Also consistent with this pattern, required discloser and media exposure had positive impacts on issuing reports but had no effect on the reports’ substantiveness. It may be that these factors exert pressure on a ﬁrm in such a way that they are more likely to engage in symbolic reporting. Comparing these results across mod- els gives us conﬁdence that ﬁrms engage in both sym- bolic and substantive reporting and that our theoretical model helps unpack the processes that lead to one or the other. It is important to note as well that we controlled for other potential economic or market pressures not only to ensure that our theorized effects are net of alter- native explanations but also to strengthen our claim that the government processes we established are the key relationships in this context. Neither the industry dummy variables we included (results available from the authors on request) nor the two measures of international pressure, foreign sales and international stockholders, were signiﬁcant. Regarding this last set of controls, as noted, a plausible alternative set of pressures is the extent to which globalizing Chinese ﬁrms are exposed to international standards of CSR reporting and trans- parency (KPMG 2008). However, in accordance with our original hypotheses, our results show that it is not these factors that drive CSR decisions but factors related to ﬁrms’ exposure to the domestic government. Discussion and Conclusions This study focused on how and why ﬁrms strategically respond to government signals on CSR.

Organization Science 25(1), pp. 127–148, © 2014 INFORMS 141 to a complex process, with several factors inﬂuencing political dependency, which in turn affects the likeli- hood that a ﬁrm will comply with government signals by issuing CSR reports. Our emerging market context, i.e., a country whose government is a substantial owner of many ﬁrms, allowed us to differentiate between govern- ment relations focused on control versus those focused on a ﬁrm’s quest for greater legitimacy. We found that a number of variables that proxy ﬁrm dependence on the government—including CEO membership in polit- ical councils (the NPC or CPPCC), political legacy, and ﬁnancial resources—all affect its legitimacy posi- tion and, correspondingly, the likelihood of issuing a CSR report. Although our ﬁndings on the main effect of private control were not statistically signiﬁcant, a num- ber of the other political factors tested did moderate the effect of private control on reporting, suggesting that a ﬁrm’s response to government signals is not a simple process. Firms face many different pressures depending on their characteristics. One unique feature of China is that there are also strong pressures from the government on some SOEs to be global exemplars (Marquis et al. 2011). Thus, a key conclusion of our research is that the effects of government legitimacy pressures cannot be accurately identiﬁed without fully understanding how a ﬁrm’s background, situation, and position affect its polit- ical dependence. We encourage future research to better understand the contingencies that affect ﬁrms’ political dependence and associated pressures. In addition to examining the issuance of a CSR report, which can be seen as primarily a symbolic act, we also examined the extent to which the likelihood of gov- ernment monitoring leads ﬁrms to produce reports with greater substantive content. Here, we found that another type of government pressure, i.e., bureaucratic embed- dedness (whether the CEO has experience as a govern- ment ofﬁcial), was a signiﬁcant predictor of substantive CSR reporting. We believe this is because such ties, being much tighter than the more symbolic memberships in political councils, expose the ﬁrm to greater monitor- ing. A ﬁrm’s location in an area with greater government institutional development also predicts more substantive CSR reporting. It is important to note that the factors that lead a ﬁrm to be more substantive in its reporting did not signiﬁcantly affect the ﬁrm’s likelihood of issu- ing a report. This suggests that such ﬁrms are aware that their political position brings them additional scrutiny and therefore only issue a report when they can issue a substantive one. As we detail below, we believe these ﬁndings offer broader contributions to research on both corporate polit- ical strategy and institutional theory. Contributions to Research on Corporate Political Strategy Whereas much prior research has focused on the important mechanisms of corporate political strategy in Western contexts (e.g., Hillman 2003), researchers are now focusing more on comparing and contrasting that corporate political strategy with those in emerging mar- kets such as China (He and Tian 2008, Tian et al. 2009). Corporate political strategy is “not only important to bet- ter understanding ﬁrms’ competitive strategies in more transparent developed nations but is particularly impor- tant to understanding the relationship-based strategies needed in developing countries” (Pearce et al. 2008, p. 494). Our setting provides a novel context in which to uncover these political processes and to illustrate an intriguing paradox in the Chinese government’s control of ﬁrms. As a substantial owner of SOEs, the govern- ment issues guidelines for such enterprises, so one might expect SOEs to be on the vanguard of implementing new policies. But, in fact, our study of legitimacy and depen- dence argues that such signals are more likely to be followed by privately controlled ﬁrms, which our inter- action effect results support. We have taken advantage of China’s unique characteristics to better understand government signaling and how a ﬁrm’s characteristics inﬂuence its response to signaling. We concur with Tsui (2007) that such research is crucial to developing more general, nuanced management theory that is capa- ble of understanding organizational behavior across the globe. Correspondingly, the focus on strategic response to government signals resonates clearly with more general institutional research showing that a key form of gov- ernment inﬂuence on corporate action is the creation of legitimacy norms that signal government goals and interests (Dobbin and Sutton 1998; Dobbin et al. 1993; Edelman 1990, 1992). At a general level, one contribu- tion of our paper is joining research on corporate politi- cal strategy (e.g., Hillman 2003, Hillman et al. 2004) and institutional research, thus identifying an important and insufﬁciently studied mechanism of corporate political strategy, i.e., adherence to government signals on politi- cally legitimate behavior. We encourage future research on this topic to better understand the variety of politi- cal signals and corporate responses across the globe and how these interacting mechanisms have changed over time. A second contribution of our paper is to unpack the implications of different types of political relationships (Hillman 2005, Siegel 2007) for ﬁrms’ responses to gov- ernment pressure. The main point of prior research is that ﬁrms acquire a variety of beneﬁts (i.e., information, access, inﬂuence, and reduced uncertainty and transac- tion costs; see Faccio 2006, Hillman 2005) through their connections with the government. In our study, some types of connections, such as membership in the NPC or CPPCC, are more symbolic than others, and we ﬁnd that they are more likely to result in correspondingly symbolic compliance. Bureaucratic embeddedness, how- ever, may result in closer monitoring by the govern- ment, making ﬁrms more likely to engage in substantive Downloaded from informs.org by [131.193.251.47] on 02 August 2017, at 16:17 .

Organization Science 25(1), pp. 127–148, © 2014 INFORMS CSR activity. Bureaucratic connections may thus be a double-edged sword. Whereas research has shown them to be essential for access to resources in China (Fan et al. 2007), this may come at the expense of addi- tional government scrutiny. We also found evidence of a political imprinting process such that older ﬁrms, pre- sumably more inﬂuenced by the earlier socialist system, were less likely to pursue CSR reporting as a political strategy. Whereas these contributions highlight the beneﬁts of studying this context (Tsui 2007), we also acknowl- edge a number of idiosyncrasies of the Chinese polit- ical system that may limit the generalizability of our results. Government–ﬁrm relations may be more impor- tant in China than in other countries (Farashahi and Hafsi 2009, Guthrie 2009) and more likely to reﬂect decoupling (Marquis et al. 2011). Studies have doc- umented the importance of corporate political ties in other Asian countries (Siegel 2007) and in the United States (e.g., Hillman et al. 1999), but it would be worthwhile to examine whether our speciﬁc ﬁndings hold elsewhere. As companies globalize, understanding the variation in political mechanisms is an important research endeavor both for organizational theory and for managerial practice. Contributions to Institutional Theory Our research also makes important contributions to insti- tutional theory. First, as discussed above, government signals shape deﬁnitions of legitimacy, and speciﬁc ﬁrms’ responses to those signals are shaped by their dependence on the government and the likelihood of government monitoring. Regarding the latter, our identi- ﬁcation of decoupling risk is an important contribution to understanding how and when ﬁrms adopt a sym- bolic strategy in response to external demands. Research has identiﬁed a decoupling gap in a variety of settings, including school curricula (Meyer and Rowan 1978), social movement communications (Elsbach and Sutton 1992), and corporate strategies (Westphal and Zajac 1994, 2001), but it has given much less consideration to the causes of organization-level variation in decou- pling (Scott 2008). Contrary to research suggesting that ﬁrms’ symbolic strategies are not monitored (Zajac and Westphal 2004), our results suggest that ﬁrms know they face a risk in decoupling and are less likely to do so the more likely they are to be monitored. Whereas ear- lier work suggested variation in decoupling based on internal ﬁrm characteristics such as CEO power and board composition (Westphal and Zajac 2001), our ﬁnd- ings suggest variations based on the closeness of the ﬁrm’s relationship with the government and on the level of government monitoring associated with that relation- ship. We believe it is consequential that a number of ﬁrm characteristics, including our hypothesized effects of bureaucratic embeddedness and regional government development, lead ﬁrms to be more substantive in their reporting while having no effect on the likelihood that they will issue a report in the ﬁrst place. It is likely that these ﬁrms perceive that, if they do issue a report, they will be exposed to greater monitoring, so the report had better be substantive. Our framing of this second stage of our analyses focused on the substantiveness of CSR reporting. We acknowledge that a more detailed test of the substantive- ness of CSR activities would be gained by examining the activities themselves. Yet, based on our supplementary analyses, discussions with consultants, and spot-checking of the highest- and lowest-rated CSR reports, there are strong indications of a high level of agreement between a ﬁrm issuing more substantive reports and actually enact- ing CSR practices. To prove this connection more con- cretely, future research may endeavor to collect data on CSR activities directly. Furthermore, we acknowledge that because of data constraints in our analysis of report- ing substantiveness, we could only examine two years of activity, which limited our statistical power. This may have resulted in weaker ﬁndings than if we had had more years of data, so we encourage future research on this topic in other settings free of this constraint. In conclusion, we believe that introducing our idea of decoupling risk (and associated monitoring processes) to the increasingly important area of CSR reporting may have the practical beneﬁt of highlighting an important pathway by which ﬁrms can be encouraged to act mean- ingfully in accordance with their purported corporate responsibility. Over the past 15 years, the number of global ﬁrms issuing CSR and sustainability reports has increased from virtually none to over 3,000 (Eccles and Krzus 2010). Yet such reporting has been criticized as a sophisticated version of greenwashing or “pinkwash- ing” (i.e., spreading a veneer of disclosure over a lack of actual CSR activity). CSR itself has been criticized as mostly “myth and ceremony” with little actual sub- stance (Lyon and Maxwell 2011). Although our results support the idea that some CSR activity may be sym- bolic, they also suggest that increased monitoring will lead ﬁrms to truly be more socially and environmentally responsible.

Guide on social responsibility for Chinese business enterprises and associations April 2008 All-China Federation of Industrial Economics The standard aims to build the capability for social responsibility of Chinese enterprises and provide the recommended standards and practices to Chinese enterprises for references. The standard and practices include normative suggestions (meaning that Chinese enterprises are strongly “encouraged” to obey them). It clearly encourages listed ﬁrms to issue social responsibility reports. The guide particularly encourages ﬁrms that may have safety accidents, such as ﬁrms in the biotech industry, high-pollution industries, mining, construction, etc., to issue CSR reports. It states that the most urgent task is to build CSR laws and regulations for ﬁrms to follow. As the third stock exchange in the world that issues a corporate social responsibility guide, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange encourages listed companies to follow the social responsibility systems outlined in the guide, and it also suggests that those companies issue corporate social responsibility reports along with their annual reports. The guide requires that CSR reports of listed companies include the following: implementation of social responsibility as it pertains to employee protection, environmental pollution, product quality, and the community; and disclosure of any gap between the company’s CSR and the guide’s requirements. The guide emphasizes the importance of shareholders, employees, customers, and environmental protection. It clearly states that to build a harmonious society, China should increase the social responsibility of the citizens, business enterprises, and all kinds of other organizations. It aims to increase banking/ﬁnancial institutions’ sense of social responsibility. It states that banking/ﬁnancial institutions’ fulﬁllment of their social responsibility is a must for building a harmonious society. Social responsibility is a product of the in-depth development of economic globalization, and it represents the values, language, and code of conduct commonly recognized by the governments, enterprises, and other institutions of all countries for realizing coordinated economic and social development in the course of globalization. The socialist market economy, sustainable economic development, and social progress of China all depend on enterprises increasing their sense of social responsibility. These guidelines are proposed to comprehensively implement the spirit of the 17th CPC National Congress and the Scientiﬁc Outlook on Development and give the impetus to SOEs directly under the central government to earnestly fulﬁll corporate social responsibilities so as to realize a coordinated and sustainable development of enterprises, society, and the environment in all respects. Fulﬁlling CSRs is a practical action taken by central SOEs to apply the Scientiﬁc Outlook on Development and is an overall social requirement for central SOEs. CSR reports must be fulﬁlled by central SOEs to realize sustainable development and to participate in international economic cooperation. It includes 80 criteria for corporate social responsibility in categories such as energy, environmental protection, production safety, product safety, employee protection, and protection of disadvantaged social groups. It encourages business enterprises to actively involve themselves in CSR activities. Downloaded from informs.org by [131.193.251.47] on 02 August 2017, at 16:17 .

Principles of sustainable development of state-owned enterprises during 12th Five-Year Plan period Date Issuing organization Key content September 2011 State-owned Assets The guide proposes that sustainable development should be Supervision and Administration Commission the core of corporate social responsibilities, and state-owned enterprises should be harmonious in development with society and the environment. The state-owned enterprises should be a role model for social responsibility. Note. We have reported examples beyond our observation period (2006–2009) to show that the Chinese government continues to issue legitimacy guidelines on the focal issue. ), “opinions” ( Endnotes 1Note that almost all of these communications between the government and business enterprises have used terms ), such as “guidelines/guide” ( ) and “recommended practices” ( ), and “outlines” ( have almost never used terms such as “policies” ( ) and “enforcement/regulations” ( ). So although these commu- nications are not explicitly coercive, the government signal is clear: enterprises are encouraged to engage in CSR activities. 2We acknowledge that issuing more detailed reports could just be a more elaborate form of decoupling whereby ﬁrms fab- ricate the speciﬁc details of their CSR activities. Below, we discuss some supplementary research and analysis suggesting that assessing the level of detail and substance of the CSR report does correspond to substantive CSR implementation. 3Before these reforms, the ﬁnancial organization of the Com- munist state was highly centralized, even more so than in other Communist countries (Walder 2000). Industrial invest- ment, savings rates, the extraction of economic value, and the prices of products and services were all controlled by the cen- tral planning system. 4To further verify that using the RKS data was a valid way to assess the substantiveness of CSR reporting, we investigated the CSR activities and reporting (from the ﬁrm’s websites and press releases as well as from its CSR report) of the ﬁve highest-scoring and ﬁve lowest-scoring ﬁrms. For example, the Ping’an report, which earned the highest score of all the 2009 reports, included detailed systematic information about the ﬁrm’s CSR activities. The report that earned the lowest evaluation discussed only the ﬁrm’s CSR activities generally and brieﬂy. We also checked correlations between each RKS rating and two other indications of CSR report substantiveness: page count and the use of GRI 3.0 guidelines. The correlations were 0.82 and 0.60, respectively, which provided convergent validity for our measure. Finally, we interviewed consultants at two CSR consulting ﬁrms (one China-based and one inter- national) that help ﬁrms produce CSR reports. We showed them the RKS list of items and methodology and asked if they felt that higher scores would be reliable indicators of more substantive CSR activity. Both felt that, because of the speci- ﬁcity of the items measured, they were virtually certain that such reporting indicated greater CSR implementation. These investigations left us conﬁdent that the RKS data are a valid representation of the substantiveness of CSR reporting. 5In robustness checks, we also used a continuous variable of the ownership percentage. The results are consistent with what we present in the paper, except that one of the interaction effects becomes marginally signiﬁcant. Results are available from the authors on request. 6In previous research, the concept of a CEO’s political con- nection was measured by a dummy variable equal to 1 if the CEO was either a member of the NPC or the CPPCC or a government ofﬁcial (Fan et al. 2007, Li et al. 2006). However, our theoretical approach distinguishes between membership in political congresses and bureaucratic embeddedness. 7The corporate governance group was initiated by the Shanghai Stock Exchange to promote better corporate gover- nance structure. Corporations on the exchange can apply to be included. Applications are evaluated and either accepted or rejected by a special committee organized by the exchange. In general, companies in this group are thought to have better governance practices. 8Note that just because a ﬁrm’s characteristics suggest it would be required to issue a report does not mean that the ﬁrm did so. In our sample, of the ﬁrms that were required to issue a report in a given year, 31% did not. Excluding required ﬁrms from the analysis of ﬁrms issuing CSR reports did not change the results. 9Because including Yt−1 as a regressor could create an autocor- relation risk, as a robustness check, we ran the models without Yt−1 and obtained similar results. 10These categories are agriculture, forestry, livestock farming, ﬁshery; mining; manufacturing; electric power, gas, and water production and supply; construction; transport and storage; information technology; wholesale and retail trade; ﬁnance and insurance; real estate; social service; communication and cul- ture; and others. 11In supplementary analyses, we examined whether different types of industries were more likely to issue CSR reports or to provide more substantive reports. Of particular interest were those industries that are more closely connected to the government, for example, by being more regulated. However, these investigations did not produce any statistically signiﬁcant relationships. 12We conducted two alternative speciﬁcations as robustness checks. First, we ran random effects models (xtlogit and xtreg) as an alternative way to control for multiple observations per ﬁrm. Results were identical to those we report. (We were unable to implement ﬁxed effects because of the limited num- ber of observations per ﬁrm and because some of our variables are time-invariant.) We used the standard logit and OLS mod- els with robust standard errors for ease of interpretation. Fur- thermore, we also estimated these two analyses as a two-stage Heckman selection model (Heckman 1979) with the variable Downloaded from informs.org by [131.193.251.47] on 02 August 2017, at 16:17 .

Organization Science 25(1), pp. 127–148, © 2014 INFORMS stock market exchange as the instrument. Signiﬁcance levels of hypothesized coefﬁcients and resulting interpretations are identical. This is a potentially valid way to test our predic- tions because our two dependent variables are interrelated in such a way that the rating of CSR reporting substantiveness is contingent on whether the focal ﬁrm has issued a CSR report. Furthermore, it is arguable that stock market exchange serves as a valid instrument because, during our time period, the two stock exchanges had different policies and guidelines on whether a ﬁrm should report, but neither made speciﬁc requirements about the quality of the reports. These results are available from the authors on request. 13Note that this is only 83% of the 954 CSR reports that have been issued since 2006 because the RKS data are only avail- able for 2008 and 2009. 14Further robustness checks with the inteff procedure in Stata indicate that the coefﬁcients of the interaction term between private control and ﬁrm age and the interaction term between private control and slack resources were both statistically sig- niﬁcant (Hoetker 2007, Norton et al. 2004), which provides further evidence that our results are robust.
