Strategic managers are consistently faced with the decision of how to allocate scarce corporate  resources in an environment that is placing more and more pressures on them. Recent  scholarship in strategic management suggests that many of these pressures come directly from  sources associated with social issues in management, rather than traditional arenas of strategic  management.

Recent scholarship  in strategic management suggests that many of  these pressures are coming directly not from tra-  ditional concerns of strategic management but  instead from concerns about social issues in man-  agement (see, for example, Prahalad and Hamel,  1994). Strategic resource allocation decisions  have always been complex, but now they are  even more so, since companies are assessed not  only on the financial outcome of their decisions  but also on the ways in which their companies  measure up to a broader set of societal expec-  tations.  try-based competitive forces identified by Porter  (1980). Changing customer expectations, regula-  tory shifts, problem of excess capacity (and pre-  sumably the associated employees), and environ-  mental concerns are now becoming important  influences on strategy (Prahalad and Hamel,  1994). These emerging influences on strategic  decision making are the result of the impact of  different stakeholder expectations (Freeman,  1984) and a company's interactions with a range  of stakeholders arguably comprise its overall cor-  porate social performance record (cf. Wood,  1991a, 1991b; Waddock, 1996). To illustrate the  importance of such influences on companies, it  should be noted that investors now hold some  $650 billion in social investment funds. Within  may of the investment houses that run these so-  called socially responsible investment funds are  analysts who carefully screen potential invest-  ments both on financial and social performance  criteria.  ences on strategic decisions now come from  influences that go well beyond traditional indus-  Prahalad and Hamel (1994) indicate that influ-  Key words: corporate social performance; social  responsibility; financial performance; management qual-  ity  Further, watchdog groups like the Council on  Economic Priorities (CEP) have long evaluated  company performance on a range of social dimen-  sions.

More recently inde-  pendent services have sprung up that evaluate  companies' social performance across a broad  range of 'social' activities and sell that infor-  mation to the investment community. As a result,  these ratings are now available to the investment  community as input to investor decisions. These  ratings services seem to be having an effect on  some investment decisions, which is evident in  research that shows that institutional investors are  favorably inclined toward companies with higher  corporate social performance when other factors  are held constant and independent information  about CSP is available (Teoh and Shiu, 1990;  Graves and Waddock, 1994).  Despite these developments, the linkages  between CSP and financial performance are still  far from clear (Ullman, 1985). Results of empiri-  cal work indicate an ambiguous relationship (e.g.,  Alexander and Buchholz, 1982; Aupperle, Carroll  and Hatfield, 1985; Ullman, 1985; Shane and  Spicer, 1983). Further, even when a positive link  is established (e.g., Wokutch and Spencer, 1987;  McGuire, Schneeweiss and Sundgren, 1988), it  is still unclear whether financially successful com-  panies simply have more resources to spend on  CSP and therefore attain a higher standard (a  slack resources theory) or whether better perform-  ance along various dimensions of CSP itself  results in better financial outcomes (which we  will characterize as good management theory)  (McGuire et al., 1988; Ullman, 1985).  Using a greatly improved source of data on  corporate social performance, this paper reports  the results of a rigorous study of the empirical  linkages between financial and social perform-  ance. With a broad-based index of corporate  social performance, we test whether there is a  positive relationship between CSP and financial  performance and whether both slack resource and  good management theory may be operating simul-  taneously.  CSP. CSP is a multidimensional construct, with  behaviors ranging across a wide variety of inputs  (e.g., investments in pollution control equipment  or other environmental strategies), internal  behaviors or processes (e.g., treatment of women  and minorities, nature of products produced,  relationships with customers), and outputs (e.g.,  community relations and philanthropic programs)  (see Wood, 1991a, 1991b; Aupperle et al., 1985;  Wolfe and Aupperle, 1991; Aupperle, 1991;  Miles, 1987 Gephart, 1991). These behaviors  also occur across a wide range of industries with  significantly different characteristics, histories,  and performance in the different CSP domains  (see Waddock and Graves, 1994). Further,  numerous issues, managerial decisions, and cor-  porate behaviors are encompassed by the term  CSP (Wood, 1991a, 1991b; Lydenberg, Marlin,  and Strub, 1986). As a result, little clarity has  been reached on measurement of CSP, and the  measures used in empirical work have frequently  been one-dimensional, and have been applied to  small samples of companies. There is a clear need  for a multidimensional measure applied across  a wide range of industries and larger samples  of companies.  CSP measures used in the past have included  forced-choice survey instruments (Aupperle,  1991; Aupperle et al., 1985), the Fortune repu-  tational and social responsibility index or Mos-  kowitz' reputational scales (Bowman and Haire,  1975; McGuire et al., 1988; O'Bannon and Pres-  ton, 1993), content analysis of documents (Wolfe,  1991), behavioral and perceptual measures  (Wokutch and McKinney, 1991), and case study  methodologies resembling social audits (Clarkson,  1991). In some instances social disclosure has  been used as a surrogate for CSP (e.g., Preston,  1978; Abbott and Monson, 1979; Ingram, 1978).  Pollution control investments are another fre-  quently used one-dimensional measure (e.g.,  Bowman and Haire, 1975; Chen and Metcalf,  1980; Spicer, 1978; Shane and Spicer, 1983).  Each of these measurements, while offering  some benefits, has limitations. Survey method-  ologies have problems relating to return rates and  consistency of raters across a variety of firms.  The Fortune rating of CSP tends to be viewed  as a measure of overall management of a firm  rather than being specific to CSP. Further, it is  highly correlated with other measures. Content  analysis of existing documents, while yielding  THE MEASUREMENT PROBLEM  One fundamental reason for the uncertainty about  the relationship between CSP and financial per-  formance is that a serious problem has plagued  researchers to date: the problem of measuring This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 02:06:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  valuable insights into corporate behavior, depends  to a large extent on the comprehensiveness and  purposes for which the documents were originally  created and can be biased by omission or  inclusion. Case study methodologies, by their na-  ture, can be applied to only a limited sampling  of companies; further, although significant prog-  ress has been made (e.g., Clarkson, 1991), there  are problems of consistency across cases studied  by different research teams. Social disclosure and  pollution control investments are unidimensional  measures. Thus, many measures are either unidi-  mensional and may not properly reflect the overall  level of a company's CSP or they are difficult  to apply consistently across the range of industries  and companies that need to be studied.  So problematic has been the measurement  problem that an entire section of the annual  research volume Research in Corporate Social  Performance and Policy was devoted to this topic  (see Wolfe and Aupperle, 1991, for the introduc-  tion to this special section). The research we  report in this paper attempts to overcome some  of the measurement problems that in the past  have hindered examination of the strategic links  between firms' CSP and financial performance.  As noted, many empirical studies of CSP tend  to focus on only one or two areas of social  performance while ignoring the rest. It is difficult  to construct a truly representative CSP measure  in part because of its complexity and because  measurements of a single dimension provide too  limited a perspective on how well a company is  actually performing in the relevant social domains  (Lydenberg et al., 1986; Wolfe and Aupperle,  1991). In part because of the measurement diffi-  culties, previous findings on the relationship  between profitability and corporate social per-  formance have been mixed. Some find tenuous  positive linkages (McGuire et al., 1988; McGuire,  Schneeweiss and Branch, 1990; Aupperle et al.,  1985), others find clear positive relationships  (Cochran and Wood, 1984), while others docu-  ment negative linkages (Shane and Spicer, 1983).  It is simply unclear at this point whether linkages  between financial performance and CSP exist,  and if so whether they are positive or negative  (Aupperle et al., 1985). Ullman provides a com-  prehensive review of the mixed results up to  1985, concluding, in fact, that 'the situation per-  taining to relationships among social performance,  social disclosure, and economic performance can This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 02:06:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  Social-Financial Performance Link 305  best be characterized at this time as empirical  data in search of an adequate theory' (1985: 555).  HYPOTHESES  In forming our hypotheses, it is evident that there  are two issues to address: (1) the sign of the  relationship, and (2) the direction of causation  (O'Bannon and Preston, 1993). The sign of the  relationship may indicate negative, neutral, or  positive linkages between CSP and financial per-  formance. Separately, it is possible that changes  in CSP influence financial performance, or the  opposite, that change in financial performance  influence CSP. Together, these two issues result  in a total of six possible hypotheses (O'Bannon  and Preston, 1993). Below we recount the argu-  ments for these different hypotheses.  Negative association  Those arguing for a negative relationship beween  social and financial performance believe that firms  that perform responsibly incur a competitive dis-  advantage (Aupperle et al., 1985) because they  are incurring costs that might otherwise be  avoided or that should be borne by others (e.g.,  individuals or government). An example of this  kind of action would be the decision to invest in  pollution control equipment when other competi-  tors do not. According to this line of thinking,  which is fundamental to Friedman's (1970) and  other neoclassical economists' arguments, there  are few readily measurable economic benefits to  socially responsible behavior while there are  numerous costs. The costs, by this argument, fall  directly to the bottom line, reducing profits and  thus shareholder wealth. These theorists expect  the relationship between CSP and financial per-  formance to be negative.  Neutral association  The empirical results to date lend themselves  to a second possibility: that there is simply no  relationship, positive or negative, between social  and financial performance. Proponents of this line  of reasoning (e.g., Ullman, 1985) argue that there  are so many intervening variables between social  and financial performance that there is no reason  to expect a relationship to exist, except possibly  306 S. A. Waddock and S. B. Graves  by chance. On the other hand, the measurement  problems that have plagued CSP research may  mask any linkage that exists.  Positive association  The third perspective, based on stakeholder analy-  sis, proposes that a tension exists between the  firm's explicit costs (e.g., payments to  bondholders) and its implicit costs to other stake-  holders (e.g., product quality costs, environmental  costs). This theory predicts that a firm that  attempts to lower its implicit costs by socially  irresponsible actions will, as a result, incur higher  explicit costs, resulting in competitive disadvan-  tage. According to this argument, then, there is  a positive relationship between CSP and finan-  cial performance.  Finally, some take the position that high levels  of CSP are indicators of superior management  skill, and thus lead to lower explicit costs  (Alexander and Buchholz, 1982), a perspective  that would tend to be supported by the high  correlations among Fortune's indicators of good  management and social performance. The weight  of these arguments about the potential positive  benefits of CSP suggests to us that the sign  of any relationship between financial and social  performance will be positive, hence we will  hypothesize that the relationship between social  and financial performance is a positive one.  DIRECTION OF CAUSALITY: SLACK  RESOURCES OR GOOD  MANAGEMENT?  A compatible view is that the actual costs of  CSP are minimal and the benefits potentially  great. For example, an enlightened employee  relations policy may have a very low cost, but  can result in substantial gains in morale and  productivity, actually yielding a competitive  advantage in comparison to less responsible firms.  Firms that are reported in lists of 'best companies  to work for', for example, may find it easier to  recruit top quality employees, possibly resulting  in increases in productivity at relatively low cost  (e.g., Moskowitz, 1972). Although this argument  is a fundamentally normative one, there is a  recent emphasis in strategic management on the  construction of meaningful strategies that empha-  size the importance of core values to which  employees and other key stakeholders can relate.  Sometimes this 'meaning-making' is called stra-  tegic intent (e.g., Hamel and Prahalad, 1989).  Others term it purpose (Bartlett and Ghoshal,  1994) or enterprise strategy, which is explicit  about what the corporation 'stands for' in the  linkages between its values and strategy (Freeman  and Gilbert, 1988).  In any case, strategic postures with an overlay  of social and other normatively defined purposes  have historically been held in low regard as  possible sources of competitive advantage. These  new ideas in strategic management, however, sug-  gest that such socially embedded purposes and  strategic postures may be related to positive stra-  tegic outcomes in important ways. By extension,  such purposes may have positive impact on fi-  nancial performance as well.  The second aspect of the CSP-financial perform-  ance relationship has to do with the direction of  causality. Two views, mentioned earlier, can be  contrasted and tested empirically. We will call  the first the slack resources theory and the second  the good management theory.  Slack resources  Slack resource theorists argue that better financial  performance potentially results in the availability  of slack (financial and other) resources that pro-  vide the opportunity for companies to invest in  social performance domains, such as community  relations, employee relations, or environment  (e.g., IBM's or Digital Equipment Corporation's  philanthropy programs during earlier good times).  If slack resources are available, then better social  performance would result from the allocation of  these resources into the social domains, and thus  better financial performance would be a predictor  of better CSP. Some of the empirical evidence,  particularly that of McGuire and colleagues  (1988, 1990), provides support for the slack  resources theory.  Good management  Good management theorists argue, alternatively,  that there is a high correlation between good  management practice, and CSP, simply because  attention to CSP domains improves relationships  with key stakeholder groups (e.g. Freeman, This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 02:06:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  1984), resulting in better overall performance.  For example, good employee (including women  and minorities) relations might be expected to  enhance morale, productivity, and satisfaction.  Excellent community relations might provide  incentives for local government to provide com-  petition-enhancing tax breaks (e.g., Dayton Hud-  son's anti-takeover campaign), improved schools  (and a better workforce over the long term), or  reduced regulation, thereby reducing costs to the  firm and improving the bottom line.  Further, positive customer perceptions about  the quality and nature of a company's products,  its environmental awareness, and its government  and community relations, are increasingly becom-  ing bases of competition (cf. Prahalad and Hamel,  1994), blurring the lines between good manage-  ment practice and 'social' performance. Such  positive perceptions of the firm by outside stake-  holders may lead to increased sales or reduced  stakeholder management costs. The work of  McGuire and colleagues (1988, 1990) also sup-  ports the good management theory in that it  provides empirical support for financial perform-  ance as the dependent variable.  Following these latter findings and based on  McGuire et al. (1990), we hypothesize that CSP  is both a predictor and consequence of firm fi-  nancial performance. That is, there is a simul-  taneous relationship, or a kind of 'virtuous circle',  such that:  Hypothesis 1: Better financial performance  results in improved CSP, ceteris paribus.  Hypothesis 2: Improved CSP leads to better  financial performance, ceteris paribus.  METHOD  Measuring CSP  To deal with the measurement problems noted  above, we constructed an index of CSP (as pro-  posed by Ullman, 1985), based on the eight  corporate social performance attributes rated con-  sistently across the entire Standard and Poors 500  by the firm Kinder, Lydenberg, Domini (KLD).'

KLD's rating scheme makes several advances  beyond those used in earlier research. First, all  companies in the S&P 500 are rated. Second,  each company is rated on multiple attributes con-  sidered relevant to CSP. Third, a single group of  researchers, working independently from the rated  companies or any particular brokerage house,  applies the same set of criteria to related compa-  nies. Fourth, the criteria are applied consistently  across a wide range of companies, with data  gathered from a range of sources, both internal  and external to the firm.  As noted, KLD rates companies on eight attri-  butes of CSP, providing a multidimensional  assessment. Five of the rated attributes emphasize  key stakeholder relations that might be included  among those emphasized as important emerging  influences on corporate strategy (Prahalad and  Hamel, 1994), specifically, community relations,  employee relations, performance with respect to  the environment, product characteristics, and  treatment of women and minorities. These five  are rated on scales ranging from -2 (major  concerns) to neutral to +2 (major strength). Three  of the attributes are less directly related to stake-  holder groups but encompass areas in which com-  panies have received significant external pressures  in recent years. These areas are military con-  tracting, participation in nuclear power, and  involvement in South Africa (relevant during the  time period of analysis); these are rated only  from -2 (major concern) to 0 (neutral) because  KLD awards no positive assessment of activities  in these domains.  In each of the areas, KLD investigates a range  of sources to determine, for example, whether the  company has paid fines or penalties in an area  (for concerns) or has major strengths in the area  (e.g., strong family policies for the Employee  Relations category). Appendix 1 provides details  on the factors used in determining ratings for  each of the eight categories. Where possible,  KLD uses quantitative criteria to determine the  rating (e.g., dollar amount paid in fines or penal-  ties; percentage of employees receiving certain  kinds of benefits). Judgement is necessary, of  course, in the determination of the cutoff point  for a negative rating, as well as in borderline  308 S. A. Waddock and S. B. Graves  case and in interpretation of qualitative criteria  (e.g., an excellent employee or community  relations program). KLD staff members meet on  a weekly basis to discuss borderline cases and  assure that decisions on ratings are being made  in a consistent manner across companies and from  year to year.  KLD uses a variety of sources to capture social  performance data about each company. Each  company's investor relations office is sent a  yearly questionnaire about CSP practices and  KLD maintains continuing relations with investor  relations offices to assure the accuracy of data.  KLD maintains the independence and integrity of  its ratings, but the firm is willing to respond to  company concerns where accuracy is at issue.  Corporate data sources include annual reports,  10K forms, proxy statements, and quarterly  reports, as well as reports issued for specific  CSP arenas, such as environment and community.  External data sources include articles about a  company in the general business press (e.g. For-  tune, Business Week, Wall St. Journal), trade  magazines, and general media. KLD staffers also  draw on relevant articles on companies from pe-  riodicals such as the Chronicle of Philanthropy,  regional Environmental Protection Agency news-  letters, academic journals, and, for legal or regu-  latory issues, such as fines and penalties, the  National Law Journal. External surveys and rat-  ings are also used, where appropriate, for instance  Working Mother's listing of the 100 best compa-  nies for women to work for.  attributes, perform trade-offs among the attributes,  then construct a scale. Values from 0 to 100  were derived, representing the relative importance  of each attribute to the overall index. Normalized  values were averaged across the panelists and a  weighted average CSP index was computed for  each company. A Friedman's nonparametric  analysis of variance indicated that the ratings of  each panelist were not significantly different from  each other. The index developed is statistically  the same as that used by Ruf, Muralidhar and  Paul (1993) and reported in Graves and Wad-  dock (1994).  We believe that this weighting scheme deals  with the problem of shifting of the relative impor-  tance of items in the KLD rating over time and  with changing social standards (cf. Preston and  Post, 1975). For example, South Africa, nuclear,  and military involvement, which carry low weight  in the index, seem in terms of face validity to  have relatively less importance to the currently  emerging construct of CSP than do the more  stakeholder-oriented measures of community, pro-  duct, employee relations, diversity (women and  minority), and environment. The actual weighting  by our panel of experts reflects this common  sense.  Raw CSP data were taken from KLD as of  1990. For the models that treated CSP as a  dependent variable, financial data from 1989 were  used. For the models that treated financial per-  formance (profitability) as the dependent variable,  we took profitability in 1991 as the dependent  variable and used 1990 data for CSP and con-  trol variables.  Each attribute in the KLD scheme is implicitly  given equal weighting, ranging from major con-  cern (2 X's), concern (1 X), no concern (neutral),  to strength and major strength. In our weighting  scheme, major concern was given an index of  -2, while major strength equaled +2. Because  experts on CSP consider certain attributes to be  more important to an overall assessment of CSP  than others at any given time (Preston and Post,  1975), the authors developed a panel of three  experts from the Social Issues in Management  division of the Academy of Management, who  had been active in the social issues arena for  more than 15 years, and asked them to help  construct an appropriate weighting scheme for  the index.  Using the simple multiattribute rating technique  (SMART) (Von Winterfeldt and Edwards, 1986),  we asked each panelist to evaluate the eight CSP  Control variables  Because size, risk, and industry have been sug-  gested in previous articles to be factors that affect  both firm performance and CSP (e.g., Ullman,  1985), each of these characteristics was oper-  ationalized as a control variable. Size is a relevant  variable because there is some evidence that  smaller firms may not exhibit as many overt  socially responsible behaviors as do larger firms.  Perhaps this is the case because as they mature  and grow, firms attract more attention from exter-  nal constituents and need to respond more openly  to stakeholder demands (cf. Burke et al., 1986).  Management's risk tolerance influences its atti-  tude toward activities that have the potential to This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 02:06:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  (1) elicit savings (e.g., a recycling or waste  reduction effort, costly at first but potentially  money saving in the long run, such as 3M Cor-  poration's Pollution Prevention Pays program; (2)  incur future or present costs (e.g., pollution con-  trol equipment that helps avoid future fines), or  (3) build (environmentally friendly firm) or  destroy (perceived as unfriendly to certain types  of people) markets. As a proxy for management's  risk tolerance, we use the level of debt held by  the firm.  Finally, earlier research (Graves and Waddock,  1994) has shown that clear differences in per-  formance and levels of R&D investment exist  among different industries. A quick scan of  Table 1 suggests that unless the overall differ-  ences in CSP among industries are controlled for,  understanding the main effects may blurred, since  depending on its characteristics, an industry may  or may not experience significant problems in a  given social arena. Controlling for industry takes  these differences into account.  Firm size was measured by total assets and by  total sales. As a proxy for the riskiness of a firm,  we used the long-term debt to total assets ratio.  Industry was determined by 4-digit SIC (see  Table 1) and represented in the model by dummy  variables. All financial data were derived from  COMPUSTAT tapes.  Financial performance  Firm financial performance (profitability) was  measured using three accounting variables: return  Social-Financial Performance Link 309  on assets, return on equity, and return on sales,  providing a range of measures used to assess  corporate financial performance by the invest-  ment community.  Analysis  Table 1 gives a listing of the industries, SIC  codes, and average industry CSP ratings, Table 2  gives descriptive statistics for all variables used in  the study, and Table 3 gives the relative weights  assigned to each CSP attribute. Regression analy-  sis was used to test our hypotheses, first using  CSP as the dependent variable, while controlling  for size (three size measures were used: total  sales, total assets, and number of employees),  debt level, and industry, then using profitability  as the dependent variable and employing the same  control variables.

These panelist ratings are consistent with other  research on stakeholder rankings of the KLD data  (Ruf et al., 1993; Graves and Waddock, 1994)  as well as assessments of the validity of the KLD  rankings compared to other potential measures of  CSP (e.g., Sharfman, 1993).  Table 4 provides the correlation matrices for  the key variables. Table 4(a) shows 1989 financial  data and 1990 CSP. These data were used for  the models which treated CSP as the dependent  variable. Table 4(b) shows correlations between  1991 profitability (ROA, ROE, ROS) and 1990  CSP and financial controls. These data were used  for the models which treated financial perform-  ance (profitability) as the dependent variable.  Note first that CSP is positively and significantly  correlated at p < 0.10 or better with all three of  the financial performance measures (ROA, return  on assets; ROE, return on equity; ROS, return  on sales) for the 1989 financial data, and with  those measures at the p ' 0.05 level or better  for the correlations with the 1991 financial data.  Further, we can see from Table 4 that the three  financial variables are highly correlated with each  other (at p < 0.001 for all three variables), as  would be expected.  Table 5 presents the results of the regression  analysis using CSP as the dependent variable and  financial performance as the independent variable,  controlling for debt, size, and industry (industry  controls are omitted from the table in the interest  of space), using a 1-year lag between the financial  performance (1989 data) and the CSP measure-  ment (1990 data). In all nine of these models,  corporate social performance is the dependent  variable and measurement of the key independent  variable, financial performance, varies. Models  1-3 present the result using ROA as the key  independent variable and controlling for debt,  industry, and size (with size measured three ways,  yielding the different models).  As can be seen (Table 5), each of the models  RESULTS  A total of 469 companies remained in the sample  after companies missing either financial or CSP  data were eliminated. As can be seen in Table 1,  there are considerable differences in the ratings  among industries, with the lowest CSP rated  industry being refining, rubber, and plastic (SIC  2891-3199) at -0.52. Other heavy manufacturing  and extraction industries (e.g., mining, construc-  tion at -0.22, chemicals and pharmaceuticals at  -0.15 and containers, steel, and heavy manufac-  turing at -0.14) also rated considerably lower  than less manufacturing-intensive industries,  which scored much higher on the CSP rating  (e.g., banking and financial services at 0.13 and  wholesaling and retailing at 0.11). Note from  Table 1 that most industries (9 out of 13) were  rated below 0 on the overall CSP scoring and  that only those industries not engaged in activities  as likely to have significant CSP consequences  (e.g., environmental impact or community,  employee, and product-related issues) were rated  positively on overall CSP. These descriptive  results indicate the importance of controlling for  industry in the assessment of the relationship  between financial and CSP performance.  310 S. A. Waddock and S. B.

Table 3 shows the panel's weighting of the  CSP attributes in the KLD data base. As can  be seen, employee relations, product, community  relations, environment, and treatment of women  and minorities (now called diversity) were con-  sidered more important than the three issues of  nuclear power, military contracts, and South  Africa, which today would likely not be con-  sidered important at all.

The results are less strong,  but still significant at p < 0.10 when the financial  variable used is ROE (Models 4-6) and at  p < 0.05 when the independent financial variable  is return on sales (Models 7-9).

When profitability is measured by ROE, the  relationship, while in the same direction, is not  significant (Models 4-6); however, when the  financial variable ROS is used, each model is  significant at the p < 0.05 level (Models 7-9).  In these models there is a consistently negative  and significant relationship between debt-to-asset  ratio and CSP. The size effect is significantly  negative in the first three models, and negative  in all but two cases.  better financial performance leads to improved  CSP. CSP is negatively related to debt-to-asset  ratio in each of the first nine models, but is only  significant (p < 0.10) when ROE is used. Size  shows no significant relationship in any of these  models; its sign is negative in all but two  instances.  Our second hypothesis proposed that improved  CSP results in improved financial performance.  Using a 1-year lag for financial performance  (1991 data) and the 1990 CSP data (and 1990  financial control variables), we performed a set  of regression analyses using the financial perform-  ance variables, ROA, ROE, and ROS as the  dependent variables and CSP as the independent  variable, while again controlling for debt, size  (measured three ways), and industry. As can be  seen (Table 6), the results generally support the  hypothesis that financial performance depends on  CSP. In the ROA models (Models 1-3) there is  a significant relationship between ROA and CSP  (p< 0.01) when size is measured by sales;  p < 0.001 when size is measured by total assets;  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS  This study has attempted to address what has  become a perennial question: whether corporate  social performance is linked to financial perform-  ance and, if so, in what direction the causation  runs. In undertaking the study, we are exploring  whether or not strategic linkages exist between  CSP behaviors and financial performance.

Our data set  included most the S&P 500 firms.  In support of those studies that have found  positive linkages in the past (e.g., Cochran and  Wood, 1984; McGuire et al., 1988, 1990; Aup-  perle et al., 1985), we found, using this improved  measure, that CSP does depend on financial per-  formance and that the sign of the relationship is  positive. That is, in support of the slack resources  theory, firms with slack resources potentially  available from strong financial performance may  have greater freedom to invest in positive CSP.  Thus, it may well be that firms with available  resources may choose to spend those resources  on 'doing good by doing well', and that those  resource allocations may result in improved  CSP overall.

Such resource  allocations may be strategically linked to  improvements in long-term image and relation-  ships with the communities with which it must  interact. If, as will be discussed below, CSP is  redefined to encompass critical stakeholder  relations, as the measure used in the present study  does, then expenditures on CSP activities are far  from discretionary and may actually be strategic  because they encompass daily corporate life.  Further, we found (in a kind of simultaneous  relationship) that financial performance also  depends on good social performance, suggesting This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 02:06:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  314 S. A. Waddock and S. B. Graves  that there is something about performing well in  social arenas that may be simply linked to good  managerial practice. Thus, in support of what we  termed the 'good management theory', firms may  also 'do well by doing good', to turn the phrase  used above. This finding provides support for  researchers using the Fortune reputational index  in the past (McGuire et al., 1988, 1990; O'Ban-  non and Preston, 1993), who have implicitly sug-  gested that there may be a linkage between good  management and good social performance.  A virtuous circle?  As we consider the relationship between the first  and second hypothesis, we can begin to speculate  that wherever the cycle begins, whether in an  initial availability of slack resources or in initial  attention to the social performance dimensions,  there may be a simultaneous and interactive  impact, possibly forming what we earlier termed  a virtuous circle. The impact appears to be posi-  tive: better CSP, based on these findings, seems  to be positively related to better financial per-  formance, whichever measure we choose as the  dependent variable. We interpret this finding to  mean that causation may run in both directions.  That is, better financial performance may lead to  improved CSP. Also, better CSP may lead to  improved financial performance, ceteris paribus.  The first finding, if upheld in future research,  would be explained by the slack resources theory.  The second finding is somewhat more difficult  to explain. At this point in the research, we can  forward only tentative, yet plausible, explanations.  First, meeting stakeholder expectations in advance  of their becoming problematic may simply reflect  proactive attention to domains that others  (Prahalad and Hamel, 1994) have recognized as  becoming increasingly important. Such concerns  reflect a variety of stakeholder interests, thereby  aligning stakeholder interests more closely to the  very definition of CSP than previous research has  done and making these stakeholder relations more  prominent in the link to financial performance.  Importantly, the heavier weights in the CSP index  are those that most closely represent critical  stakeholders, such as employees, customers, and  community, while less directly stakeholder-related  categories of involvement in nuclear industries,  military contracting, or South Africa receive con-  siderably less weight.  Alternatively, the positive finding may rep-  resent (at least initially) simple 'posturing' on  the part of companies to improve their external  reputations, possibly boost employee morale, and  improve investor relations, and hence may not be  real at all. According to this explanation, good  managers may not be fully committed to  improved CSP, but they may recognize that cer-  tain benefits may be gained by appearing to  support social performance goals. Such managers  might pursue social performance goals just  enough to avoid significant bad publicity, but  may do so at a minimum investment. Although  this possibility is somewhat obviated by the  higher weights on the key stakeholder relation-  ships encompassed by the CSP measure, it does  remain a possibility until these relationships are  explored in more depth.  Although the comprehensiveness of the KLD  data on CSP mitigate somewhat the posturing  hypothesis because the data are gathered across  such a wide range of activities and behaviors, it is  entirely possible firms wishing to appear socially  responsible will initially engage in posturing  behaviors only to find that over time, they have  actually institutionalized cultural or strategic  changes in what Mintzberg (1987) has termed  emergent strategy. We can speculate, for example,  that CSP expenditures, whether derived from real  strategic intent or posturing behaviors, may, once  implemented, result in actual improved attention  to key external and internal stakeholders, such as  customers (via products that meet real needs),  communities and the environment, or employees,  including women and minorities. Alternatively,  they may provide benefits beyond their costs that  are eventually reflected in financial performance.  Our findings indicate minimally that attention  to CSP arenas does not represent a competitive  disadvantage and may in fact be a competitive  advantage. If, for example, better performance  along CSP dimensions allows companies to attract  better employees more easily, forego difficult and  costly battles for site placement with communities  or governmental officials, or avoid payments of  fines for environmental problems, then potentially  we are changing the definition of CSP so that it  no longer represents a discretionary activity on  the part of management (Carroll, 1979), but is  fundamentally linked to management performance  itself. Thus, stakeholder relations are corporate  social performance in this new definition and This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 02:06:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  expenditures in key stakeholder domains become  an important element of improved corporate per-  formance as well as improved CSP.  It is thus entirely possible that there are direct  linkages between the overall quality of manage-  ment and CSP, with the clear implication that  good CSP and good management may be one  and the same thing if CSP is measured and  defined properly, that is, if CSP is defined in  terms of stakeholder relations considered critical  to firm performance and not as simply discretion-  ary activities, such as philanthropy or corporate  volunteerism. Even if CSP and quality of manage-  ment can be differentiated, the meaning-making  that goes with creating strong social performance  may elicit greater loyalty to firms from two  important constituencies: employees and cus-  tomers, while simultaneously providing at least  certain categories of owners (i.e., those with  social concerns) even more reason to invest in a  particular firm.  The data used in this study support that latter  notion, indicating that it may pay to give attention  to dimensions of management that are normally  outside of strict financial, productivity, and  efficiency considerations. The components of the  CSP index encompass a range of social concerns  not always considered central strategic issues,  but which can now be considered important to  performance (cf. Prahalad and Hamel, 1994),  when factors such as company size, industry, and  debt (or risk) level are taken into account. That  is, good management and its reflection in financial  outcomes may also encompass the nature of prod-  ucts produced, a company's posture with respect  to the natural environment, its relations to  employees, including women and minorities, and  its community relations, among others.  Implications for future research  Much remains to be learned about the relationship  between CSP and financial performance, which  has been explored in the present study. For  example, as more CSP data become available it  would be useful to determine whether or not  the relationships that we have examined hold  consistently over time. Additionally, it would be  useful to examine lags other than the 1-year time  period used in the present study. Further, if qual-  ity of management is a critical variable in finan-  cial outcomes, as the relationships identified in  Social-Financial Performance Link 315  this study suggest, then controlling for the quality  of management while assessing the CSP-financial  performance link might also be beneficial. Such  an approach would incorporate financial perform-  ance as part of the measure of CSP, by recogniz-  ing that financial/market performance implicitly  measures treatment of a key stakeholder, the  owner. Although, additional research is clearly  necessary to explore these specific relationships  between the stakeholder categories and financial  performance, the findings here are suggestive of  the need to alter current definitions of CSP to  bring them more closely into line with stakeholder  relations (cf. Wood and Jones, 1995; Waddock,  1996) as the weighted index does.  Implications for management  As strategic managers consider where to place  their investments, they may wish to take into  account the results reported above. This study  suggests that there is no detrimental impact or  penalty from allocating some resources towards  corporate social performance (as has also been  recognized in earlier research, e.g., Graves and  Waddock, 1994). In fact, it would seem that such  investments might be beneficial, especially if they  improve key stakeholder relations.  This research indicates that good CSP may go  beyond simple 'good deeds' in excess of normal  strategic activity to encompass a panoply of  stakeholder relations, simply because we have  used a broader measure of CSP than has tradition-  ally been used in the past and because our meas-  ure does both encompass and highly weight these  stakeholders' concerns. Typically single-dimen-  sion, narrow measures (for example, philanthropic  contributions, corporate volunteer records, build-  ing pollution control devices in excess of man-  date, or the building of day care centers) have  been used to assess CSP on the assumption that  CSP is discretionary activity above and beyond  required daily activities. Thus, prior CSP research  has been undertaken with an assumption that CSP  is an extra activity, an add-on to normal strategic  and management decision making, with reference  to the normal activities of corporate life (see  Carroll, 1979, 1995 for an articulation of this  type of framing of CSP). The present research  indicates that poor performance in primary stake-  holder domains, including environmental pollution  (measured by fines), poor labor relations, prob- This content downloaded from 152.15.47.133 on Thu, 23 Feb 2017 02:06:15 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms  316 S. A. Waddock and S. B. Graves  lematic products, and so on, may have significant  deleterious impacts on firm financial performance,  thus linking CSP-stakeholder relations more  tightly and simultaneously allowing more in-depth  exploration of the link to financial performance  than has been possible with more limited data  bases in the past.  Managers and scholars arguably need to  broaden their understanding of the term corporate  social performance to encompass the ongoing  nature of activities of a firm with respect to key  stakeholders. If good management theory and the  virtuous circle hold, as this research begins to  suggest, then CSP involves more than doing the  extras: it is a way of doing business. It may be  true that firms with available resources sometimes  go beyond minimum expectations of good man-  agement to achieve sound stakeholder relations  by investing in extras that are traditionally asso-  ciated with the slack-resources view of CSP.  Nonetheless, if strong performance is to continue,  strategic managers must focus increasingly on the  concerns of all stakeholders.
