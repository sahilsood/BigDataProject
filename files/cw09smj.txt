In particular, integrating and extending the resource-based view of the ﬁrm and stakeholder management literatures, we develop the arguments that good stakeholder relations not only enable a ﬁrm with superior ﬁnancial performance to sustain its competitive advantage for a longer period of time, but more importantly, also help poorly performing ﬁrms to recover from disadvantageous positions more quickly. The arguments are supported by the analysis of a series of ﬁrst-order autoregressive models. Our ﬁndings further suggest that the positive effect of good stakeholder relations on the persistence of superior performance is not as strong as that of some other ﬁrm resources, such as technological knowledge, but it is the only factor examined that promises to help a ﬁrm recover from inferior performance. Therefore, the role of positive stakeholder relations in helping poorly performing ﬁrms recover is found to be more critical than its role in helping superior ﬁrms sustain their performance advantage.

INTRODUCTION The literature on corporate social performance in general, and on stakeholder relations in particu- lar, has argued that a ﬁrm’s good relationships with its various stakeholders increase its ﬁnan- cial performance (Orlitzky, Schmidt, and Rynes, Keywords: stakeholder relations; corporate ﬁnancial per- formance; sustainability of ﬁnancial performance *Correspondence to: Heli Wang, Department of Management of Organizations, School of Business and Management, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong. E-mail: mnheli@ust.hk 2003; Roman, Hayibor, and Agle, 1999). Building upon the resource-based view (RBV) of the ﬁrm, some recent work regards a ﬁrm’s good relations with its stakeholders as valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable resources that contribute to the ﬁrm’s gaining and sustaining a performance advantage (Hillman and Keim, 2001; Ruf et al., 2001; Russo and Fouts, 1997). This suggests that good stakeholder relations not only help ﬁrms to gain performance advantages but also enable the performance advantages to persist. Many existing empirical studies in this area have focused on examining the cross-sectional Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 896 J. Choi, and H. Wang relationship between stakeholder relations and ﬁrm ﬁnancial performance and generally found that there is a positive association between the two (for reviews, see Orlitzky et al., 2003; Roman et al., 1999). But a ﬁnding that stakeholder rela- tions are positively associated with ﬁrm ﬁnancial performance does not necessarily suggest that they contribute to the persistence of that performance (Waring, 1996). To ﬁll the gap of the previous research, in this study we explicitly examine the effect of stakeholder relations on the persistence of a ﬁrm’s superior ﬁnancial performance. Moreover, the role of stakeholder relations in inﬂuencing the persistence of a ﬁrm’s inferior ﬁnancial performance is largely left unexplored. Some arguments in the RBV and dynamic capa- bilities literatures suggest that core resources that bring a ﬁrm competitive advantage may also be a source of ‘core rigidities’ when business condi- tions change (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Teece, Pisano, and Shuen, 1997). However, in this study we argue that while this logic generally applies to ﬁrms’ resources such as technological knowl- edge, it does not directly apply to relationship- based resources. More speciﬁcally, we posit that unlike other typical ﬁrm resources, good stake- holder relations can enhance a poorly perform- ing ﬁrm’s ﬂexibility in implementing strategic changes, and thereby help the ﬁrm move out of its disadvantageous position more quickly. HYPOTHESES This study focused on a ﬁrm’s relationships with several stakeholder groups ‘whose primary beneﬁt derived from the company is not from. . . share- holder returns’ (Coombs and Gilley, 2005: 827). In particular, the stakeholders in this study include employees, customers, suppliers, and the commu- nity at large. Stakeholder relations and the persistence of superior ﬁnancial performance A ﬁrm’s good relations with its various stakehold- ers can be a valuable resource that may lead to performance advantages for the ﬁrm (Hillman and Keim, 2001; Ruf et al., 2001; Russo and Fouts, 1997): employees will work harder to enhance the ﬁrm’s effectiveness (Dutton, Dukerich, and Har- quail, 1994); customers will increase their demand Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. or pay premium prices for the ﬁrm’s products (Brown and Dacin, 1997); suppliers will be more willing to engage in knowledge sharing with the ﬁrm (Dyer and Singh, 1998); and local commu- nities may provide favorable terms for the use of local infrastructure (Fombrun, 1996). Moreover, good stakeholder relations are likely to exist only in a relatively small number of ﬁrms; and, because each ﬁrm is idiosyncratic and has a unique history, there exist diverse stakeholder management practices, as well as differences in what each ﬁrm aims to achieve from stakeholder management. Not only are sound stakeholder rela- tions rare, but they are generally difﬁcult to imitate because different ﬁrms are likely to develop ﬁrm- speciﬁc stakeholder management practices that are tailored to their stakeholders and organizational objectives (Ruf et al., 2001). In addition, because the trust characterizing any sound stakeholder rela- tionship takes a long time to build (Barney and Hansen, 1994), it is unlikely that any rival ﬁrm can quickly construct stakeholder relationships as strong as those of the focal ﬁrm (Fombrun, 1996; Hillman and Keim, 2001). Thus the time dimen- sion, an important path-dependent attribute, makes good stakeholder relations difﬁcult for competing ﬁrms to imitate or substitute for, at least in the short run (Hillman and Keim, 2001). The complexity inherent in managing diverse stakeholders, which involves close interaction with a number of interrelated social actors, including employees, customers, suppliers, and communities, further impedes competitors from imitating or sub- stituting for a ﬁrm’s good stakeholder relations (Hillman and Keim, 2001). Indeed, some managers may simply not know how to build good relations with myriad stakeholders effectively. In addition, the complexity in ﬁrm-speciﬁc stakeholder rela- tionships makes it difﬁcult for managers to obtain useful advice from outside the ﬁrm on how to build strong stakeholder relations (Preece, Fleisher, and Toccacelli, 1995). Moreover, due to differences among ﬁrms in their cultural values, organizational structures, and other internal and external features, some ﬁrms may incur higher costs in building rela- tionship assets with their stakeholders than others. For example, Graves and Waddock (2000) have argued that building stakeholder relations is likely to derive directly from the values embedded in a company’s culture, implying that companies with core values that provide stakeholders with a sense of meaning and belonging are more likely to be Strat. Mgmt. J., 30: 895–907 (2009) DOI: 10.1002/smj able to build good stakeholder relations more efﬁ- ciently than ﬁrms without such values. So, com- peting ﬁrms without such core values may not be able to develop substitutes for a focal ﬁrm’s strong stakeholder relationships at a similar cost. In addition to a direct effect on a ﬁrm’s sus- tainable performance advantage, good stakeholder relations may also function as a complementary resource that protects against the dissipation of proﬁts generated from other core resources. For example, skilled employees are likely to be a source of superior performance; but, such a per- formance advantage may not be sustainable if the employees can be lured away to competing ﬁrms. However, since good relations with employees can create stronger loyalty and commitment, it reduces employees’ incentive to leave (McWilliams and Siegel, 2001). In sum, good stakeholder relations are valu- able, rare, and costly for rival ﬁrms to imitate and/or substitute for; moreover, they function as a complementary resource that helps sustain the performance advantage generated from other ﬁrm resources. We therefore propose: Hypothesis 1: Stakeholder relations are posi- tively associated with the persistence of superior ﬁnancial performance. Stakeholder relations and the persistence of inferior ﬁnancial performance The dynamic capabilities approach in strategy research (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000; Teece et al., 1997) suggests that core resources or capa- bilities that bring a ﬁrm competitive advantage are often specialized to the ﬁrm’s particular operating context (Brush and Artz, 1999; Priem and Butler, 2001). This feature of ﬁrm resources contributes to the sustainability of ﬁrm performance advantage, but it may also be a source of ‘core rigidities’ or a ‘competence trap’ in the face of changing business conditions (Leonard-Barton, 1992; Teece et al., 1997). These resources or capabilities may thus prevent a ﬁrm from recovering from a disad- vantageous position. For example, although orga- nizational routine is difﬁcult to imitate and thus often contributes to sustained performance advan- tage, it can also create inertia that prevents the necessary change that a ﬁrm needs for successful Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Research Notes and Commentaries 897 recovery from inferior performance (Hannan and Freeman, 1984; Stuart and Podolny, 1996). If this logic applied equally to all kinds of resources, it might be reasonable to expect that the good stakeholder relations that help sustain superior performance might also be a source of persistent inferior proﬁtability when the ﬁrm expe- riences ﬁnancial difﬁculties. However, we argue that unlike other typical ﬁrm resources or capa- bilities that only create value in a ﬁrm’s speciﬁc, existing operational setting, good stakeholder rela- tions built on trust and loyalty are generally not so specialized. As a result, a ﬁrm’s need to make strategic adjustments in order to recover from poor performance is unlikely to reduce the beneﬁts of maintaining good relations with its stakeholders. Rather, already established good stakeholder rela- tions will remain valuable because they encour- age stakeholders to maintain their commitment and support (Godfrey, 2005), which may in turn enable the ﬁrm to implement strategic changes. As such, good stakeholder relations that have already been built before a ﬁrm experiences poor performance may help the ﬁrm recover more quickly from its performance disadvantage. More speciﬁcally, inferior ﬁnancial performance is often a strong signal of the failure of exist- ing strategy. To recover, a poorly performing ﬁrm needs to adjust its business-level strategies by, for example, improving its operational processes, redesigning its products, or innovating in its exist- ing lines of business (Arogyaswamy, Baker, and Yasai-Ardekani, 1995). For this purpose, already established good relations with internal stakehold- ers may facilitate combining knowledge and capa- bilities that are scattered within the ﬁrm; good rela- tions with external stakeholders may allow the ﬁrm to access diverse external knowledge and informa- tion. Thus, stakeholders’ cooperation, facilitated by good ﬁrm-stakeholder relations, can contribute to the integration of internal and external resources needed for such strategic adjustments in order to recover from poor performance (Blomqvist and Sepp¨anen, 2003; Hillman and Keim, 2001). Good stakeholder relations may also be crucial when the ﬁrm needs to move out of poor per- formance by adjusting its corporate-level strategy, such as exploring new lines of business (Cohen and Prusak, 2001). For example, timely market infor- mation from suppliers, customers, and the commu- nity can offer valuable inputs about where and how a poorly performing ﬁrm should invest its limited Strat. Mgmt. J., 30: 895–907 (2009) DOI: 10.1002/smj 898 J. Choi, and H. Wang resources (Dyer and Singh, 1998). Furthermore, the community and the government can provide a well-connected ﬁrm with local infrastructure or licenses on favorable terms, which are often essential for exploring new business opportunities (McBeth, 1994). The Chrysler Corporation’s recovery during the recession of 1990 and 1991 owed much to the close relationships it had established with its diverse stakeholders, especially with its suppliers (Rigby, 2001). Chrysler’s suppliers suggested various ways to cut costs, which enabled Chrysler to substan- tially improve efﬁciency. As a result, Chrysler was able to use its ‘improved cash ﬂows to invest in new product development, introducing cross- functional platform teams to improve quality and speed’ (Rigby, 2001: 102). As another exam- ple, Malden Mills, a textile manufacturer in Mas- sachusetts, experienced a serious ﬁnancial crisis in 1995 as a result of an industrial accident (Ulmer, 2001). However, the company was able to recover from the crisis within less than one year. The main reason, according to CEO Aaron Feuerstein, was that its employees, suppliers, customers, and community stood behind the company and sup- ported it in various ways. Ulmer (2001) has docu- mented that the ﬁrm’s employees and many of its customers showed loyalty and strong support for the ﬁrm’s recovery efforts, the community raised donations for the ﬁrm, and the media publicized the company as an example of corporate responsi- bility. In summary, already established good stake- holder relations that are built on trust and loyalty can help a ﬁrm to more quickly move out of a dis- advantageous position by facilitating its strategic adjustments. Hypothesis 2: Stakeholder relations are nega- tively associated with the persistence of inferior ﬁnancial performance. METHODS Data and measures Data from KLD Research and Analytics Inc. was used to construct measures of stakeholder rela- tions. Information on stakeholder relations relating to ﬁrms belonging to the S&P 500, the DSI 400, or Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. both, was analyzed for the 11-year period of 1991 to 2001. It was then merged with COMPUSTAT data to obtain information on ﬁrm ﬁnancial per- formance and other control variables. After remov- ing ﬁrms with only one year stakeholder relations data during the sample period, we obtained a ﬁnal sample of 518 ﬁrms and 4,113 ﬁrm-year observa- tions. An aggregate measure of stakeholder relations was computed incorporating the community rela- tions, diversity, employee relations, environment, and product dimensions of the KLD data (Hill- man and Keim, 2001). Each of the ﬁve dimen- sions is tabulated in terms of several ‘strengths’ and ‘concerns’ in the KLD index. To arrive at a net score for each dimension, the total number of concerns was subtracted from the total number of strengths (Graves, Waddock, and Kelly, 2005). In addition, each dimension was standardized to make the scores across dimensions directly com- parable (Mattingly and Berman, 2006). The aver- age of standardized scores on the ﬁve dimensions with an equal weight was then used to obtain an aggregate stakeholder relations score (Hillman and Keim, 2001). Corporate ﬁnancial performance was measured in two ways: return on assets (ROA) and Tobin’s q. Following the lead of previous studies on the per- sistence of ﬁnancial performance (Waring, 1996; McGahan and Porter, 1999), each measure of ﬁnancial performance was adjusted by its indus- try average calculated at the four-digit Standard Industrial Classiﬁcation code level. Several variables that may affect the persistence of proﬁts were included as controls. First, techno- logical knowledge, estimated in terms of research and development (R&D) intensity, is often cited as one of the key sources of persistent perfor- mance advantage (Kogut and Zander, 1992). Sec- ond, ﬁrm risk, or the ratio of long-term debt to total assets, was also included, since risk has been found to be associated with both stakeholder relations and ﬁnancial performance (Waddock and Graves, 1997). Firm size, measured by the natural loga- rithm of total sales, was also added, because large size often brings economies of scale or scope, which may be difﬁcult to imitate (Roberts and Dowling, 2002). Furthermore, since inertia is gen- erally more signiﬁcant in older ﬁrms (Hannan and Freeman, 1984), ﬁrm age may show some effect on the persistence of performance differences, and Strat. Mgmt.

Industry dum- mies were also included to control for any variation across industries. studies previous (Geroski Modeling the persistence of ﬁrm proﬁtability Following and Jacquemin, 1988; McGahan and Porter, 1999; Waring, 1996), we examine the persistence of ﬁrm proﬁtability using a series of ﬁrst-order autoregres- sive models.1 The following equation, which is a variation of a typical ﬁrst-order autoregressive model, is estimated in this study. πit = α0 + α1 × SRi(t−1) + α2 × Xi(t−1) + β0 × πi(t−1) + β1 × SRi(t−1) × πi(t−1) + β2 × Xi(t−1) × πi(t−1) + I ndi(t−1) + εit (1) where β0 is the persistence rate when there is no inﬂuence from other factors (i.e., when β1 and β2 are 0). SRi(t−1) is the lagged value of stakeholder relations for ﬁrm i. Xi(t−1) represents other lagged factors that are expected to affect the persistence of ﬁrm proﬁts, including R&D intensity, ﬁrm risk, ﬁrm size, and ﬁrm age. I ndi(t−1) includes all industry dummy variables. Hypothesis 1 predicts positive estimates for β1 if the sample is composed of ﬁrms with superior proﬁtability, because a positive β1 indicates that the above-normal proﬁts earned by ﬁrms with good stakeholder relations have a greater persistence rate. In contrast, Hypothesis 2 predicts a negative β1 for a sample of ﬁrms with inferior proﬁtability, as a negative β1 indicates a lower proﬁt persistence rate, that is, ﬁrms with good stakeholder relations move out of inferior ﬁnancial performance more quickly. α1 indicates the independent contribution of stakeholder relations on proﬁtability. A ﬁrm ﬁxed-effects approach was taken to allow for any correlation of stakeholder relations with the ﬁrm-speciﬁc component of the error term. How- ever, some econometricians (e.g., Nerlove, 1967; Nickell, 1981) have established that the standard 1 In order to verify whether or not a simple ﬁrst-order autore- gressive (AR(1)) model properly represents proﬁt diffusion for this data, higher order models were tested up to order four. The ﬁrst-order autoregressive model consistently produced the lowest Akaike Information Criterion and Schwarz’s Bayesian Criterion values, conﬁrming it as preferable to higher-order models. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Research Notes and Commentaries 899 methods of ﬁrm ﬁxed-effects model estimation are liable to generate seriously biased coefﬁcients when estimating a ﬁrst-order autoregressive model like ours, due to the correlation of the lagged dependent variable with the error term. Nerlove (1967) and Nickell (1981) have also demonstrated that the biases are most serious when the panel has a large number of ﬁrms and a rather small num- ber of time periods, which is again the case for our sample (518 ﬁrms across 11 years). A formula developed by Nickell (1981), which has also been applied by McGahan and Porter (1999) and War- ing (1996) in their studies, was therefore applied to correct for any bias.2 if not Furthermore, stakeholder relations may be an endogenous variable inﬂuenced by a number of factors, which, taken into consideration, may lead to biased estimates (Greene, 1997). To address such concerns, we conducted a two-stage instrumental variable analysis (Greene, 1997). In this procedure, technological knowledge, slack resources, ﬁrm size, age, and risk were included in the ﬁrst-stage equation to predict stakeholder rela- tions, but all were lagged by one additional year. Studies in stakeholder management and social issues (e.g., Hillman and Keim, 2001; McWilliams and Siegel, 2000; Seifert, Morris, and Bartkus, 2004; Waddock and Graves, 1997) provide ratio- nales for including each of these factors. In addi- tion, an industry level of stakeholder relations was included as an instrumental variable. RESULTS The key analyses were conducted using two dif- ferent samples: an above average sample (i.e., superior ﬁnancial performance: N = 1, 618), and a below average sample (i.e., inferior ﬁnancial per- formance: N = 1, 510). The two subsamples were constructed based on whether the ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance (in terms of both ROA and Tobin’s q) was above or below the industry average.3 Some 2 This involved estimating a ﬁxed-effects model that differs from Equation (1) by subtracting each variable from the ﬁrm’s mean over the time period. After the persistence parameters of the ﬁxed-effects model were estimated, the amount of bias was then added back using Nickell’s (1981) formula to obtain unbiased estimates of the persistence parameters. 3 Since the ROA and Tobin’s q used in this study were industry- adjusted values, the above average group was composed of ﬁrms with both lagged ROA and lagged Tobin’s q greater than zero; Strat. Mgmt. J., 30: 895–907 (2009) DOI: 10.1002/smj 900 J. Choi, and H. Wang analyses were also conducted using a full sample (N = 4, 113), which serve primarily as a baseline for comparison. Table 1 presents descriptive statis- tics and correlations for the key variables in this study, using the full sample. Stakeholder relations and the persistence of ﬁnancial performance Table 2 presents the relationship found between stakeholder relations and the persistence of ﬁnan- cial performance. Hypothesis 1 states that good stakeholder relations can sustain a ﬁrm’s proﬁt advantage over a long period. Consistent with the prediction, the coefﬁcients on the interac- tion terms (stakeholder relations∗lagged ROA and stakeholder relations∗lagged Tobin’s q, Models 4a and 4b, Table 2) were signiﬁcantly positive, indi- cating that good stakeholder relations contribute to the persistence of superior ﬁnancial perfor- mance. Thus, Hypothesis 1 was supported. How- ever, stakeholder relations did not show a sig- niﬁcant effect on the intercept the coefﬁcient on the stakeholder relations term was insigniﬁcant), suggesting that although the supe- rior proﬁts of ﬁrms with high stakeholder rela- tions ratings dissipate more slowly, they eventually converge back to a proﬁt rate that is not signif- icantly different from the industry average (top chart, Figure 1).4 term (i.e., Hypothesis 2 predicts a negative sign on the interaction term (stakeholder relations∗lagged ﬁnancial performance) for ﬁrms with below- average performance. Models 6a and 6b of Table 2 show that the coefﬁcients on the stakeholder relations∗lagged ﬁnancial performance interaction terms were signiﬁcantly negative. This suggests that a high stakeholder relations rating predicts that a ﬁrm will be able to move out of a disadvantageous position more quickly. Thus, and the below average group comprised ﬁrms with both values less than or equal to zero. 4 The chart compares the path of proﬁt convergence of two hypothetical ﬁrms with superior proﬁtability, one with a high stakeholder relations score (one standard deviation above the mean), and the other with a low score in stakeholder relations (one standard deviation below the mean). Using the parameter estimates from Model 4a, the ﬁgure shows that a relative ROA of 0.13 in year zero erodes more slowly if the ﬁrm in question has a better stakeholder relations rating. Because stakeholder relations showed similar relationships with the persistence of both ROA and Tobin’s q, only the ROA relationship is charted. The chart depicting the effect on Tobin’s q is available from the authors upon request. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Hypothesis 2 was supported. Similar to the results with Models 4a and 4b, the stakeholder relations scores did not show a signiﬁcant effect on the intercept term, suggesting that below-normal proﬁts of ﬁrms with high stakeholder relations scores, in the long run, converge toward the industry average (bottom chart, Figure 1). (or The economic signiﬁcance of stakeholder rela- tions may be demonstrated by examining the inﬂu- ence of a one unit increase in the stakeholder relations measure on the persistence of ﬁnan- cial performance. According to Table 2, a one unit increase in the stakeholder relations mea- sure makes 90 percent of a ﬁrm’s superior ROA persist 27 percent from 3.35 years to 4.38 years: Model 4a), and in the case of Tobin’s q, 32 percent longer (or from 4.27 years to 5.62 years: Model 4b). Similarly, 90 percent of a ﬁrm’s inferior ROA will dissipate 55 percent faster (or in 0.75 years rather than 1.69 years: Model 6a) and in the case of Tobin’s q, 23 percent faster (or in 2.41 years instead of 3.15 years: Model 6b). longer Control variables and the persistence of ﬁnancial performance The positive and signiﬁcant coefﬁcients on both technological knowledge and its interactions with lagged ROA and Tobin’s q among well-performing ﬁrms indicate that investment in R&D predicts both better long-run proﬁts and the persistence of superior proﬁts. Among poorly performing ﬁrms, the coefﬁcients on the interaction terms between technological knowledge and lagged ﬁnancial per- formance remained signiﬁcantly positive, support- ing the argument that a high level of techno- logical knowledge locks a ﬁrm into disadvanta- geous positions. Technological knowledge, how- ever, contributes positively to the intercept term, suggesting a positive effect on long-run converged proﬁt levels. Also, ﬁrms with high debt ratios are less likely to sustain superior ROA. This result is consistent with expectations. Interestingly, large ﬁrms were found to be less likely to sustain a superior ROA, but more likely to sustain a superior Tobin’s q. This result seems to suggest that although large ﬁrms delivering superior performance are more likely to have ﬂuctuating accounting returns, they tend to receive stable evaluations from stock mar- ket investors.

Stakeholder relations and the persistence of ﬁnancial performance (Tobin’s q), but to a lesser extent than technolog- ical knowledge and ﬁrm size. Firm age also had a positive effect on the persistence of inferior perfor- mance for both performance measures, consistent with the argument that inertia is stronger in older ﬁrms. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS This study found support for the arguments that a high stakeholder relations rating both helps a well-performing ﬁrm to sustain superior proﬁts, and helps a poorly performing ﬁrm to move out of its disadvantageous position more quickly. In particular, this study has placed a special empha- sis on poorly performing ﬁrms and demonstrated that, unlike many other rare and hard-to-imitate resources, good stakeholder relations do not lock a ﬁrm into poor positions when it incurs a down- turn in ﬁnancial performance; instead, they help the ﬁrm recover more quickly from poor perfor- mance. As such, our study has emphasized the Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Research Notes and Commentaries 903 important role of a ﬁrm’s relations with key stake- holders in creating and sustaining economic rents for the ﬁrm. Stakeholder relations and technological knowl- edge assets demonstrated both similarities and dif- ferences in terms of their inﬂuence on the persis- tence of superior or inferior proﬁts. Although both a high stakeholder relations rating and a greater level of technological knowledge predict the per- sistence of superior proﬁts, the predictive power of technological knowledge is apparently greater (top chart in Figure 2). On the other hand, these two factors show opposite effects on the persis- tence of inferior proﬁts, as seen in the bottom chart in Figure 2. While technological knowledge tends to lock a poorly performing ﬁrm into disadvanta- geous positions, good stakeholder relations make inferior proﬁts more transient. This notable dis- crepancy implies that the common argument that resources that are sources of sustained superior proﬁts are also likely to be the sources of ongo- ing losses (Leonard-Barton, 1992) may not apply to stakeholder relations. These ﬁndings also suggest that the role of good stakeholder relations in helping poorly perform- ing ﬁrms recover is more critical than its role in helping superior ﬁrms sustain their performance. In particular, while good stakeholder relations help successful ﬁrms sustain their superior proﬁts, the degree of inﬂuence is not as high as that of some other ﬁrm resources, such as technological knowl- edge. On the other hand, having good stakeholder relations is the only factor (among those exam- ined in this study) that promises to help a ﬁrm recover from inferior performance. This highlights the importance of good stakeholder relations to poorly performing ﬁrms: a ﬁrm is unlikely to recover quickly from inferior performance without good stakeholder relations. Please note that this result does not suggest that a ﬁrm should build its stakeholder relations after it incurs poor per- formance. In fact, that would probably be too late due to the difﬁculty in building good relations in a short period of time, as well as the resource con- straints typical of poorly performing ﬁrms. Rather, our arguments and empirical results suggest that a poorly performing ﬁrm only beneﬁts from good stakeholder relations already built before the per- formance downturn. Some promising directions for future research may include a further exploration of the role of each stakeholder group on a conceptual level. Strat. Mgmt.

Comparing the effects of stakeholder relations and technological knowledge (R&D) This study has investigated the inﬂuence of each stakeholder group on the persistence of ﬁnancial performance empirically (see the Appendix), but more theoretical development that focuses on the contribution of each group is necessary. Varia- tions may exist even within a same stakeholder group. For example, a ﬁrm’s relationship with dif- ferent types of employees, such as that with key knowledge employees versus that with low-level laborers, are expected to have different degrees of impact on the persistence of corporate ﬁnan- cial performance. Further research efforts along these lines can enrich stakeholder theory and pro- vide meaningful, practical guidelines for manag- ing stakeholder groups. In addition, in this study stakeholder relations were assessed with a measure in which strengths and weaknesses (concerns) in the KLD ratings were combined. However, some recent work (e.g., Mattingly and Berman, 2006) has suggested that the effects of strengths and weaknesses in stakeholder relations be separately investigated. Thus future research might explore Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. this further by examining the separate effects of strengths and weaknesses, both conceptually and empirically. In addition to its direct contribution to the stake- holder management and corporate social responsi- bility literature, this study also contributes to the RBV. While recent studies increasingly acknowl- edge the usefulness of applying the RBV to enhance the theoretical development in the area of corporate social performance and stakeholder theory (McWilliams, Siegel, and Wright, 2006), empirical studies in this area have primarily focused on the role of stakeholder relations in gain- ing superior ﬁnancial performance. This study thus complements the existing research by explicitly demonstrating the inﬂuence of stakeholder rela- tions on the persistence of corporate ﬁnancial per- formance. Moreover, the study’s special attention on inferior-performing ﬁrms ﬁlls a gap in the RBV literature, which has largely focused on the sus- tainability of superior performance or competitive advantage. An additional contribution to the RBV is that we have explicitly distinguished between resources specialized to a ﬁrm’s operational con- text and relational resources that are noncontext- speciﬁc in terms of their inﬂuence on a ﬁrm’s recovery from inferior performance.

Wang APPENDIX: INDIVIDUAL DIMENSIONS OF STAKEHOLDER RELATIONS AND THE PERSISTENCE OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Each of the ﬁve dimensions of stakeholder rela- tions was examined separately to obtain a more in-depth understanding of its contribution to the persistence of corporate ﬁnancial performance. Table A1 presents the results of these additional analyses. For the superior-performing ﬁrms, both the employee relations and product dimensions have positive effects on the persistence of superior ROA and Tobin’s q. In addition, good manage- ment of diversity enables ﬁrms to sustain supe- rior ROA, and positive relations with the com- munity contributed to the persistence of supe- rior Tobin’s q. For the inferior ﬁnancial perfor- mance sample (Models 6–10 in Table A1), both the employee relations and diversity dimensions help ﬁrms to recover from disadvantaged positions more quickly. It was also found that high ratings in the product dimension enable a ﬁrm to recover from low Tobin’s q more quickly. Lastly, high scores in the community relations and environment dimensions make inferior ROA less persistent. Taken together, employee relations and product quality were found to be the most critical in mak- ing superior performance more persistent; respect for diversity and product quality are particularly helpful in overcoming inferior ﬁnancial perfor- mance more quickly. This suggests that it might be necessary for ﬁrms to strategically prioritize their attention to different stakeholder groups in order to beneﬁt the most from their stakeholder man- agement practices. The results suggest that man- agement of human resources (employee relations and diversity) and marketing (product) should be at the top of a manager’s agenda, ahead of commu- nity and environmental issues. Such prioritization should be especially important for ﬁrms that are especially constrained in the amount of resources they can dedicate to nonﬁnancial stakeholders.
