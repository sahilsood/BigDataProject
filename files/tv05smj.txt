This study examines corporate performance effects of cross-business knowledge synergies in multibusiness ﬁrms. It synthesizes the resource-based view of diversiﬁcation and the economic theory of complementarities to conceptualize cross-business knowledge synergies in terms of the relatedness and the complementarity of knowledge resources across business units of the multibusiness ﬁrm. The study hypothesizes that corporate performance is improved when the ﬁrm simultaneously exploits a complementary set of related knowledge resources across its business units. In a sample of 303 multibusiness ﬁrms, the study ﬁnds that synergies arising from product knowledge relatedness, customer knowledge relatedness, or managerial knowledge relatedness do not improve corporate performance on their own. Synergies arising from the complementarity of the three types of knowledge relatedness signiﬁcantly improve both market- based and accounting-based performance of the multibusiness corporation. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. The concept of cross-business synergy is central to the performance of multibusiness ﬁrms with diverse business portfolios (Goold and Luchs, 1993). Despite some inconsistent ﬁndings, the overall conclusion of nearly four decades of diversiﬁcation research is that ﬁrms whose businesses are resource related achieve superior value whereas ﬁrms whose businesses do not share any resources—except maybe ﬁnancial ones—destroy value (Rumelt, 1974; Hoskisson and Hitt, 1990; Palich, Cardinal, and Miller, 2000; Ramanujam and Varadarajan, 1989). Resource relatedness among business units is assumed to be a source of cross-business synergy that improves Keywords: corporate diversiﬁcation strategy; knowledge synergy; relatedness; complementarity; survey methodol- ogy; structural equation modeling; second-order construct *Correspondence to: H¨useyin Tanriverdi, MSIS Department, CBA 5.202 B6500, Red McCombs School of Business, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712-0212, U.S.A.

Despite the centrality of the concept of ‘synergy’ in diversiﬁcation research, existing relatedness constructs and measures intended to capture the underlying resource-based synergies of multibusiness ﬁrms are subject to several theoretical and methodological weaknesses. Theoretically, existing relatedness constructs focus on cross-business synergies arising from the relatedness of certain functional resources: e.g., product relatedness (Rumelt, 1974), manu- facturing relatedness (John and Harrison, 1999), technological relatedness (Robins and Wiersema, 1995; Silverman, 1999), R&D relatedness (Chat- terjee and Wernerfelt, 1991), marketing relatedness (Capron and Hulland, 1999), advertising related- ness (Chatterjee and Wernerfelt, 1991), managerial relatedness (Ilinitch and Zeithaml, 1995; Prahalad and Bettis, 1986), and human resource relatedness Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Received 16 September 2003 Final revision received 10 June 2004 98 H. Tanriverdi and N. Venkatraman (Farjoun, 1994). The manifestations of resource relatedness in multiple functional domains indicate that ﬁrms may be seeking to exploit cross-business synergies in multiple functional resources simulta- neously. Treating individual dimensions of cross- business synergies as independent and assessing their performance effects separately may lead to inconsistent results and preclude conclusions about the performance effects of cross-business syner- gies. Further, studies focusing solely on resource relatedness do not recognize that synergies can also arise from different, but complementary resources (Milgrom and Roberts, 1990, 1995; Harrison et al., 2001), and that such complementarities are the basis for distinctive corporate strategy (Porter, 1996). Methodologically, there is limited correspon- dence between resource-based theory and most operational measures of resource relatedness (Far- joun, 1994; Markides and Williamson, 1994; Robins and Wiersema, 1995). Direct measurement of the relatedness of a ﬁrm’s strategic resources is difﬁcult at the ﬁrm level. Hence, researchers resort to indirect measurements and approxima- tions that rely on the resource similarities of industries and the industry participation proﬁles of ﬁrms. The indirect measures have been crit- icized for diverging from the direct measures of resource relatedness (Nayyar, 1992), exagger- ating ﬁrms’ resource relatedness (Markides and Williamson, 1994) and capturing relatedness of tangible resources rather than the relatedness of more valuable intangible resources such as knowl- edge (Davis and Duhaime, 1992). In recent years, researchers have substantially improved indirect measurement of a ﬁrm’s knowledge relatedness by using measures of interindustry technology ﬂows (Robins and Wiersema, 1995) and occupa- tional proﬁles (Farjoun, 1994). Measuring knowl- edge relatedness more directly at the ﬁrm level may further increase the correspondence between resource-based views of related diversiﬁcation and operational measures of relatedness. Such a cor- respondence would also increase the validity of results and consequent implications for manage- ment. Further, most studies focus on the measure- ment of a ﬁrm’s relatedness strategy (Hill, Hitt, and Hoskisson, 1992), which captures potential relatedness—that is, whether a ﬁrm is positioned across business segments that have a potential to share common resources with each other. Yet the relatedness hypothesis is about the performance effects of actual, not potential, relatedness (Nayyar, 1992). Although many studies assume that poten- tial relatedness will automatically translate into actual relatedness and lead to the expected per- formance improvements, in practice implementa- tion difﬁculties prevent many ﬁrms from realizing the potential synergies among their business seg- ments (Nayyar, 1992). When studies use potential relatedness as a proxy for actual relatedness, inter- preting their results is difﬁcult: if business units do not share resources and, as a result, the ﬁrm performs poorly, is the poor performance due to the unrelatedness of the businesses or the ﬁrm’s inability to share the related resources? Finally, existing relatedness measures have been developed and tested almost exclusively in the manufacturing sectors. Hence, their applicability to service sectors has been questioned (Gassen- heimer and Keep, 1998; Nayyar, 1992). For exam- ple, technological relatedness was operationalized using patent data in manufacturing sectors (Robins and Wiersema, 1995; Silverman, 1999) but the patent mechanism is rarely used in service sec- tors. Further, patenting is not relevant for protect- ing some strategic knowledge resources of service ﬁrms such as customer knowledge. Although the human resource relatedness measure developed by Farjoun (1994) is potentially applicable in service sectors too, Farjoun (1994) applied it only in the manufacturing sectors. Given the signiﬁcance of service sectors, and the presence of both service and manufacturing businesses in business portfo- lios of many diversiﬁed ﬁrms, it is important to develop measures that capture knowledge related- ness of both service and manufacturing businesses. This study develops and validates a new con- ceptualization and measurement of cross-business knowledge synergies that address some of the weaknesses identiﬁed above. Theoretically, it syn- thesizes the resource-based views (RBV) of diver- siﬁcation and the economic theory of comple- mentarities to conceptualize cross-business knowl- edge synergies of a multibusiness ﬁrm in terms of the relatedness and complementarity of knowledge resources used by the business units of the ﬁrm. It construes cross-business knowledge synergy as a second-order construct. The ﬁrst level of the construct captures cross-business synergies aris- ing from the relatedness of knowledge resources. In particular, it focuses on product knowledge relatedness, customer knowledge relatedness, and Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 97–119 (2005) Knowledge Relatedness and the Performance of Multibusiness Firms 99 managerial knowledge relatedness. The second level of the construct captures additional synergies arising from the complementarity of the three types of knowledge relatedness. The study explains why the synergies arising from the three types of knowl- edge relatedness are necessary but not sufﬁcient and why their coexistence and complementarity are also required to increase corporate performance of multibusiness ﬁrms. Methodologically, this study increases the corre- spondence between RBV-based conceptualization of relatedness and operational measures of related- ness by measuring knowledge relatedness directly at the ﬁrm level. It avoids the confounding between relatedness strategy and implementation capabil- ity of the ﬁrm by developing a new measure- ment scheme that captures actual relatedness rather than potential relatedness of a ﬁrm’s businesses. It ensures that the new measurement instruments are applicable in both service and manufacturing sec- tors by validating them with a sample of service and manufacturing ﬁrms. With these theoretical and methodological advances, the study ﬁnds that cross-business knowledge synergies predict objec- tive measures of accounting-based (ROA, ROE) and market-based ﬁrm performance (Tobin’s q) after controlling for three established measures of relatedness, and other ﬁrm- and industry-level fac- tors. The paper is organized as follows. We start with a discussion of the concept of synergy and sources of synergy and integrate the resource-based view (RBV) of diversiﬁcation and the economic theory of complementarities to propose ‘resource related- ness’ and ‘resource complementarity’ as distinctive sources of cross-business synergy in multibusiness ﬁrms. We review the diversiﬁcation literature and identify product, customer, and managerial knowl- edge as the most strategic knowledge resources of the ﬁrm. We then argue that related prod- uct knowledge, related customer knowledge, and related managerial knowledge can create distinct synergies. Next, we explain that complementari- ties among the three types of knowledge related- ness could create additional synergies. We discuss performance effects of the synergies arising from the relatedness of knowledge resources and the complementarity of different types of knowledge relatedness. We then present an empirical study designed to validate the knowledge synergy con- struct and test its proposed effects on corporate performance. We conclude by discussing ﬁndings, their implications for research and practice, limita- tions, and potential avenues for future extensions. THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS A key proposition of the strategic management literature is that the overall value of a multibusi- ness ﬁrm exceeds the sum of individual values of its businesses when there are synergies among the businesses (Goold and Luchs, 1993). Super- additive value synergies between businesses (a) and (b) make their joint value greater than the sum of their standalone values: i.e., Value (a, b) > Value (a) + Value (b) (Davis and Thomas, 1993). The term ‘synergy’ has also been used synonymously with the term ‘economies of scope,’ and conceptu- alized in terms of the sub-additivity of production costs. When businesses (a) and (b) share some common factors of production, they achieve ‘syn- ergies’ or ‘economies of scope’ because their joint production costs are less than the sum of their stand-alone production costs: i.e., Cost (a, b) < Cost (a) + Cost (b) (Teece, 1982).1 These conceptualizations are problematic for examining the direct link between synergy and ﬁrm performance because they deﬁne synergy in terms of outcomes: i.e., if there is synergy, it must be observed in outcomes in the form of super-additive value or sub-additive costs. When both synergy and performance are deﬁned in outcome terms, the relationship between synergy and ﬁrm per- formance becomes tautological. One approach to avoid the tautology problem is to focus on sources of synergy rather than synergy per se (Davis and Thomas, 1993). Sources of synergy in multibusiness ﬁrms The most widely studied source of synergy in multibusiness ﬁrms is the ‘resource relatedness’ of businesses. Resource relatedness to the ‘presence of similar activities and shared resources’ across business units of the ﬁrm (Davis and Thomas, 1993). Researchers building on the resource-based view (RBV) of diversiﬁcation posit the sharing of strategic resources among that refers 1 Economies of scope are not to be confused with economies of scale, which refer to cost savings due to volume of production within a particular business.

Venkatraman business units creates cross-business ‘resource- based synergies,’ which in turn improve the overall value of the corporation (Farjoun, 1994; Markides and Williamson, 1994; Robins and Wiersema, 1995). They examine the link between resource relatedness and ﬁrm performance to understand if the synergies arising from the relatedness of resources make any difference in ﬁrm value. This approach eliminates the tautology problem. Resource sharing indicates that the business units are using common factors of production and achieving economies of scope: i.e., their joint pro- duction costs are less than the sum of their stand- alone production costs. Hence, the main type of synergy captured by ‘resource relatedness’ is sub- additivity in production costs. The value of a multi- business ﬁrm is a function of both sub-additive costs and super-additive values of the underlying resource combinations. The ‘resource relatedness’ construct does not adequately capture the super- additive value of the resource combinations. The economic theory of complementarities informs us about the super-additive value of resource combinations. It deﬁnes a set of resources as complementary when doing more of any one of them increases the returns to doing more (Milgrom and Roberts, 1995). of the others Complementary resources are not identical, but they are interdependent and mutually supportive. The returns obtained from the joint adoption of complementary resources are greater than the sum of returns obtained from the adoption of individual resources in isolation (Milgrom and Roberts, 1995). Thus, the use of a complementary set of related resources across business units can create additional, super-additive value synergies that are not captured by resource relatedness. The notion that resource complementarity is an important synergy in business combinations has been recognized in literature streams on acquisitions and alliances (Harrison et al., 2001). source of We synthesize the resource-based view (RBV) of diversiﬁcation and the economic theory of com- plementarities to argue that both the relatedness and the complementarity of resources can confer synergies. We conceptualize cross-business knowl- edge synergy of a multibusiness in terms of: (1) synergies arising from the relatedness of knowl- edge resources across business units; and (2) syn- ergies arising from the use of a complementary set of related knowledge resources across the business units. Synergies arising from knowledge relatedness We deﬁne knowledge relatedness as ‘the extent to which a multibusiness ﬁrm uses common knowl- edge resources across its business units.’ This con- struct is theoretically grounded in the resource- based view (RBV) of diversiﬁcation (Farjoun, 1994; Markides and Williamson, 1994; Robins and Wiersema, 1995): resource relatedness, that is, the use of common resources across business units, creates synergies or economies of scope in the form of sub-additive costs across the ﬁrm. it Knowledge relatedness of a ﬁrm can theoreti- cally be construed in many different dimensions because ﬁrms possess different types of knowl- edge resources (Schulz, 2001). However, is costly to create and exploit common knowledge resources across multiple business units (Hill and Hoskisson, 1987; Nayyar, 1993a). Unless bene- ﬁts exceed costs, achieving knowledge relatedness may not lead to the expected performance pay- offs (Gupta and Govindarajan, 2000). Therefore, in specifying the dimensionality of knowledge relat- edness, we focus on knowledge resources whose relatedness across business units is likely to create signiﬁcant economies of scope and have a positive effect on corporate performance. Knowledge resources of a ﬁrm can be cate- gorized into tacit and explicit. Tacit knowledge resides in the minds of human resources (Far- joun, 1994). It is costly to articulate and commu- nicate. Explicit knowledge is embedded in product and process technologies (Rumelt, 1974), patents (Robins and Wiersema, 1995), organizational pro- cesses, routines, and rules (Nelson and Winter, 1982). It can be expressed and communicated. Creation of economies of scope from knowledge requires the ﬁrm to use the same knowledge resources across multiple businesses. In general, tacit knowledge is sticky and costly to transfer (Szulanski, 1996). While human resources can be rotated across business units to facilitate the reuse of tacit knowledge, only a limited number of business units can beneﬁt from the services of a human being at any given time. Hence, tacit knowledge has limited potential to create signif- icant economies of scope in a multibusiness ﬁrm. However, explicit knowledge, which is embedded in technologies and organizational processes, can Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 97–119 (2005) Knowledge Relatedness and the Performance of Multibusiness Firms 101 be used at many business units simultaneously and create signiﬁcant economies of scope. Hence, we focus on explicit knowledge. relatedness technological Existing relatedness constructs deﬁne three major knowledge domains in which ﬁrms seek to exploit synergies. The constructs of product relatedness (St John and Harrison, 1999; Rumelt, 1974), (Robins and Wiersema, 1995), and R&D relatedness (Chatterjee and Wernerfelt, 1991) indicate that knowledge embedded in products is an important source of synergy. The constructs of market relatedness (Capron and Hulland, 1999) and advertising relatedness (Chatterjee and Wernerfelt, 1991) indicate that the knowledge of customers served in different markets is another important source of synergy. The constructs of dominant managerial logic and managerial relatedness (Ilinitch and Zeithaml, 1995; Prahalad and Bettis, 1986) indicate that ﬁrms can also exploit synergies in knowledge residing in managerial processes and logic. Other constructs, such as human resource relat- edness (Farjoun, 1994), span two or more of these knowledge domains. For example, since human resources may carry knowledge of products, cus- tomers, and managerial processes and logic simul- taneously, the human resource relatedness con- struct captures the relatedness of more than one type of knowledge. To better understand the indi- vidual and collective performance effects of the different types of knowledge relatedness, we make conceptual and methodological distinctions among the product, customer, and managerial knowledge resources, and specify product knowledge related- ness, customer knowledge relatedness, and man- agerial knowledge relatedness as the most impor- tant sources of cross-business knowledge synergy in multibusiness ﬁrms. Product knowledge relatedness as a source of synergy Knowledge is potentially applicable across multi- ple product markets. But there are few efﬁcient external markets for the exchange of knowledge (Teece, 1980). Thus, the internal market of a multi- business ﬁrm provides opportunities for exploit- ing similar product knowledge across multiple businesses and creating cross-business synergies (Teece, 1980). Synergies can arise from prod- uct knowledge created inside the ﬁrm as well as product knowledge acquired from outside through alliances of the ﬁrm. Synergies arising from internally created prod- uct knowledge have been the traditional focus of diversiﬁcation research. Canon’s ability to exploit a core set of optical and microelectronic technolo- gies across multiple businesses is a classic example of this logic (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990). Internal product knowledge resides in product and man- ufacturing platforms (Meyer and Lehnerd, 1997; Robertson and Ulrich, 1998). A product platform is a set of designs, subsystems, interfaces, and components that enables the development of a family of derivative products. Likewise, a man- ufacturing process platform is a set of process technologies used in the production of a family of products (Meyer and Lehnerd, 1997). Some com- panies seek to achieve higher product knowledge synergies by developing modular product architec- tures, ﬂexible manufacturing practices, modules, and module libraries that can be exploited in mul- tiple businesses (Garud, Kumaraswamy, and Lang- lois, 2003). Externally acquired product knowledge can also be a source of synergy. In a multibusiness ﬁrm, business units form alliances with different sup- pliers, manufacturers, and R&D partners (Ireland, Hitt, and Vaidyanath, 2002). The product skills and knowledge that each business unit acquires from its own R&D and manufacturing alliances may also be applicable in other business units of the multi- business ﬁrm (Inkpen and Dinur, 1998). To the extent that the ﬁrm is able to use the product skills and knowledge acquired from alliance partners of a business unit in other business units as well, the ﬁrm enjoys product knowledge synergies. Synergies arising from the exploitation of com- mon product knowledge across multiple busi- nesses confer both efﬁciency and effectiveness beneﬁts. When the business units share prod- uct designs, subsystems, interfaces, components, and manufacturing processes, the ﬁrm can obtain ‘asset amortization beneﬁts’ from economies of scope (Markides and Williamson, 1994). Reuse of existing product knowledge reduces develop- ment, tooling, and manufacturing costs, speeds up new product development, and allows a ﬁrm to rapidly address new market opportunities (Meyer and Lehnerd, 1997). New businesses that do not exploit existing product knowledge of the ﬁrm suf- fer from high costs and low margins because new technologies and processes often require major Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 97–119 (2005) 102 H. Tanriverdi and N. Venkatraman investments in research, design, engineering, and manufacturing (Nobeoka and Cusumano, 1997). Product knowledge synergies also enhance the effectiveness of a ﬁrm. For instance, the effec- tiveness of 3M is largely attributed to its ability to use common product development and man- ufacturing process knowledge across its business units. Further, innovations of one business unit may spark ideas for other businesses and lead to ‘asset improvement’ beneﬁts across the ﬁrm (Markides and Williamson, 1994). Customer knowledge relatedness as a source of synergy Customer knowledge is also a source of cross- business synergy in multibusiness ﬁrms. Customer knowledge refers to the needs, preferences, and buying behaviors of customers—why they pur- chase speciﬁc products and services, which prod- uct/service attributes they value, what value they hope to get by using them, and what their busi- nesses are about (Markides and Williamson, 1996; Woodruff, 1997). Firms develop customer knowl- edge directly through their own interactions with customers (Von Hippel and Katz, 2002) or indi- rectly through the interactions of their marketing and distribution alliance partners (Glazer, 1991). Since customer knowledge develops over long periods of time through learning relationships with customers (Woodruff, 1997), it is costly to observe and imitate it. Exchanging knowledge about expressed and latent needs of each other’s customers can allow business units of a multibusiness ﬁrm to cross- sell their offerings to each other’s customers or to develop new products and services. If the customers exhibit similar needs, preferences, and behaviors across different business units of the ﬁrm, the ﬁrm can reduce its overall marketing and advertising costs by redeploying its general mar- keting expertise, brands, and sales force among those businesses (Capron and Hulland, 1999). Businesses with dissimilar customer needs and behaviors have minimal opportunity to exploit cross-business customer knowledge synergies. For example, in the banking industry, businesses serv- ing institutional, and individual customer segments have limited similarities. Hence, mixing them has a negative impact on performance (Ramaswamy, 1997). Managerial knowledge relatedness as a source of synergy Managerial knowledge by which business units are governed can also be a source of cross-business synergy (Prahalad and Bettis, 1986). Managerial knowledge consists of managerial insights, expe- riences, and best practices of a ﬁrm. Compared to stand-alone businesses, businesses under the gov- ernance of a multibusiness ﬁrm have a learning scale opportunity in the development and exploita- tion of managerial knowledge. Businesses face some common managerial challenges regardless of their products and markets. For example, almost all businesses face challenges in the management of risks, investments, and alliances. Fundamental principles of good management are applicable in many different contexts (Koontz, 1969). If some businesses of a multibusiness ﬁrm ﬁgure out how to effectively deal with some of those manage- rial challenges, their learning can also be useful to other businesses in the ﬁrm. To the extent that the multibusiness ﬁrm is able to exploit such learn- ing across multiple business units, it can achieve economies of scope in its managerial knowledge. The managerial knowledge of a multibusiness ﬁrm usually resides in its corporate-level managerial processes (Grant, 1988). We focus on three facets of managerial knowledge that are critical for a multibusiness ﬁrm: investment management, risk management, and alliance management. Investment management is critical for the overall value of a multibusiness ﬁrm (Rajan and Servaes, 2000). In the absence of common processes that embed the ﬁrm’s best practices and preferences in investment management, individual businesses tend to manage their investments independently. The lack of coordination can lead to redundancies, duplication of effort in investment management, and hence increased costs across the business units. It can also lead to underinvestment in product and process technologies or marketing and advertising initiatives that could beneﬁt the corporation as a whole (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990). Misallocation of investments negatively impacts the overall value of the ﬁrm (Berger and Ofek, 1995). Risk management is also critical for the overall value of a multibusiness ﬁrm (Bettis and Mahajan, 1985). A key objective of a multibusiness ﬁrm is to reduce overall risks of its businesses. By forming a portfolio of counter-cyclical businesses, a multi- business ﬁrm can smooth out ﬂuctuations in its Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 97–119 (2005) Knowledge Relatedness and the Performance of Multibusiness Firms 103 income and minimize negative impacts of exter- nal economic conditions. But the formation and maintenance of a counter-cyclical business port- folio require corporate-level coordination. In the absence of coordination, individual businesses may acquire new businesses that do not contribute to the risk minimization objectives of the corporation. By using common risk management principles and processes, the multibusiness ﬁrm can coordinate actions of its business units. For example, Hanson Trust PLC is known for its minimization of down- side risk. When considering potential acquisitions, a common managerial principle used by Hanson, regardless of the type of business, is to evaluate the size and likelihood of downside risk of the acqui- sition and its implications for the ﬁrm as a whole (Hill and Jones, 1998). Formation and management of alliances have also become important for multibusiness ﬁrms. To acquire complementary resources and capabil- ities, businesses enter into alliances with external partners (Inkpen, 2001). In a multibusiness ﬁrm, each business has numerous alliances with suppli- ers, manufacturers, distributors, and other business partners. They spend substantial time and effort in identifying alliance partners, determining goals of alliances, negotiating terms, making agreements, choosing appropriate governance structures, build- ing social and relational capital, and managing the alliances (Ireland et al., 2002; Inkpen, 2001). Although the speciﬁc contents of the alliances are different, managerial challenges entailed in the for- mation and management of the alliances are sim- ilar. To the extent that the multibusiness ﬁrm is able to encode its alliance management best prac- tices into some common processes, and exploit those processes across multiple business units, it can exploit economies of scope in its alliance man- agement knowledge. If the individual businesses manage their alliances independently, the ﬁrm for- goes such synergies. Synergies arising from knowledge complementarity We deﬁne knowledge complementarity as the ‘the extent to which a multibusiness ﬁrm uses a com- plementary set of common knowledge resources across its business units.’ This construct is derived from the economic theory of complementarities (Milgrom and Roberts, 1995): complementary resources create super-additive value synergies. In discussing knowledge relatedness, we iden- tiﬁed relatedness of product knowledge, relat- edness of customer knowledge, and relatedness of managerial knowledge as distinct sources of cross-business knowledge synergy in multibusi- ness ﬁrms. The three types of knowledge relat- edness are also complementary to each other. Hence, their coexistence can create additional, super-additive value synergies that are not captured by any one of them in isolation. Conversely, the absence or weakness of one of them can diminish the value of the others too. R&D knowledge (product knowledge) and marketing and distribution knowledge (customer knowledge) are complementary in business combi- nations (Harrison et al., 2001). The multibusiness ﬁrm has an opportunity to use similar product designs, subsystems, interfaces, and components when customers exhibit similar needs, preferences, and purchasing behaviors across products of its different businesses. Consider automobile, motor- cycle, and power equipment businesses of Honda. To the extent that customers have similar needs and preferences across cars, motorcycles, and lawn mowers (e.g., demand for high reliability, high durability, high fuel efﬁciency, and low emission levels), the three businesses have an opportunity to exploit similar technologies, processes, and mate- rials in developing reliable, durable, fuel-efﬁcient, and environmentally friendly cars, motorcycles, and lawn mowers. In addition to cross-selling the products to the same customers, they can enjoy product knowledge synergies. Firms whose busi- nesses exchange customer and product knowledge to serve multiple needs of customers are valued higher by the stock market than ﬁrms whose busi- nesses share factors of production, but not cus- tomer knowledge (Nayyar, 1993b). When product knowledge relatedness or cus- tomer knowledge relatedness is missing, due to the complementarity, the value of the other can also diminish. For example, Daimler Benz’s acqui- sition of Chrysler realized few synergies because the two ﬁrms served different markets (Harri- son et al., 2001). Differences in customer needs, preferences, and purchasing behaviors across the two businesses overwhelmed the potential product knowledge synergies that the two businesses could have achieved by sharing similar product designs, subsystems, interfaces, and components. Doing so would produce automobiles that do not meet cus- tomer needs. Thus, related product knowledge is Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 97–119 (2005) 104 H. Tanriverdi and N. Venkatraman a valuable source of cross-business synergy when it is complemented with related customer knowl- edge. Related managerial knowledge is also a com- to related product and related cus- plement tomer knowledge. Existing managerial knowledge enables or constrains a ﬁrm’s ability to operate in new businesses (Rumelt, 1974). In general, ﬁrms tend to enter into businesses where they can exploit their exiting managerial knowledge (Chang, 1996; Ilinitch and Zeithaml, 1995) and refrain from entering into businesses that do not match their managerial knowledge (Chang, 1996). Entering into a managerially unrelated business is difﬁcult and costly because the learning of new managerial skills and knowledge requires unlearn- ing of parts of organizational culture, dismantling of current power structures, and establishment of new managerial systems (Galbraith, 1983). For example, diversiﬁcation of some oil companies into other extractive energy and natural resource businesses was not successful despite the relat- edness of products and customer markets (Goold and Luchs, 1993). The lack of related managerial skills and knowledge might have overwhelmed the product and customer-based synergies that the oil ﬁrms had hoped to achieve in energy and natural resource businesses. The performance impact of cross-business knowledge synergies The distinctiveness and sustainability of a corpo- rate strategy depends not only on doing many indi- vidual activities well but also integrating among them (Porter, 1996). Hence, achieving knowledge relatedness within product, customer, and man- agerial knowledge domains is necessary but not sufﬁcient for a distinctive and sustainable strategy. There are two main reasons to expect that per- formance effects of the ﬁrm’s knowledge synergy strategy will be contingent on the synergies aris- ing from the complementarity of the three types of knowledge relatedness. First, a complementary bundle of resources pro- vides unique value to the ﬁrm (Harrison et al., 2001). Each dimension of knowledge relatedness captures a different sub-additive cost synergy: i.e., reduced costs in product development activities, reduced costs in marketing and advertising activi- ties, and reduced costs in governance of multiple business units. The overall cost-based synergies obtained from the three dimensions will be greater than the synergies obtained from any dimension alone. Further, the complementarities among the three dimensions of knowledge relatedness cre- ate super-additive value synergies. The sum of the cost-based and the value-based synergies will have a stronger effect on ﬁrm performance than the cost- based synergies alone. Second, a system of complementarities is difﬁ- cult to observe and imitate (Porter, 1996). Com- petitors may observe the similarities in product designs, subsystems, interfaces, and components across multiple business units of the ﬁrm. They may notice that the business units are exploit- ing similar marketing and advertising skills and knowledge. The managerial policies and processes by which the businesses are governed may also be obvious to the competitors. However, syner- gies arising from different, yet complementary resources are not as obvious to competitors as synergies arising from similar resources (Harrison et al., 2001). In our case, the complementarities among the related product, customer, and manage- rial knowledge resources are much more difﬁcult to observe and imitate. To start with, the com- petitors may lack the strategic foresight to recog- nize the complementarities (Milgrom and Roberts, 1995). Assuming that they recognize the comple- mentarities, competitors have to make systemic changes in product designs, subsystems, interfaces, and components; customer interactions and mar- keting and advertising activities; and managerial policies and processes of their business units. They are likely to face implementation challenges and incur substantial costs and time delays. If the prob- ability of successful imitation along one dimen- sion is 90 percent, it will drop down to 81 percent (0.9 ∗ 0.9) along two dimensions, and 73 percent (0.9 ∗ 0.9 ∗ 0.9) along three dimensions. Due to the complementarities, implementing a single dimen- sion without implanting the others will not produce the intended performance improvements (Porter, 1996). In fact, it may even produce negative per- formance effects (Milgrom and Roberts, 1995). Unless they successfully match the whole system of complementarities, competitors will get little beneﬁt from imitation (Porter, 1996). When there are strong complementarities among a set of resources, a multibusiness ﬁrm aiming to create cross-business synergies out of them has a marked need for actively coordinating the sharing of those resources across its business units.

Thus, we construe the overall cross- business knowledge synergy of a multibusiness ﬁrm as a latent second-order construct. The ﬁrst level of the construct captures sub-additive produc- tion cost synergies arising from knowledge relat- edness within product, customer, and managerial knowledge domains, whereas the second level cap- tures super-additive value synergies arising from the complementarity of the three types of knowl- edge relatedness. In assessing performance effects of a comple- mentary system, it is imperative to compare per- formance effects of individual system components with the performance effects of the full system to deﬁne the conditionality of individual effects on the effects of other system components and to ensure that the full system effects outweigh the individual component effects (Ichniowski, Shaw, and Prennushi, 1997; Whittington et al., 1999). To test whether performance effects of cross-business knowledge synergies are contingent on the com- plementarity of the three types of knowledge relat- edness or whether each type of knowledge relat- edness has an independent direct effect on ﬁrm performance, we specify two competing hypothe- ses: (1) a ‘strong-form’ hypothesis stating that the complementarity of the three types of knowledge relatedness will have a positive effect on corpo- rate ﬁnancial performance; and (2) a ‘weak-form’ hypothesis stating that each type of knowledge relatedness will have an independent direct effect on corporate performance. The weak-form hypoth- esis states that sub-additive production cost syner- gies arising from any type of knowledge related- ness can drive corporate performance but posits no signiﬁcant additional explanatory power for the super-additive value synergies arising from the complementarity of the three types of knowledge relatedness. Hypothesis 1 (strong form): Complementarity of product knowledge relatedness, customer knowl- edge relatedness, and managerial knowledge relatedness has a positive effect on corporate ﬁnancial performance of multibusiness ﬁrms. Hypothesis 2 (weak form): Product knowledge relatedness, customer knowledge relatedness, and managerial knowledge relatedness have independent positive direct effects on corporate ﬁnancial performance of multibusiness ﬁrms. METHODS Our sample was the multibusiness Fortune 1000 ﬁrms listed in the year 2000. We used a survey to collect primary data from senior executives to measure cross-business knowledge synergies of these ﬁrms in product, customer, and managerial domains. We also obtained secondary data from the COMPUSTAT and CRSP databases to compute objective measures of ﬁrm performance and some of our control variables. Dependent variables We adopted three widely used objective measures of ﬁrm performance in the diversiﬁcation litera- ture as our dependent variables to test the pre- dictive validity of the cross-business knowledge synergy constructs: return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and Tobin’s Q. We computed Tobin’s Q as the ratio of the market value of a ﬁrm to the replacement cost of its assets, using basic ﬁnancial and accounting data from COMPU- STAT (Chung and Pruitt, 1994). We introduced a 1-year lag between knowledge synergies and ﬁrm performance, measuring knowledge synergies in 2000 and ROA, ROE, and Tobin’s Q with year 2001 ﬁnancial data. This lagged structure allowed us to assess whether knowledge synergies in a given year affected ﬁrm performance in the subse- quent year. Cross-business knowledge synergies Cross-business knowledge synergy is modeled as a second-order factor model. First-order factors cap- ture sub-additive production cost synergies aris- ing from the relatedness of product knowledge, relatedness of customer knowledge, and related- ness of managerial knowledge. The second-order factor captures patterns of interactions and covari- ance among the ﬁrst-order factors to capture the super-additive value synergies arising from the complementarity of the three types of knowledge relatedness.

We We developed new measurement items and adapted existing measures to capture managers’ perspectives on their ﬁrms’ product knowledge relatedness, customer knowledge relatedness, and managerial also developed a new response scale that captures actual knowledge relatedness of ﬁrms as perceived by their managers. We asked our respondents whether a given knowledge resource was unique and speciﬁc to each business unit or common and applicable to multiple units (1 = unique in all or almost all of the business units, 2 = unique in a majority of the business units, 3 = unique in about half of the business units, common across the other half, 4 = common across a majority of the business units, and 5 = common across all or almost all of the business units). By emphasizing the degree to which the ﬁrm uses common knowledge resources rather than the potential applicability of knowledge resources across the businesses, we have designed our response scale to capture the actual, realized knowledge relatedness of a given business portfolio rather than potential relatedness. We pre-tested the survey instruments with 10 domain experts in academia and 25 executives of Fortune1000 ﬁrms in meetings each lasting about 45 minutes. This step allowed us to assess the face and content validity of items and ensure that executives understood the instructions, questions, and response scales of the instrument as they were intended. Due to the challenges entailed in achieving suf- ﬁcient response rates from multiple informants, we chose to use a single informant per ﬁrm in the data collection (Bagozzi and Phillips, 1982). We fol- lowed the suggestions of Huber and Power (1985) to minimize any potential measurement error that may result from the use of a single informant. To identify the most knowledgeable informants about corporate product, marketing, and managerial poli- cies of their ﬁrms, we conducted a content analysis on publicly available lists and biographies of the ofﬁcers of all Fortune 1000 ﬁrms. We selected corporate-level executives who had advanced to their current positions after gaining experience in the product, marketing, and strategic planning functions of their corporations. To motivate par- ticipation, we promised informants an invitation to a conference where the results of the study would be discussed with participants. To minimize the effects of elapsed time and recall problems, we asked informants general questions about the organization and management of their knowledge resources at the time of the survey. All questions were pre-tested and well structured. Informant competency measures indicated that our informants were highly knowledgeable about the questions asked for this study (Kumar, Stern, and Anderson, 1993). We customized the surveys and cover letters sent to individual ﬁrms and infor- mants. Four follow-up letters were mailed in the 2nd, 4th, 8th and 12th weeks after the initial survey mailing. Both the original and follow-up mailings informed recipients that a Web-based version of the survey was available for their convenience and provided them with unique passwords to the survey Web site. Response rate Thirty-two ﬁrms in the original sample merged with other ﬁrms, were acquired, or declared bankruptcy during data collection. The executives of 82 ﬁrms declined to participate owing to company policy. 303 multibusiness ﬁrms provided usable responses, a ﬁgure constituting a response rate of about 34 percent. Forty-eight percent of these ﬁrms operated in manufacturing industries, and 52 percent operated in service industries. There were no statistically signiﬁcant differences between responding and nonresponding ﬁrms for size (t =− 1.38, p > 0.10), Tobin’s Q (t = 0.42, p > 0.10), ROA (t = 0.22, p > 0.10), or total diversiﬁcation level (t = 0.94, p > 0.10). Early and late respondents did not differ on these measures either. Control variables We controlled for industry-level and ﬁrm-level fac- tors that may inﬂuence performance of a multi- business ﬁrm. In identifying ﬁrm-level factors, we paid attention to factors that may have a bearing on both a ﬁrm’s decision to exploit cross-business knowledge synergies and the performance of the ﬁrm because omitted variables that inﬂuence both independent and dependent variables can create the endogeneity problem and invalidate conclusions in diversiﬁcation research (Campa and Kedia, 2002).

We control for three established measures of business relatedness: the the entropy measure of related component of diversiﬁcation (Palepu, 1985); (2) human resource relatedness (Farjoun, 1994); and (3) technological relatedness (Robins and Wiersema, 1995). We computed DR using Palepu’s (1985) formulas. We measured human resource relatedness by asking informants whether the professional skills and knowledge used in developing the products and/or services of their corporations were unique and speciﬁc to each business unit or common and applicable across multiple business units. We measured technological relatedness similarly, asking the informants whether the patents used in their corporations were unique and speciﬁc to each business unit or common and applicable across multiple business units. We also used these relatedness measures to assess the nomological validity of relatedness constructs developed in this study. the new knowledge Firm size Large size may increase performance of multi- business ﬁrms by offering a higher potential for exploiting knowledge-based synergies or it may decrease ﬁrm performance by leading to costs arising from managerial diseconomies (Nayyar, 1993a). To control for ﬁrm size, we computed the logarithm of the total number of a ﬁrm’s employees. Risk level In considering opportunities for cross-business knowledge synergy exploitation, managers will prefer the least risky initiative among a set of initiatives that have equal expected returns. The omission of the risk level of the ﬁrm’s business portfolio can result in misleading interpretations of the performance of diversiﬁed ﬁrms (Bettis and Mahajan, 1985). Hence, we controlled for risk level. In models that used a market-based measure of ﬁrm performance (Tobin’s Q models), we con- trolled for ﬁrm betas that are derived from the Cap- ital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). In models that used accounting-based measures of ﬁrm perfor- mance (ROA or ROE models), we controlled for the corresponding downside risk measure (Miller and Leiblein, 1996). The downside risk of a ﬁrm in a given year was computed as its shortfalls in accounting performance relative to average indus- try performance over the previous 5 years.2 Past performance of the ﬁrm Poorly performing ﬁrms tend to diversify (Campa and Kedia, 2002). Not taking into account past performance may result in attributing performance effects to failure of the ﬁrm in exploiting cross- business knowledge synergies rather than to poor prior performance. Hence, we control for ﬁrm performance in the previous year. Industry performance To account for industry effects on ﬁrm perfor- mance, we respectively controlled for average industry Tobin’s Q, average industry ROA, and average industry ROE in models using Tobin’s Q, ROA, and ROE as measures of ﬁrm performance. Assessment of measurement and structural properties We used a conﬁrmatory factor analytic approach within LISREL 8.3 (Joreskog and Sorbom, 1996). To minimize the potential problem of interpreta- tional confounding, we established the validity of the measurement model prior to testing the struc- tural model (Byrne, 1998). Doing so minimizes misﬁt in the measurement model so that any misﬁt in the overall structural model can be attributed to structural relationships. Although we conceptualized cross-business knowledge synergies as a second-order construct, we also recognized plausible alternative speciﬁca- tions for the relationships between a high-level construct and its dimensions (Law, Wong, and Mobley, 1998). We speciﬁed various alternative measurement models at the ﬁrst-order and second- order levels and assessed their relative ﬁts. We validated the measurement properties in multiple stages. First, we used an item puriﬁcation pro- cess to identify a set of items that parsimoniously captured the variance in the data and eliminated unreliable items. Second, we assessed the mea- surement properties of the individual ﬁrst-order 2 Results were robust when risk was computed with standard deviation of ROA (or ROE) over a 5-year period.

Third, we assessed the relative ﬁts of alter- native ﬁrst-order measurement models. Finally, we assessed the presence of a second-order fac- tor accounting for the patterns of interactions and covariance among the ﬁrst-order factors. RESULTS Measurement model Internal consistency of measurements Table 1 provides the response scale, ﬁnal measure- ment items, and reliability measures of the ﬁrst- order factors. We conﬁrmed cross-business knowl- edge synergy to be a second-order construct that captures complementarities among related knowl- edge resources within product, customer, and managerial knowledge domains: (1) relatedness of internal product knowledge, (2) relatedness of external product knowledge acquired from R&D and manufacturing alliances of individual busi- nesses, (3) relatedness of customer knowledge, (4) relatedness of risk and investment management processes, and (5) relatedness of alliance manage- ment processes. As the last columns of Table 1 indicate, the coefﬁcient alpha values of all the ﬁrst- order factors are above the suggested threshold value of 0.70, providing evidence of the measures’ reliability (Nunnally, 1978). The composite mea- sure reliability (ρc) scores are also above the sug- gested threshold of 0.50, demonstrating the internal consistency of the measures. Dimensionality and convergent and discriminant validity Second, we tested the dimensionality and conver- gent and discriminant validity of the knowledge synergy construct by comparing four alternative measurement models. Model 1 has a unidimen- sional ﬁrst-order factor that accounts for the vari- ance among all 13 items. In Model 2, the 13 items Table 1.

Model 3 has the 13 items forming ﬁve cor- related ﬁrst-order factors. Finally, in Model 4 we posit a second-order factor that accounts for the relationships among the ﬁve ﬁrst-order factors. Comparison of Model 1 (χ 2 = 1366.93, d.f. = 65) and Model 2 (χ 2 = 633.14, d.f. = 65) shows that Model 2 is a better-ﬁtting model (has a lower chi-square for the same degrees of freedom), indi- cating that a multidimensional model comprising of ﬁve uncorrelated ﬁrst-order factors is superior to a unidimensional ﬁrst-order factor model. Hence, we obtained support for the multidimensionality of the ﬁrst-order knowledge relatedness constructs. Further comparison of two nested models, Model 2 and Model 3, indicated that the unconstrained Model 3 (χ 2 = 257.78, d.f. = 55), with its ﬁve freely correlated ﬁrst-order factors, is superior to the constrained Model 2, with its ﬁve uncorre- lated ﬁrst-order factors ( χ 2 = 375.36,  d.f. = the standardized 10, p < 0.0001). In Model 3, ‘loadings’ of items on their the measurement respective factors are all highly signiﬁcant (p < 0.001), providing support for convergent validity. The superiority of Model 3 (unconstrained) over Model 2 (constrained) indicates that pairs of correlations among the ﬁrst-order factors are signiﬁcantly different from zero. They are also below the cut-off value of 0.90 (Bagozzi, Yi, and Phillips, 1991), demonstrating the distinctive- ness of the theoretical content captured by the individual ﬁrst-order factors. The measurement items’ convergence on their respective factors and the factors’ distinctness from each other support our construct’s discriminant validity (Bagozzi and Phillips, 1982). First-order vs. second-order factor models Finally, we tested whether a second-order factor explained complementarities among the ﬁve ﬁrst- order factors by accounting for their patterns of interactions and covariance. To test for the pres- ence of second-order factor models, Marsh and Hocevar (1985) developed the target coefﬁcient (T ) statistic, which is the ratio of the chi-square value of the ﬁrst-order factor model to the chi- square value of the second-order factor model. The target coefﬁcient has an upper limit of 1.0. Therefore, support for the existence of a second- order factor becomes stronger as T approaches unity (Marsh and Hocevar, 1985). A complemen- tary set of statistics is given by the signiﬁcance of the parameters reﬂecting the second-order fac- tor loadings (Venkatraman, 1990). For the second- order knowledge synergy construct, the target coef- ﬁcient value is 0.83, indicating that a second- order factor accounts for 83 percent of the relations among the ﬁrst-order factors. More importantly, all second-order factor loadings (γ [1, 1]) − γ [5, 1]) are highly signiﬁcant (p < 0.001), providing fur- ther justiﬁcation for the acceptance of the second- order factor model. Collectively, these results support the multidi- mensionality, convergent and discriminant valid- ity, and reliability of a second-order knowledge synergy construct. Descriptive statistics and correlations Descriptive statistics and correlations among the constructs of the study are summarized in Table 2. Knowledge synergies have positive and signiﬁcant associations with Tobin’s Q, ROA, and ROE. An examination of the nomological relation- ships among knowledge synergy, human resource relatedness (HRR), and technological relatedness (TR) reveals that knowledge synergy has highly signiﬁcant associations with HRR (r = 0.63, p < 0.0001) and TR (r = 0.67, p < 0.0001). How- ever, comparison of alternative measurement mod- els respectively modeling HRR and TR (1) as part of the knowledge synergy construct (χ2 = 476.24, d.f. = 85) and (2) as independent con- structs (χ 2 = 743.53, d.f. = 87) reveal that knowl- edge synergy, HRR, and TR are independent con- structs ( χ 2 = 267.29,  d.f. = 2, p < 0.0001). Collectively, these ﬁndings provide evidence for nomological validity of the knowledge synergy construct. As for the related component of the entropy measure of diversiﬁcation (DR) (Palepu, 1985), the correlation between knowledge synergy and DR is signiﬁcant but negative (r =− 0.21, p < 0.001). It is interesting to note that DR also has signiﬁcant and negative correlations with HRR (r =− 0.16, p < 0.01) and TR (r =− 0.20, p < 0.001). These ﬁndings are consistent with the argu- ments that indirect measurements of relatedness with industry-level data, such as DR, diverge from direct measurement of relatedness with ﬁrm-level Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Test of hypotheses Due to the intractability of higher-order interac- tions, researchers theorizing about the complemen- tarity of three or more variables resort to the use of pair-wise interaction tests to test their complemen- tarity hypotheses. They include main variables and their pair-wise interactions in a regression equation and test for the signiﬁcance of the pair-wise inter- action terms as evidence of complementarity. It was not appropriate to use the pair-wise interaction test approach in this study for three reasons. First, there are highly signiﬁcant correlations between product knowledge relatedness and cus- (r = 0.38, p < tomer knowledge relatedness 0.001); product knowledge relatedness and man- agerial knowledge relatedness (r = 0.39, p < 0.001); and customer knowledge relatedness and managerial knowledge relatedness (r = 0.25, p < 0.001). Further, the multiplicative pair-wise inter- actions of these variables are also highly corre- lated with each other and with the variables from which they are computed (correlations range from r = 0.41 to r = 0.85, all signiﬁcant at p < 0.001 level). When the main variables and their pair- wise interactions are so highly correlated with each other, coefﬁcient estimates obtained from the regression equation do not reﬂect inherent effects of any particular independent variable on the dependent variable but only marginal or par- tial effects, given the other, correlated independent variables in the model. While the high level of intercorrelations is a problem for using the pair- wise interaction test, it is consistent with the theory of complementarities, which predicts high levels of interaction and covariance among the compo- nents of a system of complements (Milgrom and Roberts, 1990, 1995). Second, the pair-wise interaction test assumes that the complementarities exist at the level of pairs of variables. Our theory is about the performance effects of multilateral interactions among product knowledge relatedness, customer knowledge relat- edness, and managerial knowledge relatedness. But the pair-wise interaction test is not capable of detecting multilateral interactions and covariance implied by the theory of complementarities (Whit- tington et al., 1999). Third, the pair-wise interaction test is also used to test for other theoretical relationships such as the ‘ﬁt’ between two variables or the ‘modera- tion’ effect of one variable in the performance relationship of the other variable (Drazin and Van de Ven, 1985; Arnold, 1982; Venkatraman, 1989). Thus, it is not clear whether the signiﬁcance of the pair-wise interaction term provides empirical evi- dence for the ‘complementarity’ of the variables, the ‘ﬁt’ of the variables, or the ‘moderation’ effect of one variable in the performance relationship of the other variable. Such interpretational confound- ing can break down the sophisticated theoretical development and explanation behind our comple- mentarity hypothesis. Thus, we sought for an alternative statistical method that could account for the multilateral interactions and covariance among our main vari- ables. A second-order factor modeling approach provides a plausible alternative (Rindskopf and Rose, 1988). To test our strong-form (comple- mentarity) and weak-form (direct effects) hypothe- ses, we respectively used the structural models depicted in Figures 1 and 2. The complementarity model in Figure 1 includes a second-order fac- tor model of the knowledge synergy construct. A second-order factor is a general entity that is manifested or reﬂected by some ﬁrst-order fac- tors serving as its indicators (Williams, Gavin, and Hartman, 2004). The second-order factor is the main source of covariance among the ﬁrst- order factors. It explains why the ﬁrst-order factors coexist and co-vary with each other (Rindskopf and Rose, 1988). In Figure 1, different types of knowledge relatedness are modeled as ﬁrst-order factors (indicators) of the knowledge synergy con- struct. When taken independently, these ﬁrst-order factors capture sub-additive production cost syn- ergies arising from the relatedness of knowledge resources within product, customer, and manage- rial knowledge domains. The second-order factor models the complementarity of the ﬁrst-order fac- tors by accounting for their multilateral interac- tions and covariance (Rindskopf and Rose, 1988). The directions of the structural links are from the second-order factor to the ﬁrst-order factors, indi- cating that a multibusiness ﬁrm that is in pursuit of knowledge synergy seeks to achieve knowledge relatedness in a complementary set of knowledge domains simultaneously.

It states that any type of knowledge relatedness can have a direct effect on ﬁrm perfor- mance. But unlike the complementarity model in Figure 1, the direct effects model does not include a second-order factor accounting for the covari- ance of the ﬁrst-order factors. Put differently, the direct effects model does not posit any incremental explanatory power for the complementarity of the different types of knowledge relatedness. In Figure 1, the structural link from complemen- tarity to market-based performance (Tobin’s Q) is positive and signiﬁcant (structural link = 0.31, p < 0.001). The structural link from complemen- tarity to accounting-based performance (ROA and ROE) is also positive and signiﬁcant (structural link = 0.24, p < 0.001). These ﬁndings provide support for Hypothesis 1, the strong form of the two competing hypotheses. They indicate that a second-order factor accounting for the comple- mentarity of different types of knowledge related- ness has a positive effect on ﬁrm performance. In Figure 2, the direct effects model, only two of the 10 structural links from the knowledge relatedness constructs to performance constructs are signiﬁ- cant. Thus, Hypothesis 2, the weak form of the two competing hypotheses, is not supported. Test of alternative explanations for to assess if the complementarity After ﬁnding support in Figure 1, we added the control vari- model ables into the model the related diversiﬁcation component (DR) of the entropy measure of diversiﬁcation (Palepu, 1985), human resource relatedness (Farjoun, 1994), technolog- ical relatedness (Robins and Wiersema, 1995), ﬁrm size, risk level of the ﬁrm’s business port- folio, past performance of the ﬁrm, and indus- try performance could provide alternative expla- nations for our ﬁndings. Second, third, and fourth columns of Table 3 present the results respec- tively for Tobin’s Q, ROA, and ROE models. In the presence of all controls, knowledge synergy still had signiﬁcant associations with Tobin’s Q (structural link = 0.21, p < 0.001), ROA (struc- tural link = 0.21, p < 0.001), and ROE (struc- tural link = 0.17, p < 0.001). Knowledge syn- ergy accounts for about 4 percent of the vari- ance in each of the three performance measures after controlling for the variance explained by the control variables. Based on these ﬁndings, the most plausible alternative explanations to the per- formance effects of knowledge synergy can be ruled out. Table 3.

It also assessed performance effects of knowledge syner- gies using multiple objective measures of market- based and accounting-based ﬁrm performance. Theoretically, this study overcomes two major weaknesses observed in prior research on cross- business synergies in multibusiness ﬁrms. Most diversiﬁcation studies focus on individual mani- festations of a ﬁrm’s cross-business synergies by examining sources of synergy in selected func- tional domains. For example, they examine prod- uct relatedness, manufacturing relatedness, R&D relatedness, or technological relatedness to capture cross-business synergies in the product domain; market relatedness and advertising relatedness to capture synergies in the customer domain; or managerial relatedness to capture synergies in the managerial domain. This study conceptualized cross-business knowledge synergy as a cohesive, multidimensional corporate strategy, which drives knowledge relatedness in a complementary set of knowledge domains simultaneously. The superior- ity of the complementarity model in Figure 1 to the direct effects model in Figure 2 conﬁrms that the multiple manifestations of knowledge relatedness in product, customer, and managerial knowledge domains are all driven by a cohesive knowledge synergy strategy. Second, unlike most prior studies, which focused only on the similarity (relatedness) of resources as a source of cross-business synergy, this study recognized that the complementarity of different resources can also serve as an important source of synergy (Milgrom and Roberts, 1995), and an important basis for differentiating a ﬁrm’s corpo- rate strategy (Porter, 1996). The complementari- ties view of resource-related diversiﬁcation devel- oped in this study extends the resource-based view of related diversiﬁcation (Robins and Wiersema, 1995). While the resource-based view recognizes that the exploitation of common product, customer, or managerial knowledge resources across multiple businesses can respectively create product knowl- edge synergies, customer knowledge synergies, and managerial knowledge synergies, it does not recognize the synergies arising from the comple- mentarity of different types of knowledge related- ness. With its second-order, multidimensional con- ceptualization of cross-business knowledge syn- ergy, this study captures both the sub-additive pro- duction cost synergies arising from the relatedness of knowledge within product, customer, and man- agerial knowledge domains, and the super-additive value synergies arising from the complementarity of different types of knowledge relatedness. As the rich literature stream on the relationship between related diversiﬁcation and ﬁrm perfor- mance indicates, conceptualizing individual dimen- sions of a multidimensional relatedness strategy as independent strategies and examining their perfor- mance effects separately may lead to inconsistent and confusing results. If we had treated each type of knowledge relatedness as independent, as shown in Figure 2, we would have incorrectly concluded that relatedness in product knowledge, customer knowledge, or managerial knowledge domains did not have any signiﬁcant effects on ﬁrm perfor- mance. By modeling the complementarity of dif- ferent types of knowledge relatedness, we were able to discover that the performance effects of knowledge relatedness are achieved not through the isolated sub-additive production cost synergies in product, customer, or managerial knowledge domains per se, but through the super-additive value synergies that result from their coexistence and complementarity. Another theoretical advance of this study is that, in addition to examining relatedness of a ﬁrm’s internally generated knowledge resources, it also examines the relatedness of external knowledge resources that business units of the ﬁrm acquire from their alliance partners. Two of the new measures capture relatedness of product knowledge acquired through R&D and manufacturing alliances of the business units. A third measure captures the relatedness of customer knowledge and distribution alliances. As ﬁrms increasingly turn to strategic alliances for developing, manufacturing, and selling their products and services, knowledge acquired from alliance partners becomes an important source of synergy. By learning from individual businesses the alliance partners of and exploiting that learning in other business units as well, diversiﬁed ﬁrms can create cross- business knowledge synergies. As two of the four managerial knowledge relatedness measures through marketing acquired Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 97–119 (2005) 116 H. Tanriverdi and N. Venkatraman indicate, to exploit such synergies diversiﬁed ﬁrms may need to manage individual alliances of their businesses as part of a corporate-level portfolio of alliances. Methodologically, this study makes three major contributions. First, it measures knowledge relat- edness directly at the ﬁrm level by collecting data from managers of the ﬁrm instead of inferring it from industry participation of the ﬁrm and the resource similarities of industries. Since the man- agers’ view of relatedness departs signiﬁcantly from what is captured by external observations and approximations of relatedness (Nayyar, 1992; Prahalad and Bettis, 1986; Stimpert and Duhaime, 1997), the direct measurement of knowledge relat- edness at the ﬁrm level is a major methodological contribution that heeds the calls for increasing the correspondence between resource-based views of relatedness and operational measures of related- ness (Farjoun, 1994; Markides and Williamson, 1994; Robins and Wiersema, 1995). Second, this study develops a new response scale that captures actual relatedness rather than potential relatedness (Nayyar, 1992). Since the relatedness hypothesis of the diversiﬁcation research is about performance effects of actual resource sharing among business units of a diversiﬁed ﬁrm, it is important to capture the extent of actual resource sharing rather than the potential for resource sharing. The new response scale will allow future studies to conduct better tests of the relatedness hypothesis by enabling the measurement of actual rather than potential resource relatedness of business portfolios. Third, the new measurement items are designed and val- idated to capture knowledge relatedness of both service and manufacturing businesses. Prior relat- edness measures were developed, validated, and applied almost exclusively in the manufacturing sectors (Gassenheimer and Keep, 1998; Nayyar, 1992). Given that service sectors constitute a sig- niﬁcant portion of the economy, and that business portfolios of many diversiﬁed ﬁrms contain both service and manufacturing businesses, the devel- opment of measures that are applicable in both contexts is a major methodological contribution that can allow more diversiﬁcation studies in the service sectors and more accurate measurement of the relatedness of business portfolios containing both service and manufacturing businesses. With these improvements, and methodological theoretical this study was able to detect performance effects of cross-business knowl- edge synergies using both backward-looking accounting-based performance measures (ROA and ROE) and forward-looking market-based per- formance measures (Tobin’s Q). We ruled out potential alternative explanations to these ﬁndings by testing alternative measurement models for the knowledge synergy construct, by benchmarking it with three established measures of relatedness (DR, HRR, and TR), and by controlling for size, risk level, past performance, and industry perfor- mance of ﬁrms. Our ﬁndings also have important implications for practice. They indicate that the knowledge relatedness of a business portfolio is deﬁned by a complementary set of knowledge resources. Firms seeking to expand into related businesses should explore not only whether their individ- ual product, customer, or managerial knowledge resources are applicable in the new business but also whether successful operation in the new business requires the complementarity of those knowledge resources. If one of the complementary knowledge resources required by the new busi- ness is missing, the diversiﬁcation move may not succeed despite the presence of other types of related knowledge resources. Our ﬁndings suggest that diversiﬁcation moves are most likely to suc- ceed when the ﬁrm exploits a complementary set of product, customer, and managerial knowledge resources in the new business. Sporadic and iso- lated attention to the relatedness of an individual knowledge resource may not sufﬁce for successful diversiﬁcation and superior corporate performance. Before we conclude, we would like to point out some limitations of this study and offer them as possible avenues for extensions. First, the dimen- sionality of cross-business knowledge synergies is limited to three types of knowledge resources. Out of a concern for developing a construct that parsi- moniously captures the most strategic knowledge- based synergies of the ﬁrm, we left out other intan- gible sources of synergy such as brands and reputa- tion. Future work can assess whether the exploita- tion of a common corporate brand and common reputation across multiple businesses creates syn- ergies that explain variance in corporate perfor- mance over and beyond the variance explained by the three dimensions of knowledge relatedness examined in this study. Second, given our con- cern to detect performance effects of knowledge relatedness in a large, cross-sectional sample, we Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 97–119 (2005) Knowledge Relatedness and the Performance of Multibusiness Firms 117 adopted an outcomes approach rather than a mech- anisms approach to the measurement of knowledge relatedness. We did not theorize about or mea- sure the antecedent mechanisms that give rise to knowledge relatedness in product, customer, and managerial knowledge domains. We did not exam- ine how ﬁrms coordinate among the three knowl- edge domains to achieve complementarities either. What organizational structures and processes can be designed to enhance knowledge relatedness? What is the role of information systems in lever- aging a complementary set of related knowledge resources across business units? Further work on such antecedent mechanisms may allow us to better understand how organizations should be designed to capture value from knowledge-based synergies. Third, our cross-sectional data do not allow us to entirely rule out the possibility that unobserved factors may be driving our results. Future studies can more effectively address poten- tial endogeneity problems by using panel data and a ﬁxed effects model. Finally, the computation of the new knowledge relatedness measures entails some costs and challenges. Unlike other related- ness measures, which can be computed with read- ily available data in public archival sources, the new measures require primary data collection from executives of ﬁrms.
