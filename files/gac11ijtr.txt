López-Gamero*, José F. Molina-Azorín and Enrique Claver-Cortes Business Management Department, University of Alicante, Campus de San Vicente del Raspeig, Alicante,  Spain ABSTRACT The examination of the possible direct link  between environmental protection and ﬁ rm  performance has generally produced mixed  results. This paper contributes to the  literature by considering the antecedents of  hotel managers’ environmental attitudes to  check whether perceptions of the external  and internal factors are behind the adoption  of a proactive environmental management.  The study also tests whether or not the  resource-based view of the hotel mediates  the positive relationships of proactive  environmental management and improved  environmental performance with  competitive advantage and ﬁ nancial  performance. This contribution is original  because this study develops a  comprehensive whole picture of this path  process, which has previously only been  partially discussed in the literature.

INTRODUCTION Tourism  is  an  industry  that  depends  on  the  natural  environment  (Curtin  and  Busby, 1999). Recent research has empha- sized  the  importance  of  the  environment  for  tourism  activity  and  development  (Chan  and  Wong, 2006; Butler, 2008). It has also been con- cerned  with  the  impacts  that  tourism  has  on  natural resources (Claver et al., 2007; Shunnaq  et al., 2008). In the last United Nations Climate  Change  Conference  held  in  Copenhagen  in  December 2009, it has been told that the role of  tourism in the generation or control of green- house  gases  is  highly  relevant.  If  global  warming  takes  place  as  it  is  forecast,  at  the  very least, winter sports holidays, island holi- days and beach and sun holidays will be under  massive  pressure.  Certainly  it  will  mean  that  the  geography  of  the  tourism  industry  will  change dramatically (UNFCCC, 2010). In  this  context,  environmental  factors  have  gained  major  importance  (Curtin  and  Busby,  1999). An important question is what determines  hotels’  environmental  activities  and  commit- ment? Previous research across a range of disci- plines  has  attempted  to  identify  forces  that  motivate  and  encourage  ﬁ rms  to  respond  to  environmental  issues  (Aragón-Correa  et  al.,  2004).  Stakeholders  (such  as  customers,  local  Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 142  M. D. López-Gamero et al. communities,  government  agencies  and  public  interest  groups),  environmental  legislation  and  the  availability  of  resources  and  capabilities  to  implement  a  proactive  environmental  manage- ment1  are  considered  relevant  forces  that  affect  environmental  decision-making  and  actions  (Banerjee et al., 2003). Some research has pointed  out  that  there  are  links  between  top  manage- ment’s  perceptions  of  environmental  issues  as  threats  or  opportunities  and  choice  of  environ- mental management, so that a positive relation- ship  top  management’s  perceptions of environmental issues as opportu- nities and adoption of proactive environmental  management  (Sharma,  2000).  In  this  respect,  managerial perceptions of environmental issues  can  reﬂ ect  both  external  and  internal  driving  forces that affect environmental decision-making  and these forces may be considered in order to  adopt environmental management strategy. exists  between  The  hotel  industry  has  been  traditionally  considered  one  that  does  not  have  a  great  impact on the natural environment compared  to manufacturing industry. However, it gener- ates  much  more  negative  environmental  impacts  that  the  public  perceives,  consuming  a  vast  amount  of  local  and  imported  non- durable  goods,  energy  and  water,  as  well  as  emitting  a  large  amount  of  carbon  dioxide  (Bohdanowicz, 2006). As an emerging strategy,  environmental  management  has  increased  its  attraction by hotel managers because it encom- passes the technical and organizational activi- ties  undertaken  by  the  organization  for  the  purpose  of  reducing  these  environmental  impacts  and  minimizing  their  effects  on  the  natural environment (Cramer, 1998). Financial  performance  has  been  considered  one of the most visible advantages coming from  proactive  environmental  management  and  improved  environmental  performance.  Previ- ous  literature  has  underlined  ﬁ nancial  perfor- 1  ‘Environmental  management’  is  deﬁ ned  as  ‘the  equip- ment,  methods  and  procedures  used  at  the  production,  product  design  and  product  distribution  mechanisms  which  save  energy  and  natural  resources,  minimize  the  environmental  problems  generated  by  human  activities  and protect the natural environment’ (Shrivastava, 1995).  Proactive environmental management has been delimited  as  systematic  patterns  of  voluntary  practices  that  go  beyond regulatory requirements, for instance in terms of  waste  reduction  and  prevention  of  pollution  at  source  (Aragón-Correa and Rubio-López, 2007).’ Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.    mance of proactive environmental management  as one of the main drivers of going green, and  related environmental organizations have pro- vided quantitative evidence of cost and differ- entiation  advantages.  Bohdanowicz  (2005)  suggests  that  the  most  signiﬁ cant  beneﬁ ts  are  reduction  of  operating  costs,  demands  from  customers and improved hotel image. On  the  basis  of  the  ideas  discussed  above,  our study contributes to the literature because  we offer an analysis, based on a single frame- work, of the inﬂ uence that some external and  internal factors exert on managerial perception  about  the  natural  environment  as  a  competi- tive  opportunity,  and  additionally,  about  the  effect  that  this  managerial  perception  has  on  the  adoption  of  superior  proactive  environ- mental management schemes. We also analyse  the impact that proactive environmental man- agement  has  on  environmental  performance,  and  the  effect  that  these  environmental  vari- ables  have  on  competitive  advantage  and  ﬁ nancial  performance  through  the  resource- based view. We examine all these relationships  within  the  same  structural  equation  model.  Therefore, our proposal is original in explicitly  stating  and  testing  the  path  process  between  the different variables in our model. Although  this path process is implicit in many previous  works  (and  partially  discussed  in  some  theo- retical papers), we offer a whole picture. Finally,  research  about  a  ﬁ rm’s  response  to  environmental concerns has mainly focused on  the manufacturing industry. Service ﬁ rms have  been slower in taking positive action in envi- ronmental  matters  and  have  consequently  attracted much less research attention (Álvarez  et al., 2001; Ayuso, 2006). This is the case for the  tourism industry. Our research is a step in the  direction towards better understanding of the  peculiarities  of  the  hotel  industry  regarding  environmental protection. A number of reasons  justify our choice. For example, we selected the  tourism  industry,  and  more  speciﬁ cally  the  hotel industry, because of the relevance that this  area of activity has for Spain’s socio-economic  structure. The tourism industry was directly or  indirectly responsible for the generation of 11%  of the country’s gross domestic product in 2005  (INE, 2006) — and additionally, of 15% of the  employment created within the service indus- try  (National  Statistics  Institute  Information  Int. J. Tourism Res. 13, 141–163 (2011) DOI: 10.1002/jtr Managers’ Perceptions, Environmental Management and Firm Performance  143 Bulletin,  2005) — which  conﬁ gured  it  as  the  ﬁ rst  productive  industry  in  Spain.  Moreover,  the  tourism  industry  is  dependent  on  the  natural environment as the basis for the tourism  product  itself.  Shunnaq  et  al.  (2008)  highlight  the dilemma faced by tourism organizations as  there is a need to protect the environment both  for tourism and from tourism. Another reason  is the possibility of conceiving new ideas about  the link between tourism development and the  different  sustainability  dimensions  (environ- ment, society and economy). In fact, we view  ‘sustainable tourism’ as the development of a  tourist product that is more respectful of — or  less harmful to — the environment and which  at the same time, can offer a competitive advan- tage in the tourism market and ensure its long- term economic viability (Ayuso, 2006). This  paper  has  the  following  structure.  Firstly, we offer a literature review followed by  a presentation of the research design. Next, we  show the ﬁ ndings based on a structural equa- tion  model  for  the  hotel  industry  in  Spain.  Then, we discuss these ﬁ ndings, present some  managerial  implications  and  summarizes  the  main conclusions. BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES The relationship between internal and  external factors and managerial perception Environmental behaviour of ﬁ rms depends on  some  internal  and  some  external  forces  (Fraj- Andrés et al., 2008). These forces may inﬂ uence  the handling of an organization’s environmen- tal  concerns  but  do  not  homogenize  environ- mental  commitment  across  the  organizations  within  a  given  context.  Managers  who  are  accountable  for  an  aspect  of  organizational  functioning  therefore  have  opportunities  to  inﬂ uence  the  commitment  of  their  organiza- tion,  even  in  the  environmental  area,  where  external  pressures  (e.g.  new  environmental  laws)  are  numerous  and  sometimes  strong  (Aragón-Correa  et  al.,  2004;  Bohdanowicz,  2005).  Managers  signiﬁ cantly  inﬂ uence  the  environmental  commitment  of  their  ﬁ rms  through  their  interpretations,  preferences  or  decisions, which depend on the possibility of  gaining competitive advantage associated with  environmental actions (Miles and Covin, 2000). Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.    Environmental  regulations  have  been  the  main driving force behind managerial percep- tion (Banerjee et al., 2003). A number of authors  have actually argued that coercive forces could  drive  ﬁ rms  towards  more  proactive  environ- mental  strategies  through  the  possibility  of  avoiding some of the potential costs and legal  liabilities inherent in coercive green forces, to  pre-empt  more  extensive  and  stringent  coer- cive  regulations  and  to  minimize  the  uncer- tainty  that  is  characteristic  of  government  approaches  (Clemens  and  Douglas,  2006).  Rivera  and  Molero  (2006)  identify  a  positive  relationship  between  legislative  environmen- tal  pressure  and  managerial  perception  that  can  help  design  environmental  management  as  a  competitive  opportunity.  These  results  lead us to hypothesize the following: Hypothesis 1: The environmental legisla- tion  exerts  a  positive  inﬂ uence  on  the  manager’s perception about the environ- ment as a competitive opportunity. Stakeholders may inﬂ uence managerial percep- tion by means of two instruments: pressure and  cooperation. The pressure exerted by stakehold- ers  on  managers  is  increasingly  intense.  Pres- sure may separate the ﬁ rm from the rest of the  society, thus leading to a worsening reputation,  to  increased  costs  and  to  a  reduction  of  the  shareholder value because of the erosion of the  license  to  act  (Hill,  2001).  Therefore,  presum- ably, the stronger the pressure exerted by stake- holders, the greater the interest of managers in  protecting the environment. In turn, all this pressure pushes the ﬁ rm to  include an ability to develop collaborative rela- tionships with stakeholders for the purpose of  ﬁ nding  solutions  to  environmental  problems  (Sharma and Vredenburg, 1998). Sharma et al.  (2007)  indicate  that  managers  can  positively  value  the  potential  competitive  opportunities  derived  from  the  dialogue  with  their  stake- holders, as the latter will bring new ideas and  knowledge  likely  to  favour  an  anticipating,  preventive and innovative attitude within the  organization. Thus, ﬁ rms with managers who  view the wide variety of their stakeholders as  important will probably pay more attention to  the  development  of  proactive  environmental  strategies than those who focus on narrow sets  Int.

In  that  case,  we  can state the following two hypotheses: Hypothesis  2a:  A  stronger  pressure  exerted  by  stakeholders  on  the  ﬁ rm  has  a  positive  impact  on  the  perception  of  managers  about  the  environment  as  a  competitive opportunity. Hypothesis 2b: A greater collaboration of  stakeholders with the ﬁ rm has a positive  impact  on  the  perception  of  managers  about  the  environment  as  a  competitive  opportunity. Managers’  perception  of  environmental  responsibility  as  a  competitive  opportunity  also  depends  on  the  availability  of  comple- mentary  resources  and  capabilities  already  owned by the ﬁ rm (Hart, 1995; Aragón-Correa,  1998;  Christmann,  2000;  Aragón-Correa  and  Sharma, 2003). Nakamura et al. (2001) indicate  that  resources  and  capabilities  facilitate  ﬁ rm  adaptation  of  these  resources  thus  reducing  the costs of accommodating it to new environ- mental requirements. This may contribute to a  positive  perception  of  managers  about  the  environment  as  a  competitive  opportunity.  The  reason  is  that  these  resources  favour  the  adoption  of  practices  with  more  aggressive  environmental goals, extending them to skills  related to pollution proactive (Rondinelli and  Vastag, 2000). Additionally, these ﬁ rms will be  able to achieve greater environmental improve- ments because they can make a more efﬁ cient  use  of  their  internal  experience  and  obtain  constant  improvements  thus  enhancing  their  organizational  efﬁ ciency  (Christmann,  2000).  These arguments lead to another hypothesis: Hypothesis  3:  The  complementary  resources and capabilities available to the  ﬁ rm  positively  inﬂ uence  the  perception  of managers about the environment as a  competitive opportunity. The relationship between managerial  perception, resources and capabilities and  proactive environmental management Managerial  perceptions  about  the  characteris- tics of the environment inﬂ uence the extent to  Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.    which  managers  will  generate  proactive  envi- ronmental  strategies  (Sharma  et  al.,  2007).  Sharma  (2000)  shows  that  managers  exercise  strategic choice by undertaking environmental  management schemes, which relate to manage- rial  interpretations  of  environmental  issues  as  threats or as opportunities (Sharma et al., 1999). Some  internal  resources  and  capabilities  equally affect the environmental management  adopted  within  the  ﬁ rm  (Zhu  et  al.,  2008).  These  resources  vary  radically  depending  on  whether or not that ﬁ rm goes beyond compli- ance  to  embrace  proactive  pollution  (Russo  and Fouts, 1997). In addition, it also depends  on  how  managers  accept  their  leadership  responsibilities to deﬁ ne environmental behav- iour  and  to  pursue  it  relentlessly  as  a  top- priority  goal  (Thomas  et  al.,  2004).  Thus,  the  passive accommodating or proactive environ- mental attitude of managers and the available  resources  in  the  ﬁ rm  are  signiﬁ cant  factors  shaping  a  ﬁ rm’s  environmental  orientation.  When the manager has a passive or accommo- dating  attitude,  the  ﬁ rm  adopts  end-of-pipe  technologies. Instead, when the manager has a  proactive  attitude,  the  ﬁ rm  introduces  proac- tive technologies that can reduce pollution to  a greater extent or even remove it completely  from the productive process, as a result of the  investments made in clean technologies. Shifts  from  a  reactive  approach  towards  pollution  proactive  require  substantial  resource  alloca- tions in multiple domains, for example, invest- ments  in  green  products  and  manufacturing  technologies,  in  employee  skills  and  in  the  reconﬁ guration  of  the  strategic  planning  process  (Russo  and  Fouts,  1997;  Buysse  and  Verbeke,  2003).  All  these  arguments  lead  to  another two hypotheses: Hypothesis  4:  The  higher  the  degree  to  which the manager sees the natural envi- ronment  as  a  competitive  opportunity,  the higher the likelihood of developing a  proactive  environmental  management  scheme. Hypothesis 5: The greater the availability  of  complementary  resources  and  capa- bilities  in  the  ﬁ rm,  the  higher  the  likelihood of developing a proactive envi- ronmental management scheme.

The  environmental  management  literature has shown that the adoption of envi- ronmental practices by ﬁ rms typically leads to  or has to do with good environmental perfor- mance (e.g. Zhu and Sarkis, 2004). Better  environmental  performance  levels  can be derived from different types of environ- mental  practices  that  do  not  always  have  the  same  effects  on  environmental  performance.  Environmental performance relates to end-of- pipe  and  pollution  proactive  environmental  management.  One  would  expect  an  end-of- pipe  environmental  management  to  favour  improvement, mainly in the undesired outputs  of production processes, such as emissions into  the air and into the water, which result in few  positive effects on environmental performance  (Schaltegger and Figge, 2000). By contrast, efﬁ - ciency  improvements  brought  about  by  inte- grating  a  proactive  stance  on  pollution  can  encompass activities such as improvements in  the  ﬁ rm’s  energy-use  or  water-use  efﬁ ciency,  or  increased  resource  efﬁ ciency — that  is,  reduced amounts of production input per unit  of  product  output  (Wagner,  2005).  Therefore,  the effect of proactive environmental manage- ment  on  environmental  performance  should  be more positive than of end-of-pipe activities,  although  both  of  them  reduce  emissions.  Wagner (2005) demonstrates that high levels of  ﬁ rm performance coincide with high levels of  environmental  performance  only  if  the  ﬁ rm’s  environmental  management  technology  has  a  pollution  proactive  orientation.  All  the  above-mentioned  hypotheses  lead  to  another  hypothesis: Hypothesis  6:  A  positive  relationship  exists  between  proactive  environmental  management  and  environmental  perfor- mance improvement. role of mediating variables. Firm resources and  competitive advantage may play an important  role. The contribution of proactive environmental  management  to  competitive  advantage  is  in  terms  of  costs  and  differentiation  (González- Benito  and  González-Benito,  2005;  Galdeano- Gómez  et  al.,  2008).  Decisions  such  as  the  purchase of a new green technology, the consid- eration of greener distribution and transporta- tion systems, or the eco-design of products and  processes  will  allow  ﬁ rms  to  gain  competitive  advantages derived from cost reductions (Fraj- Andrés et al., 2008). Christmann (2000) provides  evidence  showing  that  the  higher  the  ﬁ rm’s  level of innovation in pollution proactive tech- nologies,  the  larger  the  cost  advantage  it  will  gain from environmental strategies. Differentia- tion advantages typically arise from the percep- tion on the part of customers that the product  is  more  valuable  (Bohdanowicz,  2005).  Thus,  differentiation  advantages  usually  depend  on  the  ﬁ t  of  product  characteristics  and  market  needs  and  on  the  ﬁ rm’s  ability  to  market  the  environmental characteristics of their products  and services (Galdeano-Gómez et al., 2008). In  this  relationship,  ﬁ rm  resources  should  be  considered  as  a  mediator  variable.  Firm  resources  have  been  the  output  of  proactive  environmental  management  strategies  (e.g.  continuous innovation or stakeholder manage- ment) and social reputation and legitimization  (Dinan, 2000; Aragón-Correa and Rubio-López,  2007).  Aragón-Correa  and  Sharma  (2003),  Christmann  (2000),  Sharma  and  Vredenburg  (1998)  and  Wagner  (2005)  identify  the  impor- tance  of  developing  superior  ﬁ rm  resources  based  on  the  ﬁ rm’s  relationship  with  the  natural environment as a source of competitive  advantage.  For  instance,  Miles  and  Covin  (2000) indicate that a ﬁ rm’s advantage in repu- tation  is  bound  to  favour  a  more  proﬁ table  exploitation  of  marketing  opportunities,  and  thus,  increase  market  value.  We  suggest  the  next two hypotheses: Environmental  protection  and  competitive  advan- tage through the resource-based view. The impact  of environmental variables on ﬁ nancial perfor- mance may not be an immediate one. Thus, it  is important to analyse the causal relationships  between  different  variables,  considering  the  Hypothesis 7a: The ﬁ rm resources gener- ated  through  proactive  environmental  management  mediate  the  positive  rela- tionship between proactive environmen- tal  management  and  cost  competitive  advantage. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.    Int. J. Tourism Res. 13, 141–163 (2011) DOI: 10.1002/jtr 146  M. D. López-Gamero et al. Hypothesis 7b: The ﬁ rm resources gener- ated  through  proactive  environmental  management  mediate  the  positive  rela- tionship between proactive environmen- tal  management  and  differentiation  competitive advantage. Other  studies  have  analysed  the  relationship  between  environmental  performance  and  com- petitive  advantage.  For  example,  Wagner  and  Schaltegger (2004) explain that the reduction of  environmental impact has a signiﬁ cant and posi- tive inﬂ uence on environmental competitiveness  dimensions (market-, internal-, proﬁ tability- and  risk-related environmental competitiveness). In this relationship, ﬁ rm resources should be  considered  as  a  mediator  variable.  Environ- mental  performance  encourages  the  develop- ment of new ﬁ rm resources. Konar and Cohen  (2001) extend the standard economic technique  of decomposing a ﬁ rm’s market value into its  tangible  and  intangible  assets,  by  separating  out environmental performance for intangible  assets  of  the  ﬁ rm.  Their  key  ﬁ nding  is  that  there  is  a  signiﬁ cant  positive  relationship  between  environmental  performance  and  the  intangible  asset  value.  Moreover,  these  assets  may improve the competitiveness of the ﬁ rm  (López-Gamero  et  al.,  2009).  Firms  with  very  low  manufacturing  emissions  with  respect  to  their  competitors  may  be  able  to  gain  a  ﬁ rst- mover advantage after improving their green  image  in  emerging  green  product  markets  (Roy,  1999).  In  the  light  of  the  reasons  men- tioned, we propose the following hypotheses: Hypothesis 8a: The ﬁ rm resources gener- ated  through  proactive  environmental  management  mediate  the  positive  rela- tionship  between  environmental  perfor- mance improvement and cost competitive  advantage. Hypothesis 8b: The ﬁ rm resources gener- ated  through  proactive  environmental  management  mediate  the  positive  rela- tionship  between  environmental  perfor- mance  improvement  and  differentiation  competitive advantage. Competitive advantage and ﬁ nancial performance.  Although  there  are  many  other  variables  Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.    involved,  the  ultimate  consequence  of  any  competitive  advantage  deriving  from  proac- tive  environmental  management  will  most  probably be an improvement in ﬁ nancial per- formance  (González-Benito  and  González- Benito,  2005).  Improving  their  environmental  performance  allows  ﬁ rms  to  enhance  their  competitive  edge  in  terms  of  reducing  costs,  gaining a strong reputation among customers  and  increasing  their  competitiveness  in  inter- national markets. These beneﬁ ts may, in turn,  positively  impact  on  the  ﬁ rm’s  overall  ﬁ nan- cial  performance  (Lindell  and  Karagozoglu,  2001).  Thus,  the  following  hypotheses  can  be  advanced: Hypothesis  9a:  Cost  competitive  advan- tage  has  a  positive  effect  on  ﬁ nancial  performance. Hypothesis  9b:  Differentiation  competi- tive  advantage  has  a  positive  effect  on  ﬁ nancial performance. Figure 1 shows our proposed model and the  hypotheses. METHODS Sample and data collection The population was made up of 3900 three-to- ﬁ ve-star  Spanish  individual  hotels  which  appeared in the Ofﬁ cial Hotel Guide published  by  Turespaña  in  September  2004.  These  cate- gories  corresponded  to  establishments  with  more  possibilities  to  apply  environmental  practices.  A  structured  questionnaire  with  closed questions was sent by post to the hotel  managers. The cover letter and the instructions  indicated  that  an  environment  manager —  or  otherwise  someone  familiar  with  these  issues — should  answer  the  questionnaire.  The interviewee could ﬁ ll in the questionnaire  on  a  web  page  too.  We  sent  four  reminder  emails  during  the  four  weeks  following  the  initial  mailing  so  as  to  encourage  response.  Moreover,  we  made  follow-up  phone  calls  starting  two  weeks  later.  Two  hundred  forty  hotels  sent  their  responses,  a  response  rate  that,  considering  the  length  of  the  question- naire  and  the  senior  level  of  the  managers  Int. J.

Hypothesized model targeted,  is  relatively  good  and  in  keeping  with those obtained by other researchers who  have  studied  similar  organizational  phenom- ena  in  Spain  (Brío  and  Junquera  2001;  Brío  et al. 2002; Carmona-Moreno et al. 2004). Prior to this, there was a pre-test stage which  involved 10 hotel managers and four research- ers  specialized  in  hospitality  management.  This pre-test stage helped to improve the struc- ture and content of the questionnaire. Regarding  the  sample,  59.3%of  the  respon- dents  were  three-star  hotels;  36.1%  corre- sponded  to  four-star  establishments  and  only  4.67% were ﬁ ve-star hotels. The average number  of employees in the hotels analysed was 48, the  maximum  value  for  that  variable  being  235  employees. The average size of the hotels was  130 rooms and 250 beds, and ﬁ nally, regarding  the type of hotel afﬁ liations, 41% of the estab- lishments  were  chain-afﬁ liated,  whereas  the  remaining 59% were independent. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.    In order to detect possible problems related  to non-response error or bias, we drew a com- parison  between  early  respondents  and  late  respondents  within  each  population  for  each  item  (Armstrong  and  Overton  1977),  after  which we divided the data obtained into thirds,  within  each  population,  according  to  the  number of working days elapsed between the  initial  mailing  to  the  ﬁ rm  and  the  receipt  of  the questionnaire. The t-tests between the ﬁ rst  and last third revealed no statistically signiﬁ - cant  differences  in  the  mail  responses  for  the  constructs  used.  Hence,  on  an  overall  basis,  non-response  bias  does  not  appear  to  be  a  problem in our study.

All  measures  were subjected to conﬁ rmatory factor analysis  to provide support for the issues of dimension- ality,  convergent  and  discriminant  validity.  Table 1 shows scale items, standardized load- ings, reliabilities and conﬁ rmatory factor anal- ysis results of the variables of the research. Environmental  legislation  (LEG).  This  variable  included  four  items  drawn  from  Dean  and  Brown  (1995),  King  (2000)  and  Porter  (1991).  We  asked  managers  to  position  their  respec- tive ﬁ rms on a scale of 1–7 depending on their  grade of agreement or disagreement with the  arguments of the issues related to environmen- tal  regulation.  Exploratory  principal  compo- nents analysis with varimax rotation of those  items showed that they formed only one factor  with eigenvalue >1. Cronbach’s alpha of envi- ronmental regulation is 0.61. Stakeholders  (STAKE).  It  was  deﬁ ned  as  any  person,  group  or  organization  that  has  direct  or indirect stake in an organization because it  can affect or be affected by the organization’s  actions,  objectives  and  policies.  This  variable  included  six  items  drawn  from Álvarez  et  al.  (2001).  We  used  seven  items  based  on  press  and  collaboration  of  the  stakeholders  in  their  relationships  with  the  ﬁ rm.  Each  item  was  measured on a 7-point Likert response scale (1  = ‘there are not any press or collaboration’, 7 =  ‘there are total press or collaboration’). Explor- atory  principal  components  analysis  with  varimax  rotation  of  those  items  showed  that  they formed two signiﬁ cant factors (eigenval- ues >1): F1 STAKE = degree of pressure exerted  by stakeholders (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.61) and  F2  STAKE  =  level  of  collaboration  with  these  groups (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89). Resources  and  capabilities  (R&C).  This  variable  included 11 items drawn from Aragón-Correa  (1998),  Christmann  (2000),  and  Hart  (1995).  Managers  had  to  evaluate  if  those  resources  had been used in the adoption of a proactive  environmental  management.  Each  item  was  measured  on  a  7-point  Likert  response  scale  (1  =  ‘strongly  disagree’,  7  =  ‘strongly  agree’).  Exploratory  principal  components  analysis  with  varimax  rotation  of  those  items  showed  that  they  formed  three  signiﬁ cant  factors  Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.    M. D. López-Gamero et al. (eigenvalues >1): F1 R&C = actions and degree  of involvement of the top management in the  ﬁ rm’s operations (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.81), F2  R&C = learning and knowledge of employees  (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.77) and F3 R&C = speed  and ﬂ exibility with which the ﬁ rm carries out  changes to adapt to new environmental condi- tions (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.76). Managerial  perceptions  (MAN).  This  variable  included seven items drawn from Del Brío et  al. (2003), Hutchinson (1992) and Nijkamp et al.  (1999).  We  asked  managers  to  position  their  respective ﬁ rms on a scale of 1–7 depending on  their  perception  about  the  natural  environ- ment  as  a  competitive  opportunity  or  as  a  threat (1 = ‘strongly opportunity’, 7 = ‘strongly  threat’).  Exploratory  principal  components  analysis with varimax rotation of those items  showed that they formed only one factor with  eigenvalue >1 (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.80). Environmental  management  (EM).  We  consid- ered two groups of items to measure the pro- activeness  of  the  environmental  management  drawn  from  different  studies  (Álvarez  et  al.,  2001; Carmona-Moreno et al., 2004): organiza- tional aspects (15 items) and technical aspects  (nine  items)  of  the  environmental  manage- ment.  Managers  were  required  to  evaluate  in  a  range  of  7  points  from  1  (they  had  not  addressed  that  issue)  to  7  (they  were  leaders  on  that  practice  in  their  sector)  if  they  had  adopted those environmental practices. Explor- atory  principal  components  analysis  with  varimax  rotation  of  items  of  ‘environmental  management-organizational  aspects’  showed  that they formed two signiﬁ cant factors (eigen- values >1): F1 EMORG = organizational aspects  linked to knowledge and learning in the devel- opment  of  environmental  practices  (Cron- bach’s alpha = 0.93), and F2 EMORG = variables  that reﬂ ected the link between the ﬁ rm and its  stakeholders  during  the  development  of  the  organization’s  environmental  management  strategy (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89). The ‘envi- ronmental  management-technical  aspects’  variable  was  measured  using  nine  items.  Exploratory  principal  components  analysis  with  varimax  rotation  of  those  items  showed  that  they  formed  only  one  factor  with  eigen- value >1 (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89). Int. J.

ENP variable  included nine items drawn from Stanwick and  Stanwick  (1998)  and  Wagner  et  al.  (2002).  We  asked managers to position his or her ﬁ rm on  a scale of 1–7 depending on the position of the  ﬁ rm in relation to competitors in environmen- tal performance issues such as efﬁ cient use of  resources,  reduction  of  emissions,  residues  and  acoustic  pollution,  so  on.  Exploratory  principal  components  analysis  with  varimax  rotation  of  those  items  showed  that  they  formed  only  one  factor  with  eigenvalue  >1  (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.93). New  resources  and  capabilities  (NERAC).  We  used seven items based on new resources and  capabilities  drawn  from  Aragón-Correa  and  Sharma  (2003),  Christmann  (2000)  and  Hart  (1995).  Managers  had  to  evaluate  if  new  resources  and  capabilities  had  developed  in  the ﬁ rm as a consequence of the adoption of a  proactive  environmental  management  (1  =  ‘strongly  disagree’,  7  =  ‘strongly  agree’).  A  factor analysis was carried out of those items,  resulting in one factor with eigenvalue >1 and  Cronbach´s alpha = 0.92. Competitive advantage (CA). We considered two  groups of items to measure that variable: com- petitive  advantage  on  costs  (CAC)  (four  items)  and  competitive  advantage  in  differentiation  (CAD)  (ﬁ ve  items),  which  were  drawn  from  Christmann  (2000),  Karagozoglu  and  Lindell  (2000)  and  Wagner  and  Schaltegger  (2004).  Through a 7-point Likert scale, managers rated  respective organization’s competitiveness rela- tive to that of other ﬁ rms in the sector. A factor  analysis  was  carried  out  on  the  data  for  the  items of competitive advantage on costs, result- ing in one factor with eigenvalue >1 and Cron- bach’s alpha = 0.78. In relation to the competitive  advantage  in  differentiation,  again  one  factor  was  found  in  the  factor  analysis,  with  eigen- value >1 and Cronbach’s alpha = 0.86. Financial performance (FP). We tested the model  using  a  perceptual  measure  with  three  items  (added value growth, economic and ﬁ nancial  proﬁ tability) in which, through a 7-point Likert  scale, managers rated their respective organi- zation’s  performance  relative  to  that  of  other  ﬁ rms  in  the  sector.

Control variable. Size (SIZE) was considered as  a  control  variable.  The  logarithm  of  a  ﬁ rm’s  number  of  employees  was  used  to  measure  SIZE. ANALYSIS AND RESULTS We  used  structural  equation  modelling  (LISREL 8.5) to examine our hypotheses, with  maximum  likelihood  with  robust  estimators  (Satorra and Bentler 1994) as a method to esti- mate  the  parameters,  because  multivariate  normal  distribution  was  no  longer  valid  and  the measurements for some variables were not  continuous. Our input matrix was the asymp- totic  variance–covariance  matrix.  We  take  LEG, STAKE — degree of pressure exerted by  stakeholders, STAKE — level of collaboration,  R&C — involvement  of  the  management,  R&C — employees’  learning  and  knowledge  and R&C — speed and ﬂ exibility to introduce  changes to adapt to the environment as exog- enous latent variables; and MAN, EM, NERAC,  CAC,  CAD  and  FP  as  endogenous  latent  variables. ‘R&C — involvement  of  the  relationships  between  Table 2 presents the means, standard devia- tions,  reliability  coefﬁ cients  and  correlations  among the variables.

There  are signiﬁ cant high and positive relationships  between  the  management’  and  the  dimensions  ‘R&C —  employees’  learning  and  knowledge’  and  ‘R&C — speed  and  ﬂ exibility  to  introduce  changes  to  adapt  to  the  environment’.  The  actions and degree of involvement of the top  management  in  the  ﬁ rm’s  operations  are  related  to  the  learning  and  knowledge  of  employees  and  the  speed  and  ﬂ exibility  with  which the ﬁ rm carries out changes to adapt to  new  environmental  conditions.

The  relationship between the two types of organi- zational aspects is strong, implying that if there  is  link  between  the  ﬁ rm  and  its  stakeholders  during the development of the organization’s  environmental management strategy they are  likely to regard knowledge and learning in the  development  of  environmental  practices  as  valuable.  Discriminant  validity  is  measured  calculating  the  reliability  coefﬁ cients  of  the  concepts and comparing them to the bivariate  correlation between pairs of constructs. All reli- ability coefﬁ cients exceeded the recommended  0.6 level and were greater than the correlation  between the two constructs of interest. The  process  of  testing  the  measurement  model is basically a conﬁ rmatory factor analy- sis  (CFA)  task,  based  on  the  knowledge  of  theory and empirical research, the hypotheses  linking the observed measures and the under- lying factors postulated a priori is being statisti- cally  tested.  CFA  was  conducted  to  assess  model ﬁ t (Jöreskog and Sorbom, 1993) for the  measurement  model.  The  ﬁ t  statistics  for  the  measurement model given in Table 3 indicate  Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.    that the measurement model ﬁ ts the data well.  Furthermore,  the  measures  of  error  were  uncorrelated, allowing progression to the next  stage  of  the  Structural  equation  modeling  (SEM) process. Seeking to reduce the number of parameters  to  estimate,  we  resorted  to  the  formation  of  compound variables, so that a single indicator  resulting from the sum of all parameters could  determine  each  factor  (Landis  et  al.,  2000).  Environmental  management  was  the  only  variable  that  was  considered  through  three  indicators  as  a  result  of  three  factors  (F1  EMORG,  F2  EMORG  and  EMTEC).  Each  of  these  indicators  was  also  resulting  from  the  sum of all indicators that could determine each  factor. Final results of this model revealed that each  ﬁ nal item signiﬁ cantly loads on its respective  construct showing high convergent validity of  the measurement scale for each construct. The  hypothesized model provided an acceptable ﬁ t  to the data. The Chi-square was signiﬁ cant (χ2  =  116.74,  df  =  67,  p  =  0.000)  and  ﬁ t  indices  clearly  exceeded  the  preferred  0.90  threshold  Int. J.

In relation to Hypothesis 3, there is a positive  effect of available resources and capabilities and  the  managerial  perception.  Consequently,  this  hypothesis  is  supported.

A discussion  of these results follows. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS Research on the response of ﬁ rms to environ- mental  concerns  has  mainly  focused  on  the  manufacturing industry. The impact caused by  the  hotel  industry  is  not  so  visible,  which  is  why these organizations have attracted much  less  research  attention.  Our  paper  is  a  step  towards a better understanding of the environ- mental  peculiarities  of  the  hotel  industry.  We  would like to emphasize the following results.  Good  business  and  sustainable  development  go  hand  in  hand.  Managers’  commitment  to  contribute  to  sustainable  development  holds  the  key  to  long-term  business  success  and  could become a source of competitive advan- tage.  These  perceptions  are  behind  the  adop- tion of an environmental management scheme  with a stronger focus on proactive techniques.  Environmental  legislation,  stakeholders,  as  well as the amount and type of resources and  capabilities available to the organization may  inﬂ uence  the  managerial  perception  of  the  natural  environment.  Once  the  ﬁ rm  assumes  its  environmental  responsibility,  there  is  no  reason  why  it  should  limit  its  organizational  capacity  when  applying  proactive  environ- mental  initiatives  to  improve  its  competitive- ness. Thus, the resource-based view mediates  the positive relationships of proactive environ- mental  management  and  improved  environ- mental  competitive  advantage  and  ﬁ nancial  performance.  Next,  we are going to provide discussion and impli- cations  of  each  relationship  showed  in  the  whole model. performance  with  Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.    Environmental  legislation  has  a  negative  signiﬁ cant  inﬂ uence  on  managerial  percep- tions  about  the  natural  environment.  Unlike  the research conducted with Spanish manufac- turing  industries,  which  reveals  government  and public regulations as the most important  reason  to  invest  in  environmental  issues  (Rivera-Camino, 2001), the hotel industry has  relatively  little  legislative  pressure  (Ayuso,  2006). Moreover, this legislation stems from a  control logic (López-Gamero et al., 2009). The  cost involved in complying with environmen- tal requirements when the ﬁ rm’s main concern  is  the  development  of  corrective,  end-of-pro- cess  actions  provokes  an  increase  of  the  total  cost incurred in the development of the whole  infrastructure that is necessary for the ﬁ rm to  adapt  to  the  new  regulatory  criteria.  Because  command-and-control regulations conform to  engineering rather than to business standards,  they  induce  unnecessary  capital  investments  and prevent good settling decisions (Tarui and  Polasky,  2005).  For  this  reason,  legislators  should  anticipate  how  the  regulation  might  affect not only current emission levels, but also  the investment in Research and Development  (R&D) by regulated ﬁ rms. Moreover, the pro- vision  of  education  and  information  on  envi- ronmental protection must be the result of the  joint, co-ordinated efforts of the public sector  and  the  hotel  industry  (Shunnaq  et  al.,  2008),  always seeking to increase the level of aware- ness  on  the  most  relevant  issues  and  on  the  possible methods to assess activities and imple- ment programmes, showing the best practices  and introducing training courses both for the  management  and  for  the  staff  (Stabler  and  Goodall, 1997). Regarding stakeholders, their pressure has a  signiﬁ cant negative effect on the perception of  managers about the environment as a competi- tive opportunity. Regarding the degree of col- laboration  in  environmental  issues,  it  is  not  signiﬁ cant. Customers and tour operators are  the  most  inﬂ uential  pressure  groups  inside  a  hotel  (Curtin  and  Busby,  1999;  Ayuso,  2006).  Nevertheless,  tourists  do  not  discriminate  between  hotels  according  to  environmental  practices, but they discriminate depending on  the  quality  of  the  service  offered,  to  such  an  extent that some authors argue that the imple- mentation  of  certain  environmental  practices  Int. J. Tourism Res. 13, 141–163 (2011) DOI: 10.1002/jtr Managers’ Perceptions, Environmental Management and Firm Performance  159 has as its aim to ‘disguise’ a cost-saving policy  (Font  and  Tribe,  2001).  Tour  operators  only  show an interest in environmental issues when  they  work  with  customers  from  Central  and  Northern  Europe  (Ayuso,  2006),  and  most  of  the  tourists  in  Spain  are  British  and  Spanish.  This low valuation can make managers reach  the  conclusion  that  meeting  the  demands  of  their  stakeholders  will  most  probably  reduce  their  competitiveness  levels  with  respect  to  other hotels which, in the absence of environ- mental  practices,  can  offer  their  services  at  a  more  competitive  price  to  a  customer  who  is  currently not very aware of these issues. More- over,  previous  interviews  and  observations  made in our study show that the participation  of  customers  in  environmental  issues  is  low,  similar  to  Enz  and  Siguaw’s  (1999)  study.  It  basically consists in completing questionnaires.  Tourists  have  quite  often  hindered  the  adop- tion of new environmental practices since they  believed that those practices might reduce the  service quality delivered by the hotel (Claver  et al., 2007). Decision-making and development  processes require stakeholders’ involvement at  all  planning  levels.  For  this  reason,  tourists,  residents and professionals should count on an  interpretative service based on environmental  education  (Holden  and  Sparrowhawk,  2002).  Ayuso (2006) and Zhu et al. (2008) observes that  stakeholders  generally  respond  with  higher  motivation to environmental practices after an  education period. This measure could raise the  quality of the experience and help them develop  greater awareness on the conservation and pro- tection  of  resources  (Tsaur  et  al.  2006).  For  example, Ayuso (2006) observes that employ- ees generally respond with higher motivation  to environmental practices after an education  and training period. In relation to the link existing between com- plementary resources and capabilities and the  managerial  attitude,  managers  see  the  hotel’s  capability to adapt quickly and ﬂ exibly to the  changes  operated  in  the  environment  as  an  important  asset.  This  ﬁ nding  also  resulted  from the study by Bansal (2005). Managers are  willing to incorporate environmental measures  because  they  think  that  environmental  con- sciousness  will  increase,  resulting  in  varying  tourist  demand  through  better  quality,  and  competition  between  destinations  will  proba- Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.    bly change the current context (Mihalic, 2000).  The success of this change will depend on the  capability to adapt to the new situation, that is,  on the possibility to have an easy access to the  information related to these practices, and on  the  know-how  available  in  the  organization  that  may  serve  to  develop  the  new  tasks  or  processes (Zhu et al., 2008). In essence, manag- ers  should  introduce  in-depth  changes  in  the  routines  and  management  style,  and  success  will consequently depend on the commitment  to  implement  environmental  strategies  and  develop learning processes. It  also  seems  that  proactive  environmental  management  leads  to  improved  environmen- tal  performance.  Our  results  coincide  with  those found in previous research studies (e.g.  Zhu  and  Sarkis,  2004).  A  good  measure  to  guarantee  an  improved  measurement  and  management  of  environmental  performance  within  the  hotel  should  be  the  diffusion  of  information on good environmental practices,  not  only  regarding  technical  product  and  process  innovation  but  also  in  management  practices. Similar to Aragón-Correa and Sharma (2003),  we have checked that the attitude and percep- tions  of  managers  appear  as  essential  factors  for the investment in proactive environmental  technologies.  Managers  therefore  have  a  chance to inﬂ uence the degree of environmen- tal  commitment  of  their  organization,  where  external  and  internal  pressures  are  important  and sometimes very strong (Aragón-Correa et  al., 2004). Fraj-Andrés et al. (2008) indicate that  managers’  involvement  with  environmental  issues is intensive in ﬁ rms that perceive envi- ronmental  regulations  as  a  threat.  This  con- ﬁ rms the results of our study. Managers should  take two aspects into account when they make  estimates  about  the  evolution  of  proactive  environmental management in the ﬁ rm. Firstly,  being  the  ﬁ rst  to  adopt  environmental  prac- tices  allows  managers  create  new  barriers  to  imitation, such as the possibility of inﬂ uencing  the  policy  process  (Cho  et  al.,  2006),  and  to  simultaneously  attract  consumers  who  share  environmental values to some extent and con- sider them in their decision-making. Secondly,  managers should consider aids and subsidies  that they can receive from the authorities, the  possible  low-interest  ﬁ nancing  offered  by  Int. J. Tourism Res. 13, 141–163 (2011) DOI: 10.1002/jtr 160  M. D. López-Gamero et al. some  ﬁ nancial  institutions  for  the  develop- ment  of  proactive  technologies,  and  also  the  reduction  in  their  insurance  premiums  as  a  result  of  the  diminished  environmental  risk.  This  is  a  method  to  alter  the  ‘incentives’  for  ﬁ rms to behave environmentally (Baumol and  Blackman  1991).  Moreover,  this  incentive- based  approach  to  the  business  environment  can  be  immensely  useful  for  regulators  to  guarantee observance of environmental behav- iour by ﬁ rms (Kulshreshtha, 2007). largely  With  regard  to  the  mediating  role  of  the  resource-based view in the relationship of pro- active  environmental  management  and  envi- ronmental  performance  with  competitive  advantage,  we  have  checked,  similar  to  Galdeano-Gómez et al. (2008) and Sharma and  Vredenburg (1998) found in their studies, that  investment  in  pollution  proactive  practices  and  environmental  performance  improve- ments contribute to the development of valu- able  capabilities  the  achievement  of  a  differentiation  competitive  advantage. These results show that managers  do  not  report  any  major  changes  in  the  cost  position relative to key competitors, but ﬁ rms  investing  improvements  have to some extent gained a stronger reputa- tion  among  customers.  Although  there  have  been  advances  in  products  and  processes,  the  more  signiﬁ cant  effects  seem  to  have  appeared  in  marketing  and  image  build- ing — a ﬁ nding obtained by Lindell and Kara- gozoglu  (2001)  as  well.  Thus,  managers  have  excellent opportunities to establish a close link  with customers and other stakeholders with a  view to develop loyalty and legitimacy based  on ecological preservation (Dinan, 2000), which  in turn will most probably lead to a differentia- tion  competitive  advantage  (Sharma  et  al.,  2007). in  environmental  that  favour  sense, managers in the hotel industry ought to  augment  organizational  capabilities  such  as  continuous  innovation,  employee  motivation,  and stakeholder involvement, as this will help  them reach cost competitive advantages. Competitive advantage has a positive effect  on ﬁ nancial performance. These results are rel- evant because they show that the ultimate con- sequence of any competitive advantage derived  from proactive environmental management is  an improved ﬁ nancial performance (González- Benito  and  González-Benito,  2005).  This  rela- tionship  also  appeared  in  studies  by  Claver  et  al.  (2007)  and  Lindell  and  Karagozoglu  (2001). Thus, managers should invest in envi- ronmental management because the adoption  of environmental measures might help differ- entiate  them  from  their  less  environmentally  friendly  competitors  and  thus  lead  to  higher  returns.  For  instance,  hotels  can  achieve  a  market  advantage  by  deﬁ ning  the  environ- mental  proﬁ le  of  their  services,  thereby  con- tributing to the general attributes of the tourism  product. Finally, some limitations and future research  lines  should  be  noted.  Firstly,  since  this  research  paper  relies  heavily  on  self-reported  measurements  provided  by  ﬁ rm  managers,  future research works could add to the conﬁ - dence place in the results reported here by rep- licating  this  study  with  more  direct  objective  measurements  of  the  theoretical  constructs.  Even so, in relation to environmental manage- ment,  this  alternate  approach  may  also  be  inadequate  since  it  may  not  fairly  reﬂ ect  a  ﬁ rm’s overall environmental management due  to its multidimensional nature. As Grifﬁ n and  Mahon (1997) explicitly discuss in their studies,  environmental management is a ‘social perfor- mance’  variable.  Secondly,  it  would  be  inter- esting  to  establish  causal  interrelationships  between  the  factors  considered  in  the  study:  for  instance,  environmental  legislation  may  inﬂ uence the pressure exerted by stakeholders  on  the  ﬁ rm;  or  the  availability  of  certain  resources and capabilities is likely to facilitate  legislative  compliance,  among  other  things.  Possibly, the results obtained will only be valid  for the hotel industry examined in the Spanish  context.  That  is  why  a  future  line  of  research  could  also  be  to  extend  the  analysis  to  other  countries. Best practices aimed at larger investments or  higher  added  values,  as  well  as  the  adoption  of formal certiﬁ cation systems, have a tangible  cost  for  the  hotels. At  the  moment,  ﬁ rms  see  these costs as investments not leading to com- petitive advantages. Thus, the implementation  of more costly practices will largely depend on  the  availability  of  sufﬁ cient  ﬁ nancial  and  human resources and public funding to imple- ment environmental management systems and  certify  for  the  eco-label  (Ayuso,  2006).
