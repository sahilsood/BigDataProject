Asia Pac J Manag (2014) 31:925–947 DOI 10.1007/s10490-013-9369-1 Corporate social responsibility, firm reputation, and firm performance: The role of ethical leadership Yan Zhu & Li-Yun Sun & Alicia S. M. Leung Published online: 5 November 2013 # Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013 Abstract This study investigated the antecedents and outcomes of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the moderating effects of ethical leadership. We collected two- wave, temporally lagged data from two sources (general and vice-general managers) in 199 tourism firms (hotels and travel agencies) in southeast China. We have two major findings. First, ethical leadership moderated its own indirect effect on firm reputation via CSR. It had an indirect and positive effect on firm reputation through CSR when ethical leadership was strong but not when it was weak. Second, ethical leadership also moderated the indirect effect of CSR on firm performance via firm reputation. There was an indirect and positive effect of CSR when ethical leadership was strong but not when ethical leadership was weak. This study highlights the role of ethical leadership in linking the antecedents and outcomes of CSR, and provides support for the stakeholder theory. Keywords Corporate social responsibility (CSR) . Ethical leadership . Firm performance . Firm reputation Why should companies take responsibility for noneconomic stakeholders, such as employees, customers, and the community (Clarkson, 1995; Donaldson & Preston, 1995; Lee, Kim, Lee, & Li, 2012; O’Shaughnessy, Gedajlovic, & Reinmoeller, 2007)? Theoretically, scholars continue to find the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on firm performance (Lai, Chiu, Yang, & Pai, 2010; McWilliams, Siegel, & Wright, 2006; Orlitzky, Schmidt, & Rynes, 2003; Ye & Y.

Practically, more and more firms are now aware that engaging in CSR can ensure their sustainability and promote their accountability (Cockburn, Henderson, & Stern, 2000). Take Chinese firms as example, the notion of developing business ethics in response to today’s increasing demands of CSR is enhanced within the context of recent business scandals, food safety, labor issues, and environmental deterioration. In spite of the tremendous efforts in the study of CSR, four important issues need to be addressed further. First, studies on the relationship between CSR and firm performance have yielded inconsistent and contradictory results. Some researchers have found a positive association between CSR and firm performance (e.g., Mishra & Suar, 2010; Okamoto, 2009), while others have found no relationship (e.g., Aupperle, Carroll, & Hatfield, 1985; Teoh, Welch, & Wazzan, 1999) or even a negative association (e.g., Bromiley & Marcus, 1989; Wright & Ferris, 1997). This controversy reflects the tensions that managers face when they have to make decisions that involve tradeoffs between the economic, environmental, and societal dimensions (Margolis & Walsh, 2003). In this sense, the association may be “more illusory than the body of results suggests” (Margolis & Walsh, 2003: 278). If tensions do exist, they could represent a fruitful area for exploration (Strand, 2011). One area worthy of exploring is to open the “black box” in the CSR-performance relationship and to explain why and how CSR affects performance (Zairi & Peters, 2002), thereby providing a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship. Second, though much research has examined the impact of CSR on firm performance, little has been done to uncover the intermediate process linking CSR and performance. Many studies have indicated that CSR and firm reputation generate positive brand image (Brickley, Smith, & Zimmerman, 2002; Jones, 2005; Smith & Higgins, 2000; Varadarajan & Menon, 1988). “Brands based on intangible, emotive characteristics—are seen as more durable and less likely to suffer from competitive erosion” (Lynch & de Chernatony, 2004: 403). We speculate that the intangible aspect of firm reputation may be an important source of sustainable competitive advantage. Surprisingly, firm reputation remains underemphasized in research (Lai et al., 2010) and few studies have explored its impact on performance. Researchers have called to answer how CSR can be used as an instrument to enhance firm reputation and further firm performance (e.g., Bhattacharya, Korschun, & Sen, 2009; Sen, Bhattacharya, & Korschun, 2006). Given that prior studies have primarily assumed a direct relationship between CSR and firm performance, exploring the mediating effect of firm reputation contributes to our understanding the mechanism through which CSR affects firm performance. Third, though CSR is frequently used to convey firms’ commitment to stakeholders, little evidence has shown to what extent leadership involves in CSR. CSR has been criticized as insulated and self-serving because firms might use CSR to disguise irresponsible behavior in the core business (Hooghiemstra, 2000; Luo & Bhattacharya, 2009; Vlachos, Tsamakos, Vrechopoulos, & Avramidis, 2009). If a firm is using CSR simply as a marketing tool to gain advantage (Brønn & Vrioni, 2001; Waller & Lanis, 2009), such as increasing visibility rather than of creating social impact, it may lose its core consumers and jeopardize its long term economic sustainability (Luo & Bhattacharya, 2009). In that case, what role does leadership play? “What is the impact of leadership on the CSR engagement and performance of Corporate social responsibility 927 integrity, accountability, the corporation?” and “What kinds of leadership support CSR engagement and performance at the corporation” (Strand, 2011: 84)? Since ethical leadership fosters the values of fairness, and ethical behaviors in the organization and the community (Mayer, Aquino, Greenbaum, & Kuenzi, 2012; Resick, Hanges, Dickson, & Mitchelson, 2006; Walumbwa, Mayer, Wang, Wang, Workman, & Christensen, 2011), we thus wonder whether ethical leadership could shape the perception of firms’ CSR. Fourth, while CSR has been acknowledged as one of key factors contributing to corporate reputation (Balmer, 2009; Worcester, 2009), the motivation for CSR initiatives is often driven by promoting some kind of self-interest (Moon, 2001). Klein and Dawar (2004) assert that stakeholders are increasingly skeptical and sophisticated about reasons for companies engaging in CSR. In this context, will CSR really lead to firm reputation? Paucity of research has investigated under what circumstances the CSR activities of a company achieve the desired effects (Maignan & Ralston, 2002). In view of the limitations discussed above, this paper examines the antecedents and outcomes of CSR and the moderating role of ethical leadership. Specifically, the objectives of this study are to examine (1) the main effect path of ethical leadership ➔ CSR ➔ firm reputation ➔ firm performance; (2) the moderating effect path of ethical leadership moderating CSR ➔ firm reputation relationship; and (3) the moderated indirect effect paths whereby the indirect effect of ethical leadership is moderated via CSR, and further moderates the indirect effect of CSR on firm performance via firm reputation (see Fig. 1). This study is a response to researchers’ calls for a more direct assessment of the moral and ethical qualities of leaders in the CSR research. This is because integrity or other moral aspects of leadership might be more directly related to CSR (Waldman, Siegel, & Javidan, 2006). Ethical leadership thus presents a promising area for CSR exploration (Strand, 2011). In addition to seeing ethical leadership as an antecedent to CSR, we also view it as a boundary condition for the direct effect of CSR on firm reputation and the indirect effect of CSR on firm performance via firm reputation. Literature review and hypotheses Ethical leadership and CSR The proposed positive relationship between ethical leadership and CSR is underpinned by stakeholder theory. Stakeholder theory addresses morals and values of managing an organization among all of its stakeholders (Phillips, Freeman, & Wicks, 2003). Today’s business leaders operate in a global, volatile, and increasingly complex business environment. Therefore it is helpful to discuss leadership in the Ethical  leadership Perceived corporate social responsibility Firm reputation Firm performance  Fig. 1 Hypothesized model 928 Y. Zhu et al. context of stakeholder theory because a business organization is seen as composed of various constituencies (employees, clients, suppliers, managers, shareholders, communities, etc.) all of whom have a legitimate strategic and moral stake in the organization (Bass & Steidelmeier, 1999). Stakeholder theory posits that business leaders should serve the interests of all stakeholder groups, and stakeholder relationships are considered critical to business success (Donaldson & Preston, 1995; Maak, 2007). Hence, the responsibility of business leaders cannot be limited to maximizing shareholders’ wealth and by necessity it must extend to different types of stakeholders. Ethical leadership is defined as “the demonstration of normatively appropriate conduct through personal actions and interpersonal relationships, and the promotion of such conduct to followers through two-way communication, reinforcement, and decision-making” (Brown, Treviño, & Harrison, 2005: 120). Normatively appropriate conduct reflects the moral component of ethical leaders who possess desirable traits such as fairness, honesty, and trustworthiness in taking responsibility for their own actions, as well as the use of appropriate rewards and punishments to hold subordinate accountable for their actions (Piccolo, Greenbaum, Hartog, & Folger, 2010). They not only behave in an ethical manner, thereby setting an example of ethical behavior, but also communicate the importance of ethics. They also use punishment to discourage unethical behavior and reward systems to encourage normatively appropriate behavior in the workplace (Brown et al., 2005). At the same time, ethical leadership should actively manage morality, referred to as moral identity (Mayer et al., 2012). The centrality of moral identity is to motivate leaders to act in ways that are consistent with their understanding of what it means to be a moral person. It demonstrates responsiveness to the interests and expectations of others because acting otherwise can produce dissonance and self-condemnation. For example, research has found that moral identity is predictor of pro-social behaviors such as charity donations (Reed, Aquino, & Levy, 2007) and is negatively related to unethical behaviors such as cheating (Reynolds & Ceranic, 2007). Ethical leaders are responsible individuals who live by values and principles and have potential for contributing to the betterment of the society (Maak & Pless, 2006). From stakeholders’ perspectives, ethical leaders possess the art of building and sustaining good relationships with all relevant stakeholders, and their relationships with them are connected through a shared sense of meaning and purpose. By doing so, they create incentives to encourage respectful collaboration, improve motivation and commitment for achieving sustainable and responsible change inside and outside the organization (for a review, see Maak & Pless, 2006). For example, ethical leaders have a moral obligation to provide safe, healthy, and non-discriminatory working conditions for employees and a moral obligation for their customers through providing safe products and services that meet their needs and expectations. Ethical leaders ensure that the potential risks of products and services are openly and transparently communicated to meet the needs of their customers for safety. To the community, ethical leaders need to be sensitive to the world in which they operate. They assess the impact of business decisions on the natural and social environments. They also ensure that production processes are as environmentally friendly as possible. The ultimate goal of ethical leadership is to achieve a common good such as business sustainability and organizational legitimacy (Bass & Steidelmeier, 1999). Corporate social responsibility 929 To this end, ethical leaders envision their core task is “to weave a web of inclusion” of all different stakeholder groups and keep each of these diverse stakeholders motivated (Maak, 2007; Maak & Pless, 2006). leaders Owing to the critical role of ethical leadership in the organization, there is a growing body of empirical research that examines its antecedents and outcomes. Personality traits of such as agreeableness and conscientiousness (Walumbwa & Schaubroeck, 2009) and moral identity (Mayer et al., 2012) are found to be positively related to ethical leadership. Moreover, ethical leadership can lead to employees’ citizenship behaviors (Piccolo et al., 2010) and other positive outcomes such as job satisfaction and helping behaviors (Avey, Wernsing, & Palanski, 2012; Kacmar, Andrews, Harris, & Tepper, 2013). Researchers have recently paid attention to the moderating effects of ethical leadership. For example, Philipp and Lopez (2013) argued that ethical leadership moderates the relationships between psychological contracts and organizational outcomes such as commitment and citizenship behavior. Liu, Loi, and Lam (2013) demonstrated that ethical leadership moderates the relationship between exemplification and in- role performance rating, but not between exemplification and extra-role performance rating. CSR shares value congruence with ethical leadership. CSR refers to the sum of “economic, legal, ethical, and discretionary expectations that society has of in time” (Carroll & Buchholtz, 2003: 36). The organizations at a given point definition implies that organizations have ethical and philanthropic responsibilities to stakeholders as well as their obligations to perform well economically and comply with the law. Hence, CSR embraces a wide range of citizenship behaviors, such as being environmentally friendly, ensuring employee welfare benefits, protecting shareholder rights, and engaging in those types of public activities that are deemed worthy and legitimate according to the organization’s legal and ethical standards. These socially responsible behaviors influence a wide range of stakeholder groups (employees, customers, suppliers, non-governmental organizations, etc.) and have typically been seen as discretionary in terms of promoting social interest. Overall, CSR reveals the way a company balances its economic, social, and environmental objectives while addressing stakeholder expectations and enhancing shareholder value. In an effort to meet stakeholder expectation, ethical leaders will try to improve their environmental, social, and ethical performance. An assessment of stakeholder perceptions toward CSR may influence business leaders’ response to CSR initiatives (Morsing & Schultz, 2006). Researchers have provided empirical support for the impact of ethical leaders on their followers’ perceptions in the stakeholder view of CSR (Groves & LaRocca, 2011). Vitell et al. (Vitell & Paolillo, 2004; Vitell, Paolillo, & Thomas, 2003) suggested that organizations can positively influence their employees’ perceptions of CSR by developing and enhancing a clear set of ethical values and policies. Furthermore, other researchers (e.g., Puffer & McCarthy, 2008; Schaubroeck et al., 2012) extend this argument by proposing that a company’s social responsibility must rest on an organizational culture that is grounded on ethical values. In this case, a firm’s ethical behavior reflects the values and beliefs espoused by the leader. This notion is relevant to the work of Mendonca (2001), who argued that such leaders are likely to be guided by altruistic moral principles that involve a 930 Y. Zhu et al. direct concern for others, even when this requires acts that demand personal sacrifice or inconvenience. Ethical leaders therefore may address the interests and expectations of all stakeholders through integrating CSR into core business activities. We thus expect a positive relationship between ethical leadership and CSR. Hypothesis 1 Ethical leadership is positively related to CSR. CSR and firm reputation Fombrun (1996: 72) defined firm reputation as “a perceptual representation of a company’s past actions and future prospects that describe the firm’s overall appeal to all its key constituents when compared to other leading rivals.” According to Fombrun (1996), firm reputation consists of four key characteristics: credibility, reliability, responsibility, and trustworthiness. In particular, the term reputation denotes a summative representation of stakeholders’ judgments of the firm over time (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990). As a “social approval asset” (Pfarrer, Pollock, & Rindova, 2010) that signals stakeholders’ perception of a firm’s ability to create value relative to its competitors, reputation can be used as a strategic or investment tool in response to stakeholders’ expectations to project a favorable corporate image (Jones, 2005; McWilliams et al., 2006). In this light, reputation is largely derived from the collective recognition of a firm’s ability to fulfill the interests of its stakeholders over time. There is a prevailing consensus that CSR activities can be translated directly into organizational reputation. Research provides support for the positive association between CSR activities and corporate reputation (e.g., Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Lai et al., 2010; Stanaland, Lwin, & Murphy, 2011). Firms with a strong CSR are likely to gain trust from different stakeholders because this offers an indicator of good-quality management. From the customer perspective, researchers have found that customer perception of a firm’s CSR activities is positively related to their evaluation of its reputation (Lai et al., 2010; Stanaland et al., 2011). From the employee perspective, employees’ perception of their organizations’ CSR is linked to their level of organizational commitment, which enhances their ratings of their firms’ reputation (Stawiski, Deal, & Gentry, 2010). Based on the theoretical and empirical research on corporate socially responsible behaviors and firm reputation, we propose the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 2 CSR is positively related to firm reputation. Firm reputation and performance Hall (1993: 616) viewed a firm’s reputation as the most important intangible asset contributing to its performance because it is the “product of years of demonstrated superior competence, and is a fragile resource; it takes time to create, it cannot be bought, and it can be damaged easily.” Because it can generate trustworthiness, reliability, and responsibility from key stakeholder groups through the development of appropriate caring relationships with them, corporate reputation positively affects firm performance. Indeed, there are a number of empirical studies that support this Corporate social responsibility 931 view (Fombrun & Shanley, 1990; Rindova, Williamson, Petkova, & Sever, 2005; Roberts & Dowling, 2002). For example, Rindova et al. (2005) demonstrated that a firm’s reputation for quality and its general prominence (that is, the collective awareness and recognition of an organization over time in the industry) has a distinct effect on performance. Greenwood, Li, Prakash, and Deephouse (2005) also showed that corporate reputation is positively related to the performance of professional service firms because it serves as a social signal to clients to help them strategically position themselves in the market. From customers’ perspective, Walsh, Mitchell, Jackson, and Beatty (2009) argued that a reputable company who aims to provide quality products or services to earn the trust of its customers, can grow positive word of mouth, build customer loyalty, and maximize profits. A more recent study by Boyd, Bergh, and Ketchen (2010) also supports the view that a favorable reputation has a positive performance impact. In the workplace, corporate reputation can help entice and retain employees who are more productive and motivated in their job, which in turn enhances firm performance. Overall, firm reputation enhances (Pfarrer et al., 2010), employees, customers (Highhouse, Brooks, & Gregarus, 2009), and other stakeholders. We thus propose the following hypothesis: the satisfaction and loyalty of investors Hypothesis 3 Firm reputation is positively related to firm performance. Moderating role of ethical leadership ethical leadership promotes CSR, which further As discussed above, the effect of CSR on firm contributes to firm reputation. We argue that leadership, which provides an ethical reputation is contingent upon ethical organizational climate. Specifically, ethical leaders frequently communicate ethical values to their followers, set clear and consistent ethical standards, reward ethical behavior, and punish unethical behavior (Brown & Treviño, leadership can safeguard a company’s reputation and 2006). Further, ethical credibility by emphasizing ethical decision making, and strengthening stakeholder relationships. Under strongly ethical leadership, firms engaging in CSR practices tend to build trust-based relationship with their stakeholders. Whether or not the CSR activities are effective depends on the extent to which leaders demonstrate their sincerity towards the CSR. In other words, strong ethical leaders must be prepared to make a personal involvement to ensure long-term commitment to CSR activities. More importantly, we argue that CSR is positively related to firm reputation only when leaders display strong ethical leadership. It is because they implement CSR with consistency and determination, backed up by promises with solid action, which will ultimately create sustainable value for both shareholders and stakeholders over time. If CSR and weak ethical leadership coexist in an organization, their contradictions can become a destructive force. CSR is not a “quick fix” project. When leaders have low or no intention to invest in CSR, any attempts to embark in CSR programs for their companies will be seen as greenwashing or questionable activities in the public eye. Thus, we propose: 932 Y. Zhu et al. Hypothesis 4 Ethical leadership moderates the relationship between CSR and firm reputation such that perceived CSR positively affects firm reputation when leaders display strong but not weak ethical display strong, but not weak, ethical leadership. We posit that ethical leadership positively affects CSR, which further positively affects firm reputation, and that ethical leadership moderates the relationship between CSR and firm reputation. Based on these hypotheses, it is logical to predict that strong ethical leadership will have an indirect effect on firm reputation through CSR. However, it will have no indirect effect on firm reputation when leaders display weak ethical leadership. We further predict that firm reputation mediates the relationship between CSR and firm performance. CSR is viewed as the guarantor to ensure stakeholder satisfaction and the distribution of value to all stakeholders. CSR thereby enables firms to improve reputation with, and gain support from, a broad range of stakeholders. Firm reputation is rooted in the aggregated assessments of the firm’s stakeholders. Support from the stakeholders, such as consumers (to buy/recommend/say positive things), media (to promote products and services), and shareholders (to invest), will lead to superior firm performance. Researchers argue that CSR initiatives can create reputational advantages such as building trust, securing financing from new projects, and new market opportunities (Fombrun, Gardberg, & Barnett, 2000; Porter & van der Linde, 1995). CSR thus generates indirect economic benefits through developing a favorable firm reputation. To this point, we contend that ethical leaders should enhance firm reputation as a result of companies investing more in CSR programs and adopting more CSR practices, which should further positively influence performance. Accordingly, leaders with weak ethical leadership will not enhance firm reputation even if they implement more CSR initiatives (as seen, e.g., in the case of Enron scandal), which can bring negative impact on firm performance in the long run. In other words, when leaders display strong ethical leadership, an increase in CSR will be associated with an increase in performance due to the enhancement of reputation. When leaders display weak ethical leadership, an increase in CSR will not be associated with a performance increment because reputation will be unaffected. Thus, the following hypotheses are presented: Hypothesis 5 Ethical leadership moderates its indirect effect on firm reputation through CSR. Specifically, the indirect effect holds when leaders display strong, but not weak, ethical leadership. Hypothesis 6 Ethical leadership moderates the indirect effect of CSR on firm performance through firm reputation. Specifically, the indirect effect holds when leaders display strong, but not weak, ethical leadership. Methods Sample and data collection We selected our sample from tourism firms in three cities (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai) in Guangdong Province, China. The three cities have the most thriving Corporate social responsibility 933 tourism industry. The tourism industry has a broader social responsibility for the public good, due to its impact on economies, societies, cultures, and environments (de Grosbois, 2012; Hall & Brown, 2006; Henderson, 2007), and for the sustainability of the industry itself (Bramwell & Lane, 1993; Müller, 1994). With the increasing awareness of the need for ethical and sustainable practices (e.g., the green hotel movement, the reduction of energy consumption, and charitable donations) in the Chinese tourism industry, Chinese tourism companies are beginning to incorporate CSR in their strategic plans as an essential element for long-term sustainability. This means that strategic CSR practices are emerging in the Chinese tourism industry. Researchers thus are increasingly interested in CSR within this industry from different angles and multiple perspectives (Gu, Ryan, Bin, & Wei, 2013). We collected data in two major tourism sectors: hotels and travel agencies. To encourage a higher response rate, we pretested the questionnaires with top executives in 10 selected tourism companies to determine whether the questions were realistic, understandable, and generalizable in the Chinese context. Their comments and suggestions were incorporated into the final instruments. We gained access to the participating firms in the three cities through a combination of personal contacts and a snowballing technique that used the contacts of contacts. This approach is particularly effective and useful in China, where personal networks (or guanxi) significantly facilitate company access (Sun, Aryee, & Law, 2007). To minimize the potential impact of common method bias, we collected data from two different sources at two different points in time. In Round 1 of data collection, we distributed the surveys on CSR and general managers’ ethical leadership to vice-general managers. These are top-level executives who are familiar with the leadership styles of general managers. In Round 2 (1 month later), we distributed the surveys on firm reputation and performance to general managers. General managers handle functions such as personnel, finance, and sales and marketing, and take responsibility for the company’s overall performance. Hence, they are in a position to provide an overall assessment of the firm’s performance and reputation. The project coordinators were fully informed about the questionnaire- distribution procedures in both rounds of data collection. In Round 1, we sent the first batch of questionnaires to one project coordinator who was responsible for contacting the general secretary of the Zhuhai Tourism Association, which is in charge of more than 100 local star-rated hotels and travel agencies. The general secretary then distributed the questionnaires to the vice-general managers of those hotels and agencies when they were gathered in one place for the association conference. Some of the managers completed and returned the questionnaires on the spot, whereas others took them home to fill out and then returned the completed surveys by fax. We sent the second batch to the vice-general managers of tourism companies in Guangzhou and Shenzhen through coordinators, each of whom was responsible for 10–15 organizations. After 2 weeks, one of the authors contacted the general secretary in charge of the Zhuhai survey and the coordinators in charge of the Guangzhou and Shenzhen surveys to remind them to return the questionnaires that had been completed by the vice-general managers. For the data collection in Round 2, we followed the same procedures as described in Round 1. In total, we distributed questionnaires to 390 companies. From the 780 questionnaires sent to 390 tourism companies, a total of 416 completed surveys from 208 companies were returned, giving a response rate of 53 %. After incomplete questionnaires were excluded, data from 199 companies 934 Y. Zhu et al. constituted the sample for this study. Of these 199 companies, 64.8 % had been in existence for more than 10 years, 57.1 % had fewer than 100 employees, and 65.7 % were privately or collectively owned. Measures Two independent bilingual professors translated the entire survey from English into Chinese and then back-translated it into English to ensure equivalence of meaning (Brislin, 1980). All scales adopted the 5-point Likert-type response format. We asked respondents to choose an answer that best represented their beliefs and attitudes. social Corporate responsibility We used the 13-item scale developed by Singhapakdi, Vitell, Rallapalli, and Kraft (1996) to measure the perceptions of top management toward CSR (ranging from 1 = totally disagree, to 5 = totally agree; sample items include “Social responsibility and profitability can be compatible,” “Being ethical and socially responsible is the most important thing a firm can do,” and “Business has a social responsibility beyond making a profit”). The scale has been widely validated and used in the management literature and has been shown to have sound psychometric properties (see, e.g., Etheredge, 1999; Shafer, Fukukawa, & Lee, 2007). The scale’s alpha reliability in this study was .71. Ethical leadership We used the 15-item scale developed by Resick et al. (2006) to measure general manager’s ethical leadership (such as “Trust,” “Communicative,” and “Morale Booster”). Resick et al.’s (2006) scale has been validated across 31 different societies including China and used in various studies (Martin, Resick, Keating, & Dickson, 2009). We asked the vice-general managers to indicate to what extent they agreed (ranging from 1 = totally disagree, to 5 = totally agree) with each statement regarding their immediate supervisors (general managers). The scale’s alpha reliability in this study was .96. Firm reputation We used the well-known Fortune criteria to measure firm reputation. The 8-item scale (ranging from 1 = very poor, to 5 = very good) includes innovativeness, quality of management, value as a long-term investment, community and environmental responsibility, ability to attract and retain talented people, quality of products and services, financial soundness, and the wise use of corporate assets. This kind of published ranking measures the reputation of corporations among particular stakeholder groups, such as business leaders (Wry, Deephouse, & McNamara, 2006). Academics often use the Fortune survey in testing links between firm reputation and other financial or strategic variables, such as CSR (Chun, 2005). From the list of the “World’s Most Admired Companies” issued annually by Fortune magazine, we can see that Fortune started merging both US and non-US companies to create a global ranking a few years ago. Indeed, the Fortune items appear to be applicable to the Chinese context. The scale’s alpha reliability in this study was .91. Firm performance We operationalized firm performance using accounting measures, including return on investment (ROI), return on equity (ROE), return on sales (ROS), and growth in sales in the same year as the action measure. The measures (ranging from 1 = Corporate social responsibility 935 within last 20 %, to 5 = within first 20 %) were derived from questions asking respondents to assess firm performance relative to the performance of industry competitors. Research has shown that measures of perceived firm performance are positively correlated with objective measures of firm performance (Dollinger & Golden, 1992; Powell, 1992). We used accounting measures in this study because they are regarded as a standard means of assessing relative financial performance, and are more widely acceptable and less likely to produce ambiguity than other measures (Aupperle et al., 1985; Chow, Teo, & Chew, 2013; Wang, Jiang, Yuan, & Yi, 2013). The scale’s alpha reliability in this study was .91. Control variables To rule out alternative explanations for our findings, we controlled for three variables; the age of the organization, its size, and ownership type. Studies show that age and size (Kanter, 1984; Pinchot, 1985), and ownership type (Law, Tse, & Zhou, 2003) may influence performance. For the selection of our control variables, we followed the approach of other studies conducted in emerging markets, such as China, India, Indonesia, and Mexico (e.g., Mishra & Suar, 2010; Muller & Kolk, 2009; Rahmawati & Dianita, 2011; Wang, Qiu, & Kong, 2011). We calculated age as the number of years between the establishment of the firm and the date the survey was completed. We defined size by the number of employees. We classified ownership into four types; state-owned, privately or collectively owned, joint venture, and totally foreign owned. Data analysis the product are We used bootstrap analysis (Efron & Tibshirani, 1993) to test for a conditional indirect effect (MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, & Sheets, 2002). Bootstrapping is used mainly because the usual Sobel’s test is based on normality assumption of the indirect effects (i.e., a x b). This assumption is tenuous because the distribution of a product is non-normal, even when the variables constituting 1984). Bootstrapping is a nonparametric method based on resampling with replacement which is done many times, such as 1,000. From each of these samples the indirect effect is computed and a sampling distribution can be empirically generated. If the 95 % confidence interval excluded 0, the indirect effect being tested was declared statistically significant (Efron & Tibshirani, 1993). Following procedures suggested by Shrout and Bolger (2002), we bootstrapped 5,000 samples and used the bootstrap estimates to construct bias-corrected confidence intervals for all significance tests reported in this study. (Anderson, distributed normally We tested for the chain moderated mediation model by estimating three sets of equations: M1 ¼ a0 þ a1X þ r1 Y1 M2ð Þ ¼ b0 þ b1X þ b2M1 þ b3XM1 þ r2 Y2 ¼ c0 þ c1M1 þ c2M2 þ r3 ð1Þ ð2Þ ð3Þ 936 Y. Zhu et al. Using Eqs. 1 and 2, we tested whether ethical leadership (X) functions as a moderator of the path from CSR (M1) to firm reputation (Y1) as well as an independent variable. The strength of an indirect effect may depend on the level of CSR (H5). Using Eqs. 2 and 3, we tested whether the indirect effect of CSR (M1) on firm performance (Y2) via firm reputation (M2) is contingent upon ethical leadership (X) (H6). Thought it was not in our hypotheses, we further tested overall conditional indirect effect of ethical leadership. Specifically, we tested whether ethical leadership moderated its indirect effect on firm performance sequentially through CSR and reputation. We reported the result after the test of six hypotheses. Results Table 1 presents the results of the descriptive statistics, correlations, and scale reliabilities for the variables in this study. As can be seen from the table, ethical leadership was positively related to CSR (r = .55, p < .01). CSR was positively related to firm reputation (r = .35, p < .01), but not to firm performance (r = .11, n.s.). Firm reputation was positively related to firm performance (r = .52, p < .01). Table 2 presents the regression results of the test of the direct and chain moderated mediation effects. As shown in Model 1, ethical leadership was positively related to CSR (b = .34, se. = .04, p < .001). Thus, H1 is supported. In Model 2, however, CSR was only marginally related to firm reputation (b = .19, se. = .12, p < .10). Thus, H2 is rejected. In Model 3, firm reputation was positively related to firm performance (b = .76, se. = .09, p < .001). Thus, H3 is supported. In Model 2, the interaction term of ethical leadership and CSR was significantly related to firm reputation (b = .39, se. = .13, p < .01). When ethical related to firm reputation (b = −.08, se. = .13, n.s.). When ethical leadership was strong, CSR was positively related to firm reputation (b = .47, se. = .16, p < .001). Thus, H4 is supported. To further examine whether the form of the interaction term conformed leadership was weak, CSR was not Table 1 Descriptive statistics, correlations, and reliabilities Variables Mean s.d. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1.

Figure 2 depicts the plot of this significant interaction term. In support of H4, under strong ethical leadership, CSR was positively related to firm reputation, while under weak ethical leadership, the two were not related. Given the significant interaction effect reported above, we further tested H5 (the indirect effect of ethical leadership on firm reputation via CSR) and H6 (the indirect effect of CSR on firm performance via firm reputation) by estimating the conditional indirect effects at low and high values of ethical leadership. Table 3(1) displays these effects on firm reputation. As can be seen, at low levels of ethical leadership, there was no indirect effect on firm reputation via CSR (b = −.03, se. = .05, 95 % CI [−.117, .065]). However, at a high level of ethical leadership, there was a significant indirect effect on firm reputation via CSR (b = .16, se. = .06, 95 % CI [.050, .295]). Thus, we can observe the indirect and positive effect of ethical leadership on firm reputation through CSR when such leadership was strong but not when it was weak. H5 is thus supported. 2 Interactive Fig. ethical leadership and CSR on firm reputation effect of Firm Reputation  High ethical leadership Low ethical leadership Low CSR                                                  High CSR 938 Y.

As shown, at a low level of ethical leadership, there was no indirect effect on firm reputation via CSR (b = −.06, se. = .10, 95 % CI [−.260, .142]). However, at a high level, there was a significant indirect effect on firm reputation via CSR (b = .36, se. = .14, 95 % CI [.100, .664]). Thus, we can observe the indirect and positive effect of CSR on firm performance through firm reputation when ethical leadership was strong but not when it was weak. H6 is thus supported Figures 3 and 4 depict the plot of the conditional indirect effects, with an accompanying 95% confidence band, in support of H5 and H6. The result of overall conditional indirect effect suggested that the indirect effect of ethical leadership did not moderate its indirect effect on firm performance through CSR and firm reputation when leaders displayed strong, but not weak ethical leadership.

We observed such an indirect and positive effect when ethical leadership was strong but not when it was weak. Our discussion now addresses the implications of our work for theory, research, and practice. Theoretical implications implications are discernible from this study. First, Three theoretical this study empirically examines the impact of ethical leadership on CSR engagement at the firm level. On the one hand, this study responds to the call for exploring the role of leadership in promoting the ideals of CSR (Strand, 2011), advancing the line of research on the role of ethical leadership in determining CSR activities. On the other hand, this study addresses a gap in the ethical leadership literature by examining CSR as a positive outcome of ethical leadership at the firm level (Mayer et al., 2012; Walumbwa et al., 2011). This study serves as foundation for further explorations into the effect of ethical leadership on socially responsible behaviors at the firm level. Second, this study provides support for the stakeholder theory. According to this approach, when a firm seeks to serve the interests of its shareholders only, its success in doing so is likely to be affected by other stakeholders (such as customers, employees, and suppliers; Foster & Jonker, 2005; Wong, Ormiston, & Tetlock, 2011). Alternatively, it may be said that the interests of shareholders cannot be met without satisfying, to a certain degree, the needs of other stakeholders. The inclusive stakeholder approach makes commercial sense, allowing the firm to maximize shareholder wealth while increasing the total value added (Phillips et al., 2003). Socially responsible top executives must identify the issues faced by various stakeholder groups; seek possible solutions; consider the pros, cons, and tradeoffs that accompany each solution; and finally select and implement a solution that satisfies the interests of multiple stakeholders. Following this perspective, this study extends the current research on the mechanism through which CSR affects firm performance. The inconsistent findings regarding the effect of CSR on firm performance means there is a need for researchers to understand why and how this happens. The results of our study suggest that ethical leadership moderates the 940 Y. Zhu et al. indirect effect of CSR on firm performance via firm reputation. CSR has a strong indirect effect on firm performance when leaders display strong ethical leadership, but not when this is weak. The investigation of the mediating role of firm reputation contributes to our understanding of why CSR influences firm performance, and also identifies possible mechanisms for how it does so. A leadership approach to ethics not only confers the legitimacy and sustainability necessary to achieve business success, but also serves as an effective way to implement socially responsible activities in an organization (Sama & Shoaf, 2008). Indeed, our study is a response to the call for research on CSR and firm performance which moves from exploring bivariate relationships to a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship. This study is one of the first to examine the role of ethical leadership in a model in which CSR influences firm performance. Third, our findings verify the generalizability of the impact of CSR in a non- Western cultural context. Prior studies in this field have primarily been conducted in the context of Western developed markets, where there are strong institutions and appeal systems that support CSR practices. Studies on CSR and its impact on firm performance have only recently appeared in China (e.g., Chen & Wang, 2011; Wang & Qian, 2011; Ye & Zhang, 2011). Although China still lags behind its Western counterparts in terms of CSR, Chinese firms have made some significant and positive progress in this area in recent years (Tsoi, 2010). This study provides insight into the integration of ethical leadership and CSR, and its implications for performance in Chinese firms. Practical implications Our study has implications for managers, particularly in China, in terms of how and where efforts to promote CSR should be concentrated so as to enhance firm performance. Managers in other countries and regions with similar cultural and social norms could use our results to devise a roadmap for the development of their CSR strategies and initiatives (Karam et al., 2013). Specifically, the current study has three practical their organizations and stakeholder groups. Ethical leaders devote their time and energy to instilling their own ethics and values into the corporate culture. It is crucial for them to tell a compelling and morally rich story, and to bring it to life by making a strong commitment to ethical values and acting as a role model of socially responsible behavior. leaders are first and foremost members of implications. First, Second, the results indicate that strong ethical leadership provides the context within which a company’s CSR practices create a more positive reputation among stakeholders, which ultimately enhances firm performance. As suggested by Drucker (1974), an organization high “in spirit of performance” is one whose leaders possess integrity and serve the common good. Strong ethical leadership is likely to reveal itself in the manner in which leaders refuse to compromise ethical standards in the pursuit of organizational performance. Ethical leaders commit themselves to setting high ethical standards and acting in accordance with them. Consistent with high ethical principles such as honesty, fairness, and trustworthiness, leaders not only take responsibility for their own actions, but also use rewards and punishments appropriately to hold subordinates responsible for their actions (Brown & Treviño, Corporate social responsibility 941 2006). In the leadership literature, integrity is seen as a fundamental prerequisite (Drucker, 1974; Simons, 2002). The perception that a leader has integrity has been shown to lead to positive effects, such as trust (Simons, 2002) and an ethical organizational culture (Brown & Treviño, 2006). Thus, leaders must realize that they play a critical role in creating, sustaining, or changing all aspects of an ethical working environment and climate. They should serve as role models who have integrity and credibility by engaging in normatively appropriate conduct and making their ethical message salient. Third, this study has direct practical implications for top managers in Chinese firms. As a fast-growing emerging economy, organization policies in China are increasingly driven by social and environmental concerns. While China is now integrating into world economy, there is a growing demand and pressure to meet international standards of business ethics and socially responsible practices. It is imperative for Chinese firms to strengthen their awareness of CSR and actively meet their social responsibilities. The results of this study indicate that CSR engagement has a positive indirect effect on firm performance. Consequently, improved performance can bring various benefits to the company and the community, such as positive publicity, enhanced staff commitment, and greater satisfaction of customer needs (Sheldon, Knox, & Lowry, 2005). Hence, Chinese managers should exercise their ethical duties and responsibilities by taking stakeholder interests into account, which in the long term will help their organization gain and sustain a competitive advantage. Limitations and directions for future research This study has several limitations which provide avenues for future research. First, in examining the impact of CSR on firm performance, this study primarily focuses on the advantages that CSR has brought, but neglect the potential costs of CSR that might decrease firm performance. However, companies can use CSR to produce direct benefits for the bottom line. CSR can be viewed as a form of investment or business strategy to differentiate a corporation and its goods and services. Differentiation will allow the firm to command a premium price or premium market share for its product over the competition. McWilliams and Siegel (2001: 119) purported that “CSR may be a popular means of achieving differentiation, because it allows ethical leaders to simultaneously satisfy personal interests and to achieve product differentiation” which favorably influences firm performance. Ethical leaders may tend to regard CSR in the same way as making business investment decisions, that is, to assess the costs as well as anticipated benefits and related revenues that the business will bring. A systematic approach to CSR investment is therefore likely to yield the most positive results because ethical leaders are likely to make investment decisions which demonstrate the most efficient allocation of resources from the perspective of both the firm and society. Hence, it is possible that the benefits of investing in CSR outweigh the cost in the long run. Second, since we obtained data on all the variables from high-level managers only, there is a possibility of bias. Data obtained directly from senior managers would clearly be a preferable approach for assessing their attitudes and perceptions toward CSR issues and their leadership orientation with regard to ethical issues. It would be 942 Y. Zhu et al. useful for future studies to use multiple types of data from other stakeholder groups, such as employees and customers. Third, quantitative research such as this does have disadvantages. For example, the categories and theories used, as identified by the researcher, might not fully capture the respondents’ understanding, and/or might reflect the views of the researcher instead of the participants or objective measures. Therefore, it would be advantageous for future research to incorporate other approaches. Take firm performance as an example. We used a subjective measure of firm performance. Though subjective firm performance ratings have positive correlations with objective measures (Dess & Robinson, 1984), it would be desirable to replicate our study using the latter. Take CSR as another example. CSR in this study is treated as a perceptual construct (e.g., measuring “beliefs” statement about doing good for the society), rather than a “behavioral” construct (which measures the actual behavior of the firm). Although researchers recognize the challenge of developing comprehensive CSR measures that can address social performance, there is a tendency to rely on different stakeholders’ areas to assess CSR performance in the literature (Carroll, 2000). The argument is “if we do less than this, we should not call it social performance” (Carroll, 2000: 474). Despite the apparent risk of applying CSR as a behavioral construct, stakeholders’ views can be a more reliable way of measuring CSR compared to alternative methods. Hence, we stick to the stakeholder theory to measure CSR, as it tends to seek consistency with potentially divergent interests, meeting the discretionary responsibilities imposed on the organizations by the stakeholders. Further, CSR appears to be more of a public relations exercise to appear good in the society. There is a strong, inherent social desirability that can produce spurious relationships and thus hide the true relationships between variables (Ganster, Hennessey & Luthans, 1983). Social desirability constitutes one of potential sources of common method bias (Podsakoff, Mackenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003). To control common method bias, we use different sources for different measures and collect data from two points of time. We tested moderated and moderated indirect effect among variables in this study. Common method bias has been suggested to be less of an issue in moderated regression (Evans, 1985). For these reasons, the results in this study are subjective and not attributable to common method bias. Finally, this study was restricted to one geographic region in China, which may limit the generalizability of our findings. To enhance their external validity, we encourage similar investigations in other regions or countries. On the other hand, future research design should include samples from multiple countries so that relatively universal boundary conditions/domains can be identified (Liden, 2012). Conclusion leadership. This study highlights ethical This study sought to explain why and how CSR enhances firm performance. This study examined the antecedents and outcomes of CSR and the moderating role of ethical leadership as an important determinant of CSR which also has a contingent role in the relationships between CSR, firm reputation, and firm performance. Our study adds value to the CSR literature. Corporate social responsibility 943 References Aiken, L. S., & West, S. G. 1991. Multiple regression: Testing and interpreting interactions.
