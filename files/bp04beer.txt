Volume 13 Numbers 2/3 April/July 2004 Voluntary social disclosures by large UK companies Stephen Brammerand Stephen Pavelinn Introduction An extensive conceptual literature that examines the motives for, and consequences of, ﬁrms making voluntary disclosures, emphasises the signiﬁcance of legal, competitive, strategic, and ﬁnancial factors (Grossman 1981, Milgrom 1981, Verrecchia 1983, Trueman 1997, Hughes & Sankar 1997, Evans & Sridhar 2002), and distinguishes between various types of voluntary disclosure, according to both their subject (e.g. earnings and/or sales forecasts, corporate govern- ance and changes in senior management, and social and environmental policies or performance) and the media through which such disclosures are made (e.g. Lang & Lundholm 1993, 2000, Skinner 1994, Soffer et al. 2000, Baginski et al. 2002, Cullen & Christopher 2002, Miller 2002, Cormier & Magnan 2003, Hutton et al. 2003, Sinclair- Desgagne´ & Gozlan 2003). The increased interest in corporate social responsibility (CSR) among consumers, investors, employees, creditors, legislators, and regulators has coincided with the growing incidence and sophistication of corporate social reporting (Gray et al. 1995, Deegan et al. 2000). The majority of large businesses volunteer information concerning the impact of their activities on society and the manner in which these impacts are managed within the ﬁrm (Gray et al. 1995, 2001, Hackston & Milne 1996, Deegan & Gordon 1996). In response, a number of empirical studies analyse nRespectively, Lecturer, School of Management, University of Bath; and Lecturer, Department of Economics, University of Reading Business School. the pattern of voluntary social disclosure, many of which examine either the incidence or content of corporate annual reports and/or separate social, environmental, and employee health and safety reports (e.g. Guthrie & Parker 1989, Gray et al. 1995, Robertson & Nicholson 1996, Hackston & Milne 1996, Patten 2002a). Gray et al. (1995) provide a comprehensive review of the literature on ﬁrms’ social and environmental disclosures and classify existing theoretical contributions into three groups: those focusing on decision-usefulness explanations; those drawing on economic theory; and those based on socio-political theories. These share common ground in that they all suggest that social disclosures are a signiﬁcant strategic tool in the management of relationships between the company and stakeholder groups. According to the decision-usefulness approach, corporate dis- closures are attempts to remove informational asymmetries between the ﬁrm and external agents, primarily agents in the investment community. Empirical work that subscribes to this view most commonly attempts impact disclosures have on stock prices (e.g. Shane & Spicer 1983), but with broadly inconclusive results. Economic approaches propose that social disclosures are pre-emptive steps to mitigate adverse regulatory or legislative pressures in the future. Managers are motivated to make disclo- sures of this kind because the failure to do so may reduce their discretion over future investment opportunities (Watts & Zimmermann 1978, Shane & Spicer 1983). The socio-political approaches are those ‘set within a framework of assumptions about ‘political economy’’ (Gray et al. 1995: 52). to evaluate the 86 r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004. 9600 Garsington Road, Oxford OX4 2DQ, UK and 350 Main St, Malden, MA 02148, USA. Business Ethics: A European Review Encompassing stakeholder theory, this approach interprets social disclosure as a tool for inﬂuen- cing the perceptions and actions of social and political stakeholders. An empirical literature documents the variation across ﬁrms in social disclosure activities. It is shown to vary across companies, countries, industries, and time (e.g. Patten 1991, Gray et al. 1995, 2001, Hackston & Milne 1996). Furthermore, there is some evidence that patterns in social disclosure are systematically related to ﬁrm and industry characteristics (e.g. Belkaoui & Karpik 1989, Hackston & Milne 1996, Patten 2002a, 2002b, Cormier & Magnan 2003). Existing evidence regarding the incidence of voluntary social disclosures suffers from a number of well- known limitations (Ullmann 1985, Patten 2002a) that contribute to the inconclusiveness of existing ﬁndings (Ullmann 1985, Gray et al. 2001). For example, the samples analysed in earlier studies have tended to be small, and to be restricted in diversity in both the size of the companies and their industrial composition. Speciﬁcally, empiri- cal work has typically focused upon only the very largest companies (e.g. Guthrie & Parker 1989, Gray et al. 1995, 2001, Clarke & Gibson-Sweet 1999), or only those industries identiﬁed as particularly environmentally sensitive (e.g. In- gram & Frazier 1980, Freedman & Jaggi 1988). In spite of the recognition that ﬁrms use multiple media in providing information concerning their social the existing literature has focused exclusively on disclosures made in corporate annual reports (Zeghal and Ahmed 1990). In consequence, few studies have investigated the propensity for ﬁrms to make multiple social disclosures, potentially through a variety of different media. impacts to stakeholders, much of This paper examines patterns in the voluntary social disclosures made by a sample of large UK companies. Before moving on, we would like to draw attention to some notable aspects of our analysis. First, we describe each ﬁrm’s behaviour regarding a set of voluntary disclosure opportu- nities. Numerous studies have dealt with a sample of ﬁrms’ decisions to participate in a single disclosure, for example, adoption of an environ- mental standard, production of an annual report (e.g. Gray et al. 1995, Clarke & Gibson-Sweet 1999, Khanna & Damon 1999). In contrast, our methodology permits us to inspect a ﬁrm’s overall social disclosure strategy across a number of opportunities. Second, in contrast to much of the literature on social disclosure, we focus upon social disclosure made through a variety of media. We analyse ﬁrm disclosures made not only through corporate annual reports, but also those associated with participation in social respon- siveness surveys. We do so because the latter represents a distinctive form of disclosure, as the ﬁrm does not retain the editorial control it enjoys when producing its own publications. Indeed, since several forms of corporate disclosure under consideration are subject to independent valida- tion, disclosure exerts a considerable administra- tive burden upon the ﬁrm.1 Third, we marry data on participation in voluntary social disclosure with data on ﬁrm size, media visibility, nature of activities, and external measures of ﬁrm social performance. This permits the identiﬁcation of systematic differences in ﬁrm attributes between disclosers and non-disclosers. The paper is structured as follows. The next section discusses the motivations for voluntary social disclosure from the perspective of stake- holder theory. Following that, in a section, we introduce the methodology including the sample, data sources and variable deﬁnitions. Description differences in the attributes of disclosers and non-disclosers ensues in a section and the section to this analyses the variability of subsequent industries. The penultimate disclosure across section discusses the tendency for ﬁrms to engage in multiple disclosures. A ﬁnal section concludes. Motivations for social disclosure Voluntary social disclosure reduces the informa- tional asymmetries between the ﬁrm and external stakeholders, primarily those in the investment regarding corporate policies and community, performance. Recent history highlights some notable instances where social irresponsibility has had a detrimental effect on the ﬁnancial r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004 87 Volume 13 Numbers 2/3 April/July 2004 the ﬁrm in question. Given the health of possibility of hidden corporate attributes, inves- tors may prefer not to invest in companies that fail to volunteer information concerning their social performance. The point is that, in the absence of disclosure, ‘investors will assume the worst and . . . bid down its stock price’ (Cormier & Magnan 2003: 47). In that sense, voluntary disclosures may be viewed as attempts to reduce the information risks faced by potential and actual investors. However, not all ﬁrms choose to make social disclosures, and those that do, adopt disclosure policies of varying breadth.2 This is because disclosure is costly. It can impose the costs of measuring and verifying social impacts, as well as the administrative burden of collating and pub- lishing such information (Verrecchia 1983, Li et al. 1997, Cormier & Magnan 1999). Therefore, one would expect the extent of disclosure activity to be determined by the relative costs and beneﬁts of disclosing such information (Li et al. 1997, Cormier & Magnan 1999, 2003). The existing literature demonstrates these costs and beneﬁts vary with pressure from external agents such as legislators, regulators, community and environmental lobby groups, consumers and socially responsible investors (Roberts 1992, Li et al. 1997, Sinclair-Desgagne´ & Gozlan 2003, Willis 2003), the ﬁrm’s vulnerability to those pressures as captured by its size and media visibility (Roberts 1992, Patten 2002b, Cormier & Magnan 2003), its environmental performance (Ullmann 1985, Patten 2002), its ownership and governance structures (Roberts 1992, Cullen & Christopher 2002, Cormier & Magnan 2003), and resource availability (Roberts 1992, Cormier & Magnan 2003). that Social and political approaches such as legiti- macy theory and stakeholder theory have become the dominant conceptual approaches within the social disclosure literature (Gray et al. 1995, Deegan et al. 2000). Within the stakeholder view, implicit contracts exist between society and corporations such that society’s willingness to sanction the economic activities of businesses is contingent upon their operation ‘within the bounds and norms of society’ (Brown & Deegan 1998: 22). Social disclosure provides a means by which corporations can ‘demonstrate that [their] actions are legitimate and that [they have] behaved as good corporate citizens’ (Hooghiem- stra 2000: 56). Hence, stakeholder theory views social disclo- sure as a response to signiﬁcant pressures from a ﬁrm’s external environment. Apart from the investment community, such pressures may arise from pressure groups (Tilt 1994) or the general public (Neu et al. 1998), and may be speciﬁc to those industries where particular issues arise (Patten 1992). For example, an extensive litera- ture argues that industries have inherently differ- ent environmental impacts (e.g. Halme & Huse 1996). Industries with a high environmental impact are characterised by their association with highly visible environmental issues (Bowen 2000) such as global warming and the risk of oil spills. The activities of ﬁrms in these industries are subject to intense scrutiny from environmental stakeholders. Earlier empirical work has identiﬁed a number of sectors as having high environmental impacts, e.g. the metals, resources, paper and pulp, power generation, water, and chemicals sectors (Morris 1997, Sharma 1997, Hoffman 1999, Sharma et al. 1999, Bowen 2000, Clemens 2001). In contrast, other industries, particularly newer manufacturing industries and the service sector, have signiﬁcantly lower environmental impacts and are associated with fewer highly visible environmental issues. The tobacco and alcoholic drinks industries are associated with highly visible social issues. They are thought to produce large social externalities (e.g. crime and health) and are subject to strong regulatory regimes (competition, safety and taxa- tion). Similarly, the defence and pharmaceutical industries are subject to considerable pressure from ethical pressure groups. In the case of pharmaceutical companies, this reﬂects concern over pricing and distribution policies in advanced and developing countries3 and ethical concerns over experimental techniques (e.g. animal rights issues). Aside from a ﬁrm’s association with a particu- lar industrial activity, the willingness to make social disclosures would be it is expected that 88 r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004 Business Ethics: A European Review If, as studies some earlier inﬂuenced by that ﬁrm’s record of social perfor- mance. suggest, voluntary social disclosure is contingent upon a ﬁrm’s social performance, this implies a will- ingness ‘to report ‘‘good news’’ but [reluctance] to report ‘‘bad news’’,’ and characterises disclosure as, ‘to a large extent self-laudatory’ (Hooghiem- stra 2000: 57). However, the evidence concerning such a relationship is very mixed (Ullmann 1985). From a stakeholder perspective, one would expect a positive association between social performance and social disclosure. After all, it is only those ﬁrms that have fulﬁlled their implicit contract with society that are in a position to demonstrate that fact through disclosure. Organisational size and visibility are commonly proposed as ﬁrm-level drivers of voluntary disclosure (Hackston & Milne 1996, Cormier & Magnan 2003). Indeed, several studies provide evidence of a positive relationship between ﬁrm size and disclosure activism (e.g. Cowen et al. 1987, Roberts 1992, Patten 2002a). Large ﬁrms tend to be more visible to relevant publics and so tend to be subject to greater political and regulatory pressure from external interests (Belk- aoui & Karpik 1989, Brown & Deegan 1998). Furthermore, Cowen et al. (1987) argue that larger organisations are more likely to use formal channels of communication (such as disclosures in annual reports or other corporate documentation) in order to disseminate information concerning corporate activities. However, organisational visibility is not solely determined by organisational size. Consistent with this, much of the recent disclosure literature emphasises the importance of media exposure (Brown & Deegan 1998, Patten 2002a) in deter- mining the nature and context of the relationship between companies and their stakeholders (Brown & Deegan 1998, Adler & Milne 1997). Media coverage ‘inﬂuences the preferences of the popu- lace and helps set the public agenda’ which, ‘in turn generates constituency pressure’ (Erﬂe & McMillan 1990: 123). This that greater media exposure tends to bring greater pressure from social and political stakeholders, and so, one would expect, makes more pressing the need to provide information regarding social responsiveness. implies To summarise, the stakeholder perspective proposes that the motivation to make a voluntary social disclosure varies systematically across industries and ﬁrms. We would expect disclosure to be positively related to ﬁrm size, media ex- posure, and social performance, and to be more common in industries that suffer a perceived association with social issues and concerns. Method Our sample consists of 134 of the largest (by the value of total assets) 150 publicly listed UK companies4 in 2001. This approach (i.e. sampling the largest companies) is adopted in much of the empirical literature on social disclosure (e.g. Guthrie & Parker 1989, Gray et al. 1995, Clarke & Gibson-Sweet 1999). Therefore, our sampling strategy promotes comparability between this and previous work. Firms that make voluntary disclosures tend to be large, and some of the motivations for engaging in disclosure may apply only to larger companies. For example, Adler & Milne (1997) ﬁnd evidence of a size threshold effect in the relationship between ﬁrm exposure and social disclosure. Nevertheless, large ﬁrms still tend to exhibit sufﬁcient diversity of practice to generate an ideal test bed for the study of the motivations for social disclosure (Gray et al. 1995). Data on voluntary disclosures We utilise data on the ﬁrms’ participation, or otherwise, in ﬁve forms of voluntary social disclosure:  Business in the Environment (BiE) Corporate Environmental Engagement Index 2002;  Business in the Community (BitC) Corporate Responsibility Index 2002;  Environmental disclosure in 2002 annual reports;  Community/Social disclosure in 2002 annual reports;  Employee/Health and Safety disclosure in 2002 annual reports. r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004 89 Volume 13 Numbers 2/3 April/July 2004 BitC is a, ‘unique movement in the UK of 700 member companies’ whose ‘purpose is to inspire, challenge, engage and support business in con- tinually improving its impact on society’ (BitC 2003: 1). Participation in the Corporate Respon- sibility Index requires that companies complete a survey detailing their management of, and per- formance in, various dimensions of social respon- siveness (e.g. product safety, occupational health and safety, community investment, and environ- mental impact). Submissions must be signed-off at the board level, and a BitC inspectorate randomly tests their validity. The resulting publication reports the relative performance of each ﬁrm. BiE is a ‘business-led campaign for corporate environmental responsibility’. Their ‘aim is to inspire companies towards improving the impact they have on the environment, while gaining competitive advantage through their approach to sustainable development’ (BiE 2001: 3). The BiE employs the same methodology as the BitC when gathering and publishing information. For each ﬁrm, its pattern of environmental, community/social and employee/health and safety disclosures in annual reports was obtained from the Corporate Register database, a directory of published corporate environmental and social reports. Developed as an information tool for stakeholders in the ﬁeld of environmental and social reporting, Corporate Register classiﬁes the disclosures of UK plcs by analysing the content of annual reports (including any separate social, environmental and health and safety reports). They make qualitative judgements as to whether or not organisations have made disclosures on a given theme. In doing so, they exclude ‘sales brochures, [reports that] have no reference year, no hard data and no statement of policy, [and] sections from annual reports [shorter than] six pages, regardless of whether the issuing company terms them a ‘report’ (CorporateRegister.com). This approach is to that typically adopted elsewhere in the literature, which focuses on the number of words or sentences in, or the proportion of, the annual report devoted to social information (e.g. Guthrie & Parker 1989, Hackston & Milne 1996). In addition, the deﬁnition embodies signals of the somewhat similar quality of disclosures such as the presence of quantiﬁed impacts and improvements and poli- cies. Corporate Register also classiﬁes disclosures, thus deﬁned, according to their type.5 For our sample ﬁrms, we extract from the database, whether, in 2002, the ﬁrm made any environ- mental disclosures, community/social disclosures, or employee/health and safety disclosures.6 These ﬁve forms of social disclosure were chosen for several reasons. First, they offer a mixture of the speciﬁc and the general. Some disclosures concern speciﬁc elements of social responsibility, such as environmental responsibil- ity (the BiE survey and environmental annual reporting), community responsibility (commu- nity/social annual reporting), and employee re- sponsibility (employee/health and safety annual reporting). Another is more general (the BitC survey). Note that all of these voluntary disclo- sure opportunities were available to our entire sample of ﬁrms. Secondly, the disclosures are made through a variety of media. The ﬁrst two (as listed above) are made via responses to surveys; the latter three are the product of internal reporting systems. One difference between these two groups lies in the degree of administrative burden and editorial control. One would expect both to be greater for the latter group. Data on other ﬁrm characteristics A measure of each ﬁrm’s size (the value of total assets), and principal activity (approximately equivalent to the three-digit NACE industry) were extracted from accounting data courtesy of DataStream. Our measure of media exposure is derived from the Factiva database, which provides searchable archives of news content from over 8000 global sources. We gathered data for each of the calendar years 1998–2002 inclusive, and used the natural logarithm of the average number of annual news hits as our measure of corporate visibility. Finally, social performance data were obtained from the Ethical Investment Research Service (EIRIS). EIRIS survey ﬁrms, but they also undertake their own research. As a result, they are able to provide social performance scores for a 90 r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004 Business Ethics: A European Review ﬁrm irrespective of whether it participates in an EIRIS survey. They offer the largest and most complete multidimensional social performance coverage of UK ﬁrms, covering issues relating to employment, the environment, community, hu- man rights, and supply chain management. Due to the limited availability of data regarding the last two of these, we will restrict our attention to the ﬁrst three dimensions of social performance.  Employment: health and safety; training and development; equal opportunities; employee relations; job creation; and job security. Each category graded7 1–3. Employment responsi- bility score out of 18 (Cronbach’s a of 0.88).  Environment: policies; systems; reporting; and performance. Each category graded 1–5. En- vironmental impact score out of 20 (Cron- bach’s a of 0.85).  Community engagement score graded 1–4. To arrive at a single aggregate measure (the Overall Social Responsibility score) we summed the three scores, having normalised each to a 1–4 grading. This generates an overall score out of 12, with a Cronbach’s a of 0.92. Firm characteristics and voluntary social disclosure This section compares the characteristics of ﬁrms that make a range of social disclosures with those of ﬁrms that do not. Earlier, we identiﬁed several themes that have emerged from the existing literature. These include relationships between the propensity to make voluntary social disclo- sures and ﬁrm size, media exposure, and social performance. Table 1 provides means for these three ﬁrm characteristics while making a distinc- tion between disclosers and non-disclosers for each of the ﬁve disclosure opportunities. The ﬁndings indicate that, on average, disclo- sers are larger than non-disclosers. This difference is highly statistically signiﬁcant for 3 of the 5 disclosure opportunities: the BiE Index of Envir- onmental Engagement ( p 5 0.000), and the dis- closure of environmental and social/community information in annual reports ( p 5 0.000 and 0.037, respectively). In addition, our ﬁndings indicate that the ﬁrms that disclose have higher levels of media exposure than those that do not. This difference is highly statistically signiﬁcant (at the 5% level or better) for all 5 disclosures. Consistent with previous studies, these ﬁndings suggest that large and highly visible ﬁrms face greater external pressure, and may therefore make voluntary social disclosures to effectively manage their relationships with stakeholders. Evidence from previous studies regarding the link between social performance and social disclosure is rather ambiguous (Ullmann 1985). However, for all ﬁve disclosure opportunities, we ﬁnd disclosers have better social performance than do non-disclosers. Indeed, these differences are all statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level or better. Consistent with some earlier evidence, these ﬁndings suggest a tendency for voluntary disclosures to be used by ﬁrms to communicate their good social performance to relevant stake- holder constituencies. Voluntary disclosure by industry from around 10% for annual Table 2 presents the rates of disclosure among sample ﬁrms by industrial sector. These rates vary considerably across the ﬁve disclosure opportu- nities, report disclosures concerning employee health and safety to over 76% for the BiE index of environmental engagement. That disclosures relating to environ- mental impact are more numerous may reﬂect the relatively long-lived signiﬁcance of such issues in the UK, and/or the comparative maturity of the BiE index itself.8 Consistent with stakeholder theory and with earlier empirical evidence (e.g. Clarke & Gibson-Sweet 1999), the rate of participation in the different forms of voluntary disclosure varies signiﬁcantly across industries. The cross-industry pattern of participation in the two environmentally focused disclosures (the BiE index of Environmental Engagement and environmental disclosure in annual reports) is very similar. In particular, the proportion of ﬁrms making such disclosures is highest among r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004 91 Volume 13 Numbers 2/3 April/July 2004 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . - n o N s r e s o l c s i D - n o N s r e s o l c s i D - n o N s r e s o l c s i D - n o N s r e s o l c s i D - n o N s r e s o l c s i D S & H / e e y o p m E l l a i c o S / y t i n u m m o C n i e r u s o l c s i d t r o p e r l a u n n a n i e r u s o l c s i d t r o p e r l a u n n a l a t n e m n o r i v n E n i e r u s o l c s i d t r o p e r l a u n n a e t a r o p r o C C t i B e t a r o p r o C f o x e d n I i E B y t i l i b i s n o p s e R x e d n I l a t n e m n o r i v n E t n e m e g a g n E e r u s o l c s i D l a i c o S y r a t n u o V l f o e p y T y b s r e s o l c s i d - n o N d n a s r e s o l c s i D f o s c i t s i r e t c a r a h C e g a r e v A : 1 e l b a T s r e s o l c s i d 4 0 5 , 2 2 8 7 5 , 1 9 9 6 , 1 6 5 0 5 , 3 s r e s o l c s i d 5 6 9 , 5 1 4 1 4 , 1 7 5 9 , 7 5 1 4 8 2 s r e s o l c s i d 0 2 8 , 5 1 9 0 3 1 3 9 0 , 0 5 9 9 7 2 s r e s o l c s i d 0 8 1 , 0 2 5 5 0 1 2 6 8 , 3 3 1 4 6 2 1 8 2 , 3 5 8 3 , 6 6 3 5 , 1 6 4 8 9 8 0 4 1 4 1 5 8 8 1 3 2 1 4 1 5 3 8 . 1 2 9 . 5 9 1 . 7 0 0 . 5 1 3 . 2 9 6 . 8 8 3 . 9 7 7 . 6 1 7 . 1 7 3 . 5 1 8 . 6 4 6 . 4 6 3 . 2 0 7 . 8 1 2 . 9 0 8 . 6 0 7 . 1 9 0 . 5 4 8 . 6 3 5 . 4 7 2 . 2 8 6 . 8 8 6 . 8 1 6 . 6 5 6 . 1 0 2 . 5 1 4 . 6 5 4 . 4 5 1 . 2 0 4 . 7 3 6 . 8 6 0 . 6 s r e s o l c s i d 9 6 7 3 5 1 6 8 3 3 5 3 . 1 1 7 . 2 8 5 . 4 2 0 . 3 9 8 0 , 3 3 ) n o i l l i m d ( s t e s s a l a t o T 1 1 1 2 s t i h i a d e m e g a r e v A 9 5 5 4 s n o i t a n o d l e b a t i r a h C 2 0 0 2 – 8 9 9 1 3 0 . 2 ) 0 0 0 d ( y t i n u m m o C 3 2 . 7 t c a p m i l a t n e m n o r i v n E e r o c s t n e m e g a g n e 5 2 . 8 y t i l i i b s n o p s e r e e y o p m E l e t i s o p m o c 2 8 . 5 e t i s o p m o c l i a c o s l l a r e v O l ;

The rate of disclosure was lowest in the IT, construction, telecommunica- tions, other services, and non-banking ﬁnancial sectors, perhaps reﬂecting the lower level of envi- ronmental impact and proximity to consumers among these ﬁrms. In contrast, there is rather less similarity in the pattern of cross-industry variation for the two non-environmental forms of disclosure. Each disclosure is associated with a particular group of industries, few of which are also similarly associated with environmental disclosure. More speciﬁcally, while both employee/health and safety, and community/social reporting are rela- tively highly prevalent in the food, drink and tobacco, utilities, resources and banking sectors, these patterns diverge in other sectors. For example, of the two, only the former is particu- larly associated with the transport and construc- tion sectors, and an above average incidence of only the latter is found in the telecommunications and insurance sectors. Looking across the rows of Table 2 affords an insight into the extent to which the pattern of disclosure varies between sectors. This variability indicates the extent to which ﬁrms in a given sector tend to respond to particular issues, or adopt a blanket approach of disclosure (or non- disclosure). As one would expect from the discussion above, the rate of participation is consistently above average in some sectors, and below average in others. For example, the resources, utilities, and food, drink and tobacco sectors exhibit an above average rate of disclosure in at least four of the ﬁve opportunities. This suggests that, in those sectors, companies adopt a general strategy of disclosure. This perhaps reﬂects these ﬁrms’ close proximity to social and environmental externalities and their associated threats to corporate reputations. In other indus- tries, the rate of voluntary social disclosure is consistently low. For example, ﬁrms from the non-banking ﬁnance, IT and other services sectors exhibit below average rates of disclosure across the board. This could reﬂect an absence of signiﬁcant social and environmental issues, and the accompanying lack of stakeholder pressure to maintain high levels of social performance. Multiple participation in voluntary social disclosures The analysis in the previous section suggests that ﬁrms in some industries appear to have generally higher propensities to make voluntary social disclosures than ﬁrms in other industries. In this section, we examine, in greater detail, whether these disclosure decisions appear to be interde- pendent. As a ﬁrst step, Figure 1 describes the size distribution of the number of voluntary social disclosures made by sample ﬁrms. Figure 1 suggests that there is considerable diversity across ﬁrms in the pattern of voluntary disclosure. Speciﬁcally, 29 ﬁrms make no voluntary disclo- sures, nine ﬁrms make all ﬁve voluntary disclo- sures and the majority of ﬁrms fall somewhere in between. Evidence of the within-ﬁrm interrelatedness of social disclosure decisions,9 is provided by the Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcients for each dis- closure, as reported in Table 3. In every case the coefﬁcients are positive and highly statistically signiﬁcant. This indicates a positive relationship between making one social disclosure and making others. Firms may simply make multiple social dis- closures because they face multiple salient issues Figure 1: The Size Distribution of the Number of Voluntary Social Disclosures Made by Firms 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 None 1 2 3 4 5 94 r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004 Business Ethics: A European Review . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

However, that require responses. However, this view seems to be at odds with our evidence; in particular, that ﬁrms in the retailing and banking sectors (where ﬁrms face few signiﬁcant issues) and the mining, pharmaceutical and utilities sectors (where the CSR landscape is dominated by a particular concern) make multiple social disclosures seem difﬁcult to reconcile with stakeholder theory. there is some evidence that the tendency to make multiple disclosures is driven by ﬁrm size. We ﬁnd that multiple disclosures are overwhelmingly associated with larger ﬁrms. The average value of total assets of the ﬁrms that make 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 disclosures are d3.9bn, d28.7 bn, d15.3 bn, d44.5 bn, d46.2 bn and d85.0 bn, respectively. Also, correlations between ﬁrm size and the number of disclosures yield highly statistically signiﬁcant Pearson and Spearman’s coefﬁcients of 0.395 ( p 5 0.000) and 0.412 ( p 5 0.000), respectively. This suggests that the largest ﬁrms face a general, rather than speciﬁc, stakeholder pressure. Their size ensures that their operations are highly visible to regulators, pres- sure groups, and the media. It may be that coincident with this heightened visibility is a pressure to demonstrate responsible action that transcends any single, salient issue that most closely relates to their activities. We submit factors two further that may contribute to the observed pattern of voluntary disclosure. Firstly, it may be the case that the costs of an active social disclosure strategy are rather than increasing, largely ﬁxed, in the breadth of the programme. This is to say, once the infrastructure required to make one type of social disclosure is in place, it can be employed more widely at relatively little extra cost. Sec- ondly, partial disclosure may be viewed cynically by stakeholders. To concentrate exclusively upon that aspect of social performance that most closely relates to the ﬁrm’s activities would be to risk being viewed as self-interested, rather than socially minded. A commitment to issues that seemingly hold no inﬂuence over ﬁnancial perfor- mance creates an impression of altruism that does much to establish the ﬁrm’s social responsiveness. Thus somewhat perversely, a general policy of social performance and disclosure may augment a ﬁrm’s strategic position because it appears not to. Conclusion This paper has examined the patterns in voluntary social disclosures made by a sample of large UK companies. The analysis has focused upon three key issues: interaction between a ﬁrm’s disclosure decisions; links to the nature of a ﬁrm’s activities; and links to the ﬁrm characteristics of size, media exposure, and social performance. Our ﬁndings indicate that there is a positive correlation between participation in one form of voluntary social disclosure and participation in others. We also ﬁnd some evidence that a ﬁrm’s disclosure r Blackwell Publishing Ltd. 2004 95 Volume 13 Numbers 2/3 April/July 2004 strategy is inﬂuenced by the nature of a ﬁrm’s activities, and that participation is positively related to a ﬁrm’s size, media visibility, and social performance. Our evidence concerning the link between participation in each individual disclosure and ﬁrm size is consistent with earlier evidence (e.g. Cowen et al. 1987, Arora & Cason 1996). However, our ﬁndings also suggest that larger ﬁrms are more likely to make multiple disclosures. The role of corporate visibility has been less commonly addressed. As larger ﬁrms tend to be more visible, our results provide a more comp- lete picture of the mechanism by which ﬁrm size promotes participation than does much of the previous literature. Also, that more visible orga- nisations are more likely to participate suggests that disclosure is employed as a means of managing external stakeholder perceptions. Our ﬁndings relating to the role of social performance differ from those most typically found (Ullmann 1985). While previous ﬁndings have been largely inconclusive, we observe a highly signiﬁcant positive correlation between participation in voluntary disclosures and ﬁrm social perfor- mance. It is important to acknowledge, though, that it is not possible to attribute causality without formal econometric modelling. Our analysis cannot isolate the effect of each individual factor while controlling for the effects of all other variables. Thus, a multivariate analysis, particu- larly one employing a longitudinal sample, may shed rather more light upon the motives for voluntary social disclosure. to community projects, or only to health and safety policies, etc. Others have a broader dis- closure policy and may cover all of these dimen- sions of corporate social responsibility. 3. Recent examples include concern over the pricing and distribution policies of AIDS-related drugs in South Africa and continuing concern over the marketing of prepared baby foods. 4. An inability to meet data requirements for some ﬁrms reduced the sample from 150 ﬁrms to 134. 5. We tested the reliability of the Corporate Register coding by recoding a small sample of the annual reports in question, and found the coding of Corporate Register to be wholly reliable. 6. Here then, we employ a frequency-based analysis, i.e. one that describes whether or not a disclosure is made. An alternative approach would be to employ content analysis, where it is the character- istics of disclosures (e.g. length in words, sentences or pages, or type of information given), rather than their presence, that are the focus of attention. It is worth noting that the ﬁner detail captured in content analysis provides an improved basis for inferences regarding reporting intent. 7. Following the general approach used by Graves & Waddock (1994) for KLD data we translated EIRIS text grades into number grades. In each case, higher numbers indicate a higher degree of social responsiveness. 8. The 2002 index is the seventh annual index of environmental engagement. The index of corpo- rate responsibility was ﬁrst reported in 2002. 9. As each observation relates to a different ﬁrm, the Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcients describe, across the sample as a whole, any association be- tween a ﬁrm’s behaviour for one kind of dis- closure and that for another.

Also, others have noted a ‘lack of variability in the issues covered in corporate annual reports [that] suggests that perhaps too much research attention has been paid to this form of corporate commu- nication’ (Robertson & Nicholson 1996: 1104). Therefore, we focus upon alternative forms of voluntary disclosure in the hope of ﬁnding greater variation across ﬁrms.
