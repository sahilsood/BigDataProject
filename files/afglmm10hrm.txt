A DEMS typi- cally includes diversity training and monitoring recruitment, pay, and promo- tion across minority or other disadvantaged groups. Our analysis of quantita- tive data from service and manufacturing organizations in Ireland conﬁ rms that  HPWS practices are associated with positive business performance and ﬁ nds  speciﬁ cally  that  DEMS  practices  are  positively  associated  with  higher  labor  productivity and workforce innovation and lower voluntary employee turnover. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This last  point is not so easy to sell as the ﬁ rst  two—especially  to  engineers  who  want the data. What I need is the data,  the evidence that diverse groups do better  (emphasis  added).—Lew  Platt,  former  CEO of Hewlett, Packard, Comments to  the Diversity Research Network, Stanford  Business School, March 18, 1998  In  organizations  today  considerable  em- phasis  is  placed  on  facilitating  diversity  and encouraging equality, assuming that,  if properly embraced, diversity and equal- ity  management  can  lead  to  improved  firm performance (Jackson, Joshi, & Erhardt,  2003; Thomas & Ely, 1996).

What was initially termed  “equal  opportunity”  began  as  an  effort  to  meet  legislative  require- ments  (Wilson,  1996).  In  many  organizations, however, it has be- come  a  strategic  priority  for  im- proving  performance  (Carnevale  &  Stone,  1994;  European  Com- mission, 2005), despite little tan- gible evidence showing that equal  opportunity initiatives are an ap- propriate  use  of  resources  (Char- tered  Institute  of  Personnel  and  Development (CIPD), 2006; Jayne  & Dipboye, 2004). Although many definitions of  the term “diversity management”  exist  (e.g.,  Ellis  &  Sonnenfield,  1993; Kandola & Fullerton, 1994;  Thomas & Ely, 1996), two are es- pecially  helpful  in  capturing  the  concept’s essence. The first states  that diversity management is “an  approach  to  workplace  equality  [that]  draws  its  distinctiveness  largely from its focus on equality  through  ‘difference’  rather  than  ‘sameness’” (Gagnon & Cornelius,  2002,  p.  36).  The  second  states  that  managing  diversity  involves  “understanding that there are dif- ferences  among  employees  and  that these differences, if properly  managed,  are  an  asset  to  work  being  done  more  efficiently  and  effectively”  (Bartz,  Hillman,  Leh- rer, & Mayhugh, 1990, p. 321). For organizations  to make informed  decisions regarding  the use of scarce  resources  to improve  performance,  they must be able  to compare the  effects of different  potential initiatives.  In this study, we  demonstrate that  investing in DEMS  can contribute  significantly to  organizational  performance. Diversity  and  equality  man- agement  systems  (DEMS)  may  be  composed  of many facets, including written policies on  diversity  and  equality  management,  diver- sity/equality training for staff, and monitor- ing recruitment, promotion, and relative pay  by gender, age, and ethnic origin. In general,  however, diversity and equality management  systems provide challenges to the way people  conceptualize  and  tackle  issues  that  are  re- lated  to  equality,  sameness,  difference,  dis- crimination,  and  injustice  in  employment.  (For  an  in-depth  analysis  of  these  areas,  see  Liff  &  Wajcman,  1996;  Noon  &  Ogbonna,  2001.) For organizations to make informed deci- sions regarding the use of scarce resources to  improve  performance,  they  must  be  able  to  compare the effects of different potential ini- tiatives.  In  this  study,  we  demonstrate  that  investing  in  DEMS  can  contribute  signifi- cantly  to  organizational  performance.  We  also suggest that the traditional definition of  HPWS should be expanded to include diver- sity and equality management. Theoretical Framework and  Hypotheses Expanding the Deﬁ nition of High  Performance Work Systems A  growing  body  of  research  has  suggested  that using a package or system of HR prac- tices that includes comprehensive employee  recruitment and selection procedures, com- pensation  and  performance  management,  extensive  communication  and  employee  involvement,  and  training  and  develop- ment  can  improve  acquiring,  developing,  and retaining a workforce that is a source of  potential  competitive  advantage  (Datta,  Guthrie,  &  Wright,  2005).  These  HR  prac- tices  are  referred  to  as  high  involvement  (Guthrie, 2001), high commitment (Arthur,  1994),  or  high  performance  (Datta  et  al.;  Huselid,  1995;  Pfeffer,  1995)  work  systems  (HPWS). Much of the analysis of HPWS originates  from  the  study  of  strategic  human  resource  management (hereafter strategic HRM), where  researchers  have  examined  the  impact  of  bundles  of  HR  practices  on  firm  outcomes  such as productivity. The idea that a system  of HR practices may be more than the sum of  the parts has given rise to debate concerning  the  specific  configuration  of  practices  that  should constitute a high performance system.  Recently,  Labour  International  the  Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm   THE IMPACT OF DIVERSITY AND EQUALITY MANAGEMENT ON FIRM PERFORMANCE  979 Organization (ILO, 2006) suggested that high- performing  workplaces  shared  five  main  characteristics: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. People management: A focus on HR/ people issues, including fair and open  recruitment, effective management, and  well-established discipline and grievance  procedures. Employee involvement: A focus on em- ployee involvement that encourages  teamwork and developing responsibility,  trust, and communication. Training and development: A focus on  continuously developing employees. Diversity and equality: A commitment to  equality and a diverse workforce by pro- moting equal opportunity. Work organization: A variety of working  patterns, including flexible work arrange- ments, work-life balance, family-friendly  policies, and organizing work to match  demand. Despite  ILO’s  inclusion  of  diversity  and  equality (characteristic 4, above), no research  of  which  we  are  aware  has  investigated  the  impact of diversity and equality management  systems,  including  work  organization,  be- yond the influence of traditional HPWS prac- tices (captured in characteristics 1–3, above)  on  firm  performance.  The  goal  of  this  re- search is to address this gap. The Effect of Traditional HPWS on  Firm Performance In  many  instances,  the  term  strategic  HRM  is  used interchangeably with HPWS, and numer- ous strategic HRM studies have examined the  impact of bundles of HR practices on firm out- comes (Doty, Glick, & Huber, 1993). According  to  some  proponents,  however,  the  language  used  in  relation  to  these  high-performing  practices  differs  slightly  from  traditional  HR  strategy  in  that  “these  practices  enable  and  motivate workers to develop, share, and apply  their knowledge and skills more fully than do  traditional  practices,  with  positive  implica- tions  for  the  quality  of  jobs  as  well  as  for  performance” (Godard, 2004, p. 349). Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm Notably,  Huselid’s  (1995)  landmark  study  examined  the  relationship  between  using  HPWS  and  firm  performance.  His  main  finding  was  that  greater  use  of  HR  practices  such  as  comprehensive  recruit- ment  and  selection  and  extensive  training  and  development  was  associated  with  de- creased  rates  of  employee  turnover  and  higher levels of productivity and profitabil- ity. Since that seminal work was published,  many  studies  have  found  a  positive  rela- tionship between adopting specific bundles  of HR practices and firm-level performance  outcomes,  including  productivity  and  in- novation  (Appelbaum,  Bailey,  Berg,  &  Kal- leberg, 2000; Becker & Huselid, 1998; CIPD,  2006; Datta et al., 2005; Flood, Guthrie, Liu,  & MacCurtain, 2005; Guthrie, 2001; Huselid,  1995; MacDuffie, 1995). Further supporting  HPWS, Becker and Huselid (1998) stated:  As ﬁ rms move away from centralized  command  and  control  management  structures,  HPWS  should  be  able  to  provide a signiﬁ cant, and increasingly  important,  source  of  value  creation.  Within this context, a ﬁ rm’s workforce  and its systems for managing people  are seen as an investment rather than  a cost to be minimized. (p. 92) Clearly,  previous  studies  have  researched  the  impact  of  HPWS  on  firm  performance  in  depth. In light of our interest in highlighting  the significant impact of DEMS over and above  that  of  traditional  HPWS,  however,  we  must  first ascertain the impact of HPWS on firm per- formance  in  our  sample.  Guided  by  previous  evidence, we test the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1: Increased use of high performance  work systems results in increased labor produc- tivity,  increased  workforce  innovation,  and  de- creased voluntary employee turnover. Adopting Diversity and Equality  Management Systems The question of distinguishing between em- ployment  opportunity  initiatives  and  managing  diversity  is  an  interesting  one.  980  HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NOVEMBER–DECEMBER 2010 a high profile in  organizational  debate, partly  due to changes  in workforce  demographics,  increased  globalization,  and changes in  organizational  structures. Currently, managing  diversity is enjoying  Some  researchers  have  suggested  that  em- ployment opportunity initiatives and manag- ing diversity are at opposite ends of the same  continuum and merely indicate a progression  in developing equality in organizations (Mc- Dougall, 1998), while others have suggested  that  it  is  not  useful  to  distinguish  between  them  (Malvin  &  Girling,  2000).  Currently,  managing diversity is enjoying a high profile  in  organizational  debate,  partly  due  to  changes in workforce demographics, increased  globalization,  and  changes  in  or- ganizational  structures  (Cope  &  Kalantzis, 1999). It is not possible,  however,  to  separate  managing  diversity  in  the  workplace  and  providing equal employment op- portunities  because  legislation  supports  and  shapes  the  ways  in  which  diversity  is  managed  (Monks, 2007). Across  the  developed  world,  significant  efforts  have  targeted  making workforces more represen- tative  of  the  general  population.  In  Europe,  Article  13  of  the  Amsterdam Treaty (1997) provides  the European Union with power- ful legal channels through which  the  battle  against  discrimination  and the support of equality in all  arenas,  including  the  workplace,  have  been  strengthened.  In  the  United  States,  federal  legislation  such as Title VII of the Civil Rights  Act  (1964),  the  Age  Discrimina- tion in Employment Act of 1967, and many  state  laws  (which  often  go  further  than  fed- eral laws) require firms to adopt specific tar- gets for the composition of their workforces.  In India, the Equal Remuneration Act (1976)  enforces equal pay for men and women, and  the  Persons  with  Disabilities  Act  (1995)  sets  an employment target of 3% for persons with  disabilities  in  government  organizations.  India  has  also  adopted  some  stringent  affir- mative action rules in an effort to undo dam- age associated with the caste system. For ex- ample, 22.5% of all government jobs, seats in  state-sponsored educational institutions, and  electoral  constituencies  are  reserved  for  per- sons  who  belong  to  scheduled  castes  and  tribes  and  are  considered  to  be  at  a  greater  disadvantage than the general population. In  China,  under  the  Employment  Promotion  Law (2008) and earlier legislation, discrimina- tion on the basis of race, ethnicity, sex, and  religion has been prohibited since 1995. Fur- ther, discrimination against disabled persons  has  been  prohibited  since  1991,  hepatitis  B  carriers since 2007, and human immunodefi- ciency virus (HIV) carriers, acquired immuno- deficiency  syndrome  (AIDS)  sufferers,  and  their family members since 2006. Ireland’s  workplace  equality  principles  are founded in European legislation, such as  the Amsterdam Treaty (1997). The Irish legis- lation that ensures workplace equality derives  mainly  from  the  Employment  Equality  Act  (1998)  and  the  Equality  Act  (2004),  which  forbid discrimination against employees and  those seeking employment in relation to gen- der,  age,  race,  religious  affiliation,  disability,  marital  status,  family  status,  sexual  orienta- tion,  and  membership  in  the  traveler  com- munity  (an  indigenous  ethnic  Irish  group).  People  cannot  be  treated  less  favorably  on  the basis of any of these criteria in relation to  dismissal, pay, harassment and sexual harass- ment, working conditions, promotion, access  to employment, and several other areas. Business Beneﬁ ts and Challenges of  Diversity and Equality Management While  considerable  research  on  diversity  has  been  undertaken  since  the  mid-1990s,  relatively little hard data supports the claim  that diversity and equality initiatives influ- ence  firm  performance  (Monks,  2007).  In  general,  studies  that  have  examined  firm  performance  have  usually  used  financial  indicators  such  as  return  on  investment,  revenue,  costs,  and  profits  (Jayne  &  Dip- boye,  2004).  Organizations  frequently  pro- tect such hard data because it is potentially  commercially  sensitive  (Monks).  Several  qualitative studies have shown broadly pos- itive  results,  but  the  ability  to  translate  equality and diversity policies into improved  performance  is  highly  context-specific  (Jayne  &  Dipboye;  Kochan  et  al.,  2003;  Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm   THE IMPACT OF DIVERSITY AND EQUALITY MANAGEMENT ON FIRM PERFORMANCE  981 Triandis, 1995; Yasbek, 2004), and the results  are seldom readily generalizable. Thus,  an  obvious  question  is,  Why  do  we expect DEMS to result in improved or- ganizational  performance?  Theoretical  support  for  the  idea  comes  from  Appel- baum et al.’s (2000) AMO theory of perfor- mance, which states that performance is a  function  of  employee  ability,  motivation,  and opportunity. In applying AMO theory  to the context of the current study, there- fore,  we  argue  that  performance  depends  on  a  workforce  that  is  (1)  competent  and  able (through both non-discriminatory re- cruiting  and  training  and  development  practices), that is (2) motivated (meaningful  work  combined  with  a  sense  of  workplace  justice), and that has (3) opportunities (em- ployee  involvement  practices  that  provide  employees with the opportunity to contrib- ute within the firm). If a diverse workforce is  managed effectively (e.g., provided with rel- evant  training  and  development  and  high  levels  of  involvement),  its  contribution  to  the organization will be greater. While most  of the diversity literature has focused on the  relationship between diversity and individual  and team outcomes, focus has increased on  managing  diversity  and  its  impact  at  the  firm  level  (Richard,  2000).  Moss-Kanter  (1983)  noted  that  com   panies  that  effectively  managed diversity had higher levels of inno- vation,  specifically  noting  that  these  compa- nies  performed  better  than  most  in  eradicat- ing  racism  and  sexism  and  employing  a  diverse workforce. In a study of the effects of  racial diversity in the banking industry, Rich- ard    found  that  effectively  managed  cultural  diversity  contributed  to  firm  competitive  advantage. Cox and Blake (1991) argued that  the effective management of diversity can cre- ate  a  competitive  advantage  that  focuses  on  cost, attracting high-caliber employees, creativity  and innovation, market success, and organiza- tional  flexibility.  While  limited  evidence  ex- plicitly  demonstrates  a  relationship  between  managing  diversity  and  firm-level  outcomes,  evidence exists that the failure to manage di- versity  effectively  can  adversely  affect  the  firm’s  competitive  advantage.  For  example,  studies  of  male  and  female  managers  in  the  Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm United States found links between ineffective  (gender) diversity management and turnover  (Schwartz, 1989). Recently,  the  European  Commission  investigated the use of diversity and equality  procedures  and  policies  in  European  companies  and  the  business  case  for  such  policies.  Their  results  indicated  that  48%  of  responding  companies  were  engaged  actively  in  promoting  workplace  diversity  and an anti-discrimination agenda (European  Commission,  2005).  The  prac- tices  associated  with  this  active  engagement  included  initiatives  such  as  monitoring  and  regular  reporting of diversity targets and  strong management accountabil- ity  for  diversity  and  equality  management.  Eighty-three  percent  of  the  companies  that  adopted such an agenda reported  that  it  made  sound  business  sense.  Diversity  within  work  groups and teams has been shown  to bring its own rewards, includ- ing  a  healthy  return  on  invest- ment  capital  (Gardenswartz  &  Rowe,  1998).  Specifically,  the  European  Com- mission  study  and  others  have  reported  that  the  main  business  benefits  of  focusing  on  diversity  are  the  ability  to  recruit  from  a  wider selection of people and re- tain  better  workers  for  longer  (Iles,  1995;  McKay  et  al.,  2007;  Ross & Schneider, 1992), broader  market  intelligence  and  interna- tionalization  (Cox  &  Blake,  1991),  greater  creativity  and  in- novation (Gardenswartz & Rowe,  1998; Iles, 1995; West & Anderson,  1998;  Wilson,  1996),  diverse  perspectives  on  business  issues  and  improved  problem  solving  and  decision  making  (Adler,  1997;  Flood,  MacCurtain,  &  West,  2001),  im- proved  marketing  (Metcalf  &  Forth,  2000),  improved  community  relations  and  an  en- hanced  company  image  (Nykiel,  1997),  reduced costs linked to turnover and absen- teeism  (Kandola,  1995;  Ross  &  Schneider,  from  human  function of employee  ability, motivation,  and opportunity. Thus, an obvious  question is, Why do  we expect DEMS to  result in improved  organizational  performance?  Theoretical  support for the  idea comes from  Appelbaum et al.’s  (2000) AMO theory  of performance,  which states that  performance is a  982  HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NOVEMBER–DECEMBER 2010 1992), and increased resilience and flexibil- ity (Gardenswartz & Rowe). Recently, the  European  Commission  investigated the  use of diversity  and equality  procedures and  policies in European  companies and  the business case  for such policies.  Many of these firm-level benefits may ac- crue from the benefits that employees derive  from DEMS (including work orga- nization),  such  as  reduced  work- related  stress,  increased  job  satis- faction  (O’Connell  &  Russell,  2005),  and  an  increased  sense  of  fairness  in  the  workplace  (Siegel,  Post,  Garden,  Brockner,  &  Fishman, 2005). According to Sie- gel  et  al.,  employees’  belief  that  the firm treats them fairly can in- fluence a number of attitudes and  behaviors  of  organizational  rele- vance,  such  as  commitment  (Brockner,  Siegel,  Daly,  Tyler,  &  Martin, 1997) and trust (Konovsky  &  Pugh,  1994).  In  addition,  the  greater  the  degree  to  which  em- ployees perceive that their firm is  providing  them  with  a  working  environment  where  social  bene- fits and a sense of fairness are im- portant  values,  the  more  moti- vated they will be to reward their  firm  with  discretionary  effort  (Lambert, 2000). Despite  some  evidence  of  the  benefits of increasing diversity and  equality  in  workplaces,  findings  across  studies  have  been  mixed.  For example, studies of gender di- versity  have  found  that  its  effects  on  performance  are  sometimes  positive  (Jackson  &  Joshi,  2004;  Kochan et al., 2003; Rentsch & Kli- moski, 2001; Yasbek, 2004), some- times negative (Jehn & Bezrukova,  2003), and sometimes insignificant  (Richard,  2000;  Watson,  Johnson,  Kumar, & Critelli, 1998). This trend  has  been  mirrored  in  racial  diver- sity  (see  Williams  &  O’Reilly,  1998,  for  a  re- view).  Some  researchers  have  suggested  that  creating  a  diverse  organization  but  failing  to  manage  that  diversity  effectively  can  lead  to  negative outcomes such as a lack of consensus  and dysfunctional conflict (Riordan, 2000; Ste- phenson & Lewin, 1996; Williams & O’Reilly,  Their results  indicated that  48% of responding  companies were  engaged actively  in promoting  workplace diversity  and an anti- discrimination  agenda (European  Commission, 2005). 1998).  Recognizing  that  diverse  work  groups  sometimes  do  not  reach  their  full  potential,  Jehn and Bezrukova (2003) and Kochan et al.  (2003) highlighted that while diversity may be  beneficial,  diversity  and  equality  initiatives  must  be  managed  effectively  to  realize  these  benefits.  It  could  be  argued,  then,  that  effec- tively managing diversity and equality systems  can help achieve the business benefits of diver- sity (e.g., effective problem solving and inno- vation)  without  triggering  the  negative  outcomes of diversity (e.g., dysfunctional con- flict).  Such  effective  management  initiatives  could  include  maintaining  top  management  support,  incorporating  diversity  and  equality  in  the  organization’s  mission  and  vision  (including diversity and equality in setting ob- jectives  and  reward  and  recognition),  provid- ing  training  related  to  diversity  and  equality  across all levels in the firm, and measuring the  impact  of  diversity  and  equality  within  the  firm (Monks, 2007). Quantifying the Beneﬁ ts of a Diverse  Workforce Some  firms  have  difficulty  assessing  the  net  impact of equality and diversity policies; after  all, it is far easier to identify and measure tan- gible costs than benefits that by their nature  tend  to  yield  rewards  in  the  longer  term.  In  this  study,  however,  we  attempt  to  examine  quantitatively the business benefits of manag- ing diversity and equality effectively. Specifi- cally,  we  examine  the  effects  of  HPWS  and  DEMS on labor productivity, workforce inno- vation, and employee turnover. Following the  lead  of  other  studies  (e.g.,  Guthrie,  2001;  Huselid,  1995),  we  define  labor  productivity  as sales revenue per employee; measure work- force  innovation  as  sales  revenue  generated  from  newly  introduced  products  (again  per  employee);  and  measure  employee  turnover  as the firm’s annual voluntary turnover rate. Successful diversity and equality initiatives  do not normally exist as stand-alone entities,  but  as  a  component  of  an  integrated  human  resource management system (Benschop, 2001;  Monks,  2007).  It  is  imperative,  therefore,  to  account for other aspects of the HRM system  that  could  also  account  for  improvements  in  Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm   THE IMPACT OF DIVERSITY AND EQUALITY MANAGEMENT ON FIRM PERFORMANCE  983 performance.  Thus,  we  isolate  the  effects  of  DEMS over and above performance enhance- ments associated with other high performance  HR practices. More formally: Hypothesis 2: Increased use of diversity/equality  management  systems  results  in  increased  labor  productivity, workforce innovation, and decreased  voluntary employee turnover, over and above the  contribution of high performance work systems. Study Context: The Irish Labor Market The labor market in the Republic of Ireland is  the setting for our study. The country’s legis- latives  efforts  and  Ireland’s  robust  “Celtic  tiger” economy during the 1990s and 2000s  have  caused  Ireland’s  workforce  to  become  significantly more diverse in terms of nation- ality, language, ethnicity, and religious affili- ation.  This  increased  diversity  was  mainly  due to the population’s share of non-Irish im- migrants increasing from 3% in 1993 to 10%  in  2006  (Smyth,  Darmody,  McGinnity,  &  Byrne, 2009). In addition, the rates of females  participating in the workforce increased from  42% in 1990 to almost 58% in 2003 (Central  Statistics Office [CSO], 2003). The proportion  of  older  people  in  the  Irish  population  has  also risen. It is expected that the proportion  of those aged between 45 and 64 years in the  labor  force  will  continue  to  rise.  The  rising  average  age  among  workers  will  create  both  opportunities  and  challenges  for  employers,  bringing  an  increased  availability  of  labor,  but  also  the  need  to  provide  more  flexible  working  arrangements  (Equality  Authority,  2002a).  Additional  participation  is  also  ex- pected  from  those  with  disabilities,  as  they  remain a relatively untapped potential labor  pool (Gannon & Nolan, 2004). Religious di- versity is increasing in line with immigration,  and  citizens  are  also  changing  their  aware- ness of sexual diversity, particularly following  provisions for civil partnership in many Eu- ropean countries, including Ireland. Research  on employing gay and lesbian people, how- ever, indicates that they may still experience  hostility  and  discrimination  at  work  (Equal- ity Authority, 2002b; Zappone, 2003). Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm Effectively managing  diversity and  equality systems  can help achieve  the business  benefits of diversity  (e.g., effective  problem solving and  innovation) without  triggering the  negative outcomes  of diversity (e.g.,  dysfunctional  conflict). Since 2007, statistics on labor market sup- ply have shown some decline in immigrants  due to the current world economic crisis. The  Irish  economy  is  experiencing  a  decline  in  the  number  of  migrant  inflows,  and  the  ability  of  the  Irish  econ- omy to absorb the migrant inflow  has  also  decreased.  Nonetheless,  in the third quarter of 2008, non- Irish  people  still  accounted  for  80%  of  the  year-on-year  increase  in  the  size  of  the  labor  force  (22,000),  which  at  that  time  was  2.24 million (Foras Áiseanna Sao- thair [FAS], 2008). Thus, the Irish  economy still provides a rich con- text for a study of diversity that is  not  limited  to  diversity  based  solely  on  nationality  but  also  in- cludes gender, disability, age, and  religious background.  In some countries, workforce  diversity has been a fact of life for  many  years,  but  until  the  late  1990s, Ireland had a relatively ho- mogeneous  workforce.  As  the  workforce  has  become  more  di- verse, many indigenous and mul- tinational  organizations  based  in  Ireland have struggled to manage  their  newly  culturally  diverse  workforces  ef- fectively.  This  challenge  is  experienced  not  only by companies operating in Ireland, how- ever.  As  evidenced  by  research  worldwide,  many organizations experience difficulties in  harnessing the positive effects of employing a  diverse  workforce  (Cope  &  Kalantzis,  1999).  This  study,  therefore,  aims  to  examine  the  extent  to  which  diversity  and  equality  are  managed actively to address issues of equality,  discrimination, and injustice in employment  (Noon  &  Ogbonna,  2001)  and  the  extent  to  which diversity and equality issues are impor- tant in enhancing business performance (Ko- chan et al., 2003). Method The  quantitative  approach  adopted  here  draws on the work of other researchers in this  area  (Datta  et  al.,  2005;  Flood  et  al.,  2005;  984  HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NOVEMBER–DECEMBER 2010 Guthrie, 2001; Huselid, 1995). The procedure  was  to  solicit  survey-based  descriptions  of  management  practices  in  the  areas  of  com- munication  and  participation,  training  and  development,  staffing  and  recruitment,  performance management and remuneration,  and equality and diversity management, and  to  match  these  with  indices  of  firm  perfor- mance.  To  achieve  this  objective,  two  sepa- rate  survey  instruments  focusing  on  general  management  practices  and  human  resource  practices were sent to the managing director  (MD) and to the senior HR manager, respec- tively,  of  identified  firms.  The  general  man- agement practices survey obtained measures  on  a  variety  of  firm  characteristics.  In  addi- tion  to  repeating  some  of  these  same  mea- sures (to assess measurement reliability), the  HR  practices  survey  asked  respondents  to  “describe HR practices in your operations in  Ireland during 2005–06.” After pilot testing,  surveys were mailed to executives identified  in sample firms, followed by reminder letters  and a second copy of the survey. Sample The  study,  designed  according  to  the  total  design  method  (Dillman,  2000),  was  exe- cuted from May to October 2006. The sam- ple of 1,000 firms was drawn from the Irish  Times Top 1000 Companies database, which  includes a representative, multi-industry set  of  Irish-based  operations.  The  sample  included  both  indigenous  Irish  firms  and  foreign-owned firms with operations in Ire- land.  In  total,  241  companies  participated;  132 of them completed both surveys (which  was necessary for a reliable result), resulting  in an overall usable response rate of 13.2%.  This response rate is in line with typical re- sponse  rates  for  research  of  this  nature,  which  range  from  6%  to  28%  (Becker  &  Huselid,  1998).  This  is  especially  typical  given that only matched pairs are included  in our response rate. The  threat  of  non-response  bias  exists  whenever  significant  numbers  of  the  tar- geted population fail to respond. Given the  relatively low response rate, we checked for  possible  non-response  bias  using  a  time  trend extrapolation test in which we com- pared  late  versus  early  respondents  along  key study variables. The assumption behind  this test is that late respondents (responses  were  received  after  the  second  round  of  mailing and follow-up telephone calls) are  similar  to  non-respondents  (Armstrong  &  Overton,  1977).  T-tests  conducted  showed  no  significant  differences  between  early  and late respondents along any of the key  study  variables.  In  addition,  we  compared  responding  versus  non-responding  firms  using limited data available from the 2005  version of the Irish Times Top 1000 Compa- nies.  Specifically,  we  used  these  data  to  compare  respondents  to  non-respondents  in terms of company size and industry dis- tribution.  Using  a  one-way  ANOVA  proce- dure,  we  compared  the  respondents  with  the  Top  1000  firms  and  found  no  signifi- cant  differences  with  regard  to  company  size  or  industry.  While  these  comparisons  do  not  rule  out  systematic  non-response  bias, they do increase confidence that non- response bias does not threaten the validity  of our results. Responding firms represented a variety of  industries, including transportation and com- munications  (7%);  financial  services  (10%);  chemical  products  (5%);  retail/wholesale  (14%);  agriculture,  energy,  or  construction  (16%);  service  (13%);  and  manufacturing  (35%). Of the organizations that responded,  50%  (n  ⫽  66)  were  subsidiaries  of  foreign  companies, including those from the United  States (26%, n ⫽ 34), Germany (7%, n ⫽ 9),  and  the  United  Kingdom  (5%,  n  ⫽  7).  The  remaining  50%  were  wholly  Irish-owned  organizations.  The  average  firm  had  been  established for about 37 years, and the median  number of employees was 270. Measures Data regarding HPWS and diversity/equality  systems were obtained from the HR practices  survey. Data used to compute workforce pro- ductivity  (sales  revenue  and  number  of  employees)  and  innovation  outcome  mea- sures (percent of sales derived from recently  introduced  products  and  services)  were  Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm   THE IMPACT OF DIVERSITY AND EQUALITY MANAGEMENT ON FIRM PERFORMANCE  985 obtained from both the HR practices survey  and the GM practices survey, as well as from  publicly  available  sales  revenue  figures.  As  has been done in other work (e.g., Guthrie,  2001;  Huselid,  1995),  voluntary  turnover  was  obtained  from  the  HR  practices  survey  respondents. High Performance Work Systems Explicitly based upon the study of Datta et al.  (2005),  we  used  18  HR  practices  from  the  areas  of  staffing,  performance  management,  and  remuneration;  training  and  develop- ment;  and  communication  and  employee  involvement  to  form  a  single  index  repre- senting a measure of HPWS. Because practices  tend  to  vary  across  employee  groups,  ques- tions related to HR practices were asked sepa- rately for two categories of employees: Group  A was composed of production, maintenance,  service,  and  clerical  employees  (sometimes  called “non-exempt” employees), and Group  B was composed of executives, managers, su- pervisors, and professional/technical employ- ees (sometimes called “exempt” employees).  This categorization scheme was derived from  the  groupings  used  by  Huselid  (1995)  and  Datta et al.  Sample items are “What propor- tion of your employees from Groups A and B  are  administered  one  or  more  employment  tests (e.g., skills tests, aptitude tests, or men- tal/cognitive  ability  tests)  prior  to  hiring?”  “What  proportion  of  your  employees  from  Groups  A  and  B  have  received  intensive/ex- tensive  training  in  generic  skills  (e.g.,  problem-solving,  communication  skills,  etc.)?” “What proportion of your employees  from Groups A and B receive compensation  partially  contingent  on  group  performance  (e.g.,  profit-sharing,  gain-sharing,  team- based)?” See Appendix A for a full list of the  18  HR  practices.  Using  the  number  of  em- ployees  in  each  occupational  group,  a  weighted average for each practice was com- puted. To illustrate, assume a particular com- pany  has  500  Group  A  employees  and  100  Group B employees and that 20% of Group A  employees  and  40%  of  Group  B  employees  “receive formal performance appraisals on a  routine basis.” The weighted average for this  Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm HR practice would be [(500*20) + (100*40)]/600  ⫽ 23.33. This averaging technique was applied  to  each  of  the  18  HR  practices.  These  18  weighted averages were then used to form a  composite  scale.  The  Cronbach’s  alpha  for  the computed scale was .854. Diversity/Equality Management Practices Questions  related  to  diversity  and  equality  management  practices  (n  ⫽  17)  focused  on  policies  and  monitoring  practices.  Sample  items are “What proportion of your total em- ployees receives equality/diversity training?”  “To what extent is equality and diversity in- tegrated  into  overall  corporate  strategy?”  “Does  this  workplace  have  a  formal  written  policy  on  managing  diversity?”  “Do  you  monitor  recruitment  and  selection  by  gen- der?” See Appendix B for a listing of all items.  Because the scales associated with the items  varied, they were standardized to a common  scale using a z-score transformation. These measures were original to this study;  therefore,  we  conducted  exploratory  factor  analysis. Johnson and Wichern (1982) recom- mended  validating  factor  solutions  by  com- paring  the  consistency  of  results  yielded  by  alternative extraction methods. The principal  components (PC) and principal axis factoring  (PAF) techniques yielded parallel results: four  factors with very similar factor structures. Fac- tor 1 was composed of the four “recruitment  and selection” monitoring items; factor 2 was  composed of the four “promotions” monitor- ing items; factor 3 was composed of the four  “pay rate” monitoring items; and factor 4 was  composed  of  the  remaining  five  items.  See  Appendix B for a full list of the diversity and  equality management items. Using  the  factor  results  as  a  guide,  we  created four composite scales, among which  intercorrelations  were  fairly  high  (average  r  >  .40).  Given  these  intercorrelations  and  the  present  study’s  focus  (which  is  not  on  the dimensionality of diversity management,  per  se),  a  second-order  factor  analysis  was  performed  to  determine  whether  the  four  primary  factors  would  converge  into  a  single, higher-order factor. Higher-order fac- tor analysis identifies areas of generalization  986  HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NOVEMBER–DECEMBER 2010 across primary factors; that is, if primary fac- tors  (i.e.,  first-order)  are  correlated,  then  these  correlations  give  rise  to  second-order  factors.  Higher-order  analyses  can  continue  until  only  one  factor  is  produced  or  until  uncorrelated  factors  occur  (Gorsuch,  1983).  Our  assumption  is  that  our  four  primary  factors  are  intercorrelated  because  they  are  influenced  by  a  broader  underlying  con- struct.  The  secondary  factor  analysis  results  were consistent with this assumption: a sin- gle factor was extracted. Accordingly, a single  diversity/equality management scale was cre- ated  for  each  responding  firm.  Further  evi- dence for the interrelatedness of these items  is  the  high  Cronbach’s  alpha  (.851).  Cron- bach’s alpha, which is mathematically equiv- alent to the average of all possible split-half  estimates,  will  take  on  a  high  value  when  items  have  significant  shared  variance,  that  is, high intercorrelations. Labor Productivity As  per  other  studies  (e.g.,  Guthrie,  2001;  Huselid,  1995),  labor  productivity  was  mea- sured  as  revenue  created  per  employee.  Data  on the most recent estimates of total sales and  total employment were collected via question- naires  from  both  respondent  groups.  Labor  productivity was calculated as total firm reve- nue divided by the total number of employees.  The  computed  intra-class  correlation  coeffi- ⫽ .830) supports the reliability of  cient (ICC2  these data. Because our primary independent  variables were obtained from the HR practices  surveys,  we  reduced  the  threat  of  common  method  bias  by  using  the  GM  practices  sur- vey’s  labor  productivity  components.  A  log  transformation corrected for data skewness. enue  generated  by  selling  new  products  or  services. This sales figure was then divided by  the number of employees to obtain our mea- sure  of  workforce  innovation,  an  indication  of  per-capita  sales  derived  from  recently  in- troduced  products  or  services.  This  measure  captures  a  workforce’s  ability  to  impact  organizational  efficiency  and  innovation  through  process  and  product  innovations.  These  estimates  were  provided  by  respon- dents from both the HR practices survey and  the  GM  practices  survey.  The  ICC2  value  (.961)  supported  the  reliability  of  these  re- sponses. As above, we used the GM practices  survey respondents’ data to reduce the threat  of same-source bias and a log transformation  to correct for data skewness. Employee Turnover In  this  research,  the  measure  of  a  firm’s  employee  turnover  rates  was  taken  from  responses  to  the  following  survey  prompt  on the HR practices survey: “Please estimate  your  annual  voluntary  employee  turnover  rate  (percentage  who  voluntarily  departed  your  organization).”  This  question  was  asked  separately  for  both  categories  of  employees  (Group  A  and  Group  B).  A  weighted average of these separate estimates  was computed to represent the overall aver- age rate of employee turnover for each firm,  and  values  were  log-transformed  to  correct  for skewness.1 Control Variables We used a number of control variables in our  ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  regression  models: Workforce Innovation Workforce  innovation  was  quantified  using  the data on number of employees, sales rev- enue,  and  the  response  to  the  question  “What  proportion  of  your  firm’s  total  sales  (turnover)  comes  from  products  or  services  introduced within the previous 12 months?”  The response to this question was multiplied  by total sales to yield an estimate of sales rev- • • Firm age: The measure of firm age is  taken from the question “How long has  your local organization been in opera- tion?” Reliability statistics supported ag- gregation (ICC2 ⫽ .905), and we used a  log transformation of the mean of both  groups’ responses. Firm size: Number of employees is  used to indicate firm size. To calculate  firm size, we used a log transforma- Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm THE IMPACT OF DIVERSITY AND EQUALITY MANAGEMENT ON FIRM PERFORMANCE  987   • • • • • tion of the mean of both respondent  groups’ responses (ICC2 ⫽ .933). R&D investment as a percentage of sales  revenue: We used the average of the two  respondents (ICC2 ⫽ .803). Unionization: This measure is taken  from the question on the HR survey  “What proportion of your workforce is  unionized?” A weighted average of Group  A and Group B was used to compute the  overall level of unionization. Product differentiation strategy: This mea- sure is taken from the GM practices survey  question “During 2005–06, what propor- tion of your organisation’s total sales  (turnover) was achieved through a product  differentiation strategy?” The log of this  response was used due to skewness. Country of ownership: Firms were clas- sified as Irish indigenous (1) or foreign- owned (0). Industry sector: Firms were dummy- coded to indicate their membership  in one of seven industries: agriculture,  chemicals, manufacturing, retail, ser- vices, transportation/communication,  or financial. The average firm derived  approximately 94% of its sales from its  designated primary industry. This lack  of diversification supports designating a  primary industry for sample firms. In the  OLS analyses, “financial” is the omitted  benchmark industry variable. Results Table  I  presents  the  means,  standard  devia- tions,  correlations,  and  reliability  levels  for  the study’s multiple-item indices. Both of the  index reliabilities, as measured by Cronbach’s  alpha,  exceeded  the  cutoff  of  0.70  for  scale  development suggested by Nunnally (1978). We  used  OLS  regression  analysis  as  the  primary  test  of  our  research  questions.  Regression  results  are  presented  in  Table  II.  Overall, our models accounted for 33.8% of  variance in productivity (F ⫽ 5.14; p < .001),  24.7%  of  variance  in  workforce  innovation  (F ⫽ 3.32; p < .001), and 36.7% of variance in  voluntary turnover rates (F ⫽ 4.23; p < .001).  Models 1, 3, and 5 include the set of control  Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm Consistent with  previous research,  using HPWS  significantly predicts  firm outcomes;  in this case, the  practices of labor  productivity,  workforce  innovation, and  voluntary turnover  affected firm  outcomes—all in the  expected direction. turnover  affected  variables  (firm  origin,  industry  sector,  firm  age, number of employees, level of unioniza- tion,  R&D  investment,  product  differentia- tion  strategy)  and  the  HPWS  scale.  These  models also indicate the proportion of vari- ance  associated  with  the  addition  of  the  HPWS  variable.  Consistent  with  previous  research,  using  HPWS  significantly  predicts  firm  outcomes;  in  this  case,  the  practices  of  labor  productivity,  workforce innovation, and volun- tary  firm  outcomes—all  in  the  expected  direction.  The  effect  of  HPWS  is  strongest in relation to labor pro- ductivity,  where  it  accounts  for  11.2% of variance (p < 0.001) over  and  above  the  effect  of  the  con- trol variables. In relation to work- force  innovation  and  voluntary  turnover,  HPWS  accounts  for  6.6% (p < 0.01) and 5.5% (p < 0.01)  of  variance,  respectively.  These  results  support  Hypothesis  1,  which  predicted  that  increased  use  of  HPWS  would  result  in  increased  labor  productivity,  increased  workforce  innovation,  and decreased voluntary employee  turnover. Models  2,  4,  and  6  illustrate  the effect of adding DEMS to the  equations.  The  analysis  shows  that greater use of DEMS is asso- ciated  with  significantly  higher  labor  pro- ductivity  over  and  above  the  effects  of  HPWS,  accounting  for  2%  unique  variance  (p  <  0.05).  Analyses  also  show  that  greater  use of DEMS is associated with significantly  higher  levels  of  workforce  innovation  over  and above the effects of HPWS. Specifically,  DEMS  accounted  for  2.2%  unique  variance  (p < 0.05). Finally, greater use of DEMS is as- sociated  with  significantly  lower  voluntary  labor turnover, over and above the effects of  HPWS, accounting for 2.5% unique variance  (p < 0.05). These results support Hypothesis  2, which predicted that increased use of di- versity/equality management systems would  result  in  increased  labor  productivity  and  workforce  innovation  and  decreased  988  HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NOVEMBER–DECEMBER 2010 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ) 4 5 8 . 0 ( ) 1 5 8 . 0 ( * * * 1 8 3 . 3 4 1 ⫺ . * 5 8 1 . 0 7 1 ⫺ . 7 0 1 ⫺ . 6 2 1 . ⫺ 8 6 0 ⫺ . * * 8 9 2 . * * 3 8 2 . * * * 9 6 3 . ⫺ 7 6 0 . * 5 0 2 . 7 0 1 ⫺ . 5 5 0 . ⫺ * * 1 4 2 . ⫺ * 6 6 1 . ⫺ * 6 7 1 . ⫺ 7 6 0 . * 7 9 1 . * * * 5 9 3 . ⫺ * * * 8 8 3 . ⫺ 0 3 0 . ⫺ 6 8 0 . ⫺ 8 2 1 . 2 0 0 . 8 3 1 . ⫺ 2 0 0 . ⫺ * * * 2 0 5 . * 4 8 1 . 9 1 1 . * * * 4 7 3 . ⫺ * * * 9 2 3 . ⫺ 5 5 0 . 8 2 1 . * 8 8 1 . * 6 8 1 . 6 1 0 . ⫺ * * 2 5 2 . * 4 0 2 . * 4 6 1 . ⫺ * 4 5 1 . ⫺ 6 9 0 . * * * 4 5 3 . 8 5 1 . 4 3 0 . ⫺ . l e b a t   m o r f   d e t t i m o e r a     s e b a l i r a v   s u o m o t o h c i D   . s n o i t a m r o f s n a r t   e r o c s - z   r o   c i m h t i r a g o   l   e r a   s e r u g ﬁ  n a e m   e h t   f o   e m o S   . l a n o g a i d   e h t   n o   r a e p p a D S 5 4 9 1 . 2 4 5 . 2 9 1 1 . 7 9 1 1 . 2 3 1 1 . 9 2 7 . 7 9 1 1 . 3 2 3 4 . 0 4 3 5 3 . 7 0 1 . 2 n a e M . 3 1 8 4 5 0 0 ⫺ . 6 0 3 1 ⫺ . 7 6 5 . 7 5 7 1 . 9 7 2 3 . 6 5 6 5 . 3 0 8 3 . y t i v i t c u d o r P   3 n o i t a v o n n I   4 r e v o n r u  T 5 S W P H   1 S M E D   2 e g A   6 e z i S   7   D & R   8 5 4 1 4 3 . n o i t a z i n o n U   9 i 5 4 3 3 . y g e t a r t s   f f i D   0 1   s e c i d n i   l m e t i - e p i t l u m   r o f   s a h p a l   t n e i c ﬁ  f e o C   : s e t o N . s t s e t   d e l i a t - o w t   e r a   s r e h t o   l l a   ; s e s e h t o p y h   l a n o i t c e r i d   r o f   s t s e t   d e l i a t - e n O   . 1 0 0 .     < p * * *   ; 1 0 .     0 < p * *   ; 5 0 .   0 < p *   s e l b a i r a V   y d u t S   r o f   s n o i t a l e r r o C d n a     , s n o i t a i v e D d r a d n a t   S   , s n a e M   I   E L B A T Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm   THE IMPACT OF DIVERSITY AND EQUALITY MANAGEMENT ON FIRM PERFORMANCE  989 T A B L E   I I   Multiple Regression Analysis on Labor Productivity, Workplace Innovation, and Employee Turnover Labor Productivity Workplace Innovation Employee Turnover Model 1 Model 2 Model 3 Model 4 Model 5 Model 6 ␤␤  Variables Control Variables Country of ownership  ⫺.125† .006   Agric/Energy/Const. industry .186   Chemical Prods. industry    Mfg. industry ⫺.045 .076   Retail industry   Service industry ⫺.100   Transport/Commun. industry ⫺.073 .163†   Firm age ␤ ⫺.125 ⫺.033 .177 ⫺.074 .040 ⫺.136 ⫺.144 .148 ␤ .058 ⫺.106 .029 .101 .100 ⫺.168 ⫺.161 ⫺.133 ␤ .051 ⫺.140 .016 .071 .065 ⫺.207 ⫺.227† ⫺.144 ␤ ␤ ⫺.112 ⫺.102 ⫺.161 ⫺.228† ⫺.108 ⫺.069 ⫺.145 ⫺.206 .053 .018 .029 ⫺.009 ⫺.264* ⫺.283** ⫺.260** ⫺.199†   Firm size   Unionization    R%D intensity ⫺.475*** ⫺.472*** ⫺.392*** ⫺.386*** .067 .048 .126 .101 .416*** .416*** ⫺.337*** ⫺.319*** ⫺.271** ⫺.292 ⫺.120 ⫺.119 ⫺.103 .020 ⫺.117 ⫺.016 .022 ⫺.134 .034 ⫺.138 .386***   Firm competitive strategy Independent variable 1.

Supplemental Analyses Introducing our measure of diversity/equality  reduced  the  effect  of  our  HPWS  measure  on  the  outcome  variables,  suggesting  the  possibility  that  DEMS  mediates  the  relation- ship  between  HPWS  and  our  outcome  mea- sures.2 According to Baron and Kenny (1986): A  variable  functions  as  a  mediator  when  it  meets  the  following  condi- tions:  (a)  variations  in  levels  of  the  independent  variable  signiﬁ cantly  account for variations in the presumed  mediator (i.e., Path a), (b) variations in  the mediator signiﬁ cantly account for  Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm variations  in  the  dependent  variable  (i.e., Path b), and (c) when Paths a and  b  are  controlled,  a  previously  signiﬁ - cant relation between the independent  and dependent variables is no longer  signiﬁ cant, with the strongest demon- stration of mediation occurring when  Path c is reduced to zero. (p. 1176) Following Baron and Kenny’s (1986) rec- ommendation, we ran a series of OLS regres- sions to examine whether the DEMS variable  mediates the effect of HPWS on our outcome  measures.  To  establish  Path  a,  we  first  re- gressed  our  DEMS  measure  on  HPWS,  along  with  the  same  set  of  controls  used  in  our  models. Consistent with the correlation results  (where  DEMS  and  HPWS  correlate  at  r  ⫽  .381,  p  <  .001),  the  OLS  results  reveal  a  990  HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NOVEMBER–DECEMBER 2010 significant  association  (b  ⫽  .428,  p  <  .001).  Paths b and c are obtained from Models 1–6.  In  all  cases,  the  path  between  the  potential  mediator (DEMS) and the outcome variables  is  significant  (i.e.,  Path  b),  and  the  effect  of  HPWS on these outcome variables  (Path  c)  is  reduced.  A  formal  test  provides support for a partial me- diating  role  for  DEMS  in  the  HPWS-productivity  relationship  (Sobel  test  statistic  ⫽  1.602;  p  <  .10, one-tailed). We used Models 3  and 4 to perform a similar test for  the  innovation  outcome  measure  and  found  modest  support  for  a  mediating  role  for  DEMS  in  this  relationship (Sobel test statistic ⫽  1.557;  p  <  .10,  one-tailed).  Using  Models  5  and  6,  we  again  found  support  for  DEMS  partially  medi- ating  the  impact  of  HPWS  on  voluntary turnover (Sobel test sta- tistic ⫽ 1.800; p < .05, one-tailed). The organizations  in our sample that  used higher levels  of HPWS realized  higher performance,  and firms that  emphasized  diversity/equality  management in  addition to HPWS  achieved even more  gains. Discussion Our  study  reveals  that  increased  use of inclusive high performance  work systems (meaning a combination of tra- ditional  HPWS  and  diversity  and  equality  management systems) led to very real benefits  for both employers and employees in the or- ganizations  that  composed  this  study’s  sam- ple.  Consistent  with  previous  research  (e.g.,  Datta  et  al.,  2005;  Guthrie,  2001;  Huselid,  1995;  Way,  2002),  the  organizations  in  our  sample that used higher levels of HPWS real- ized higher performance, and firms that em- phasized  diversity/equality  management  in  addition to HPWS achieved even more gains.  Specifically, similarly to Jackson et al. (2003),  Kochan  et  al.  (2003),  and  Thomas  and  Ely  (1996),  our  analyses  indicate  that  firms  that  use DEMS demonstrate higher levels of labor  productivity, increased workforce innovation,  and decreased voluntary turnover. Moreover,  these effects are evident over and above those  associated  with  HPWS.  When  firms  used  HPWS  and  DEMS  in  tandem,  the  combina- tion explained 13.2% of the variance in labor  productivity,  8.8%  of  the  variation  in  work- force innovation, and 8% of the variance in  voluntary  employee  turnover.  Although  the  effect sizes in relation to DEMS alone appear  to be relatively small, when they are consid- ered in relation to the numbers of employees  and  annual  sales  turnover  of  these  firms,  in  many cases the monetary effect is quite large.  Using  our  OLS  models,  we  estimate  that  increasing  DEMS  from  “average”  to  “above  average”  (one  standard  deviation  above  the  mean) will, for the typical firm in our sample,   60,420.  increase  sales  per  employee  by  Moreover, while the association with increases  in labor productivity is important and signifi- cant, the increase in per-capita sales from new  products and services is particularly meaning- ful. This is because the future of organizations  depends on their ability to innovate and pro- duce  new  products  that  will  generate  future  sales.  It  is  also  important  not  to  underesti- mate  the  financial  implications  of  reducing  voluntary  employee  turnover.  Evidence  has  suggested  a  consistent  association  between  employee  retention  and  firm  success  (Shaw,  Gupta, & Delery, 2005). This study’s findings are important for sev- eral  reasons.  First,  although  the  diversity  imperative is widely discussed in the literature,  the empirical evidence in reality has suggested  that  diverse  groups  often  do  not  reach  their  full potential (Jehn & Bezrukova, 2003; Kochan  et  al.,  2003).  Our  findings  provide  empirical  evidence that effective diversity/equality man- agement  can  lead  to  measurable  monetary  benefits at the firm level. This would suggest  that  despite  some  concern  expressed  (CIPD,  2006; Jayne & Dipboye, 2004), investing in a  well-constructed  and  supported  DEMS  is  an  appropriate  use  of  resources.  This  finding  is  significant  in  that  developing  a  compelling  business  case  tends  to  lead  to  diffusing  such  practices  throughout  the  organization  more  quickly (Flood, Ramamoorthy, & Liu, 2003). Second, our findings enhance our under- standing of what factors are important in de- veloping  an  effective  DEMS.  Organizations  that manage diversity actively in a fair and ef- fective  way  (e.g.,  have  a  diversity  champion  within the organization, provide training, in- corporate diversity management in the firm’s  overall strategy, and have promotional tracking  Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm   THE IMPACT OF DIVERSITY AND EQUALITY MANAGEMENT ON FIRM PERFORMANCE  991 of  all  groups  in  the  organization)  are  more  likely to achieve positive outcomes. Much of  the  literature  on  diversity  has  indicated  that  diverse  groups  are  more  innovative  because  factors such as diverse perspectives and diverse  information  sources  can  enhance  creativity,  innovative  behavior,  and  decision  making  (Adler,  1997;  European  Commission,  2005;  Flood et al., 2001; Metcalf & Forth, 2000). This  literature, however, has also indicated that di- versity may also negatively impact employee  attitude, because some diverse groups may be  less  cohesive  and  more  prone  to  conflict  (Stephenson  &  Lewin,  1996).  Our  findings,  which suggest that organizations that manage  diversity effectively and fairly at all levels are  likely to reap benefits, are more positive. Thus,  this study’s findings, which agree with the ILO  (2006),  support  including  a  commitment  to  managing diversity and equality in definitions  of high performance work systems. Implications for Research Our  research  has  several  implications  that  merit  further  scientific  investigation.  First,  based  on  our  research, a  case  can  be  made  that  HPWS  should  be  expanded  to  include  measures  of  the  extent  to  which  organiza- tions practice diversity management, includ- ing  legal  compliance–related  measures  such  as  monitoring  fairness  in  recruitment  and  promotion  and  latent  cultural  aspects  that  measure  the  extent  to  which  the  firm  em- braces  a  culture  of  diversity  at  the  strategic  and operational levels. The fact that the In- ternational  Labour  Organization  (ILO)  has  recommended these same measures suggests  that it is an area well worth investigating in  contexts beyond Ireland. Second, while we have established cross- sectional  effects,  it  would  be  interesting  to  explore  the  effects  of  adopting  and  using  diversity  management  in  a  longitudinal  research  design.  Beyond  firm  performance,  it would be important to trace the impact of  diversity  management  on  employee-level  outcomes  such  as  satisfaction,  stress,  and  well-being.  The  exact  composition  of  a  diversity  management  index  is  another  area  of  potential  investigation,  as  are  the  Human Resource Management DOI: 10.1002/hrm Based on our  research, a case  can be made that  HPWS should  be expanded to  dimensions of which such an index may be  composed, if any. In  this  study,  we  conceptualized  HPWS  and  DEMS  as  related  but  distinct  parts  of  the same system—distinct because they are  composed  of  different  practices  and  likely  have  different  intermediate  effects,  but  related  because  our  bivariate  (correlation)  results demonstrate that they appear to co- vary to a certain extent. The OLS results also  suggest a fairly strong relationship between  the  two  such  that,  as  HPWS  in- creases,  so  does  DEMS.  Further  research  should  thus  investigate  the  exact  nature  of  the  relation- ship  between  these  two  con- structs  more  fully,  in  particular  exploring the possibility that HR  systems  and  diversity/equality  practices  may  have  complemen- tary or synergistic relationships. Diversity and equality manage- ment  could  legitimately  be  con- ceived  as  a  corporate  social  responsibility initiative. Thus, the  firm performance measures could  be  broadened  include  a  corporate  social  responsibility  orientation, which would involve  considering  firm/organization  performance  more  broadly,  rather  than  just  in  terms  of  the  bottom  line.  Specifically,  it  could take into account the social and ethi- cal effects of its activities on its staff and the  community around it. to  Implications for Practice HR managers can use these findings to argue  that  legally  complying  with  diversity  man- agement legislation has a positive economic  impact on firm performance. From a practice  and  policy  perspective,  this  is  a  significant  finding. Policy agencies charged with ensur- ing  compliance  with  EEO  legislation  now  have the evidence to prove that the diversity  and  equality  management  aspects  of  EEO  legislation should be seen less as a compliance  chore  and  more  as  a  performance- improvement  opportunity.  Bridging  the  theoretical and practical domains to build a  include measures  of the extent to  which organizations  practice diversity  management. 992  HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, NOVEMBER–DECEMBER 2010 Companies that  manage these  issues more  extensively  demonstrate higher  levels of business  convincing  case  for  investing  in  HR  is  a  perennial  problem  for  organizational  development specialists and human resource  directors.  While  considerable  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  ability,  motiva- tion,  and  opportunity  (AMO)  formula to predict employee per- formance,  it  has  rarely  been  interpreted  through  the  lens  of  diversity management. We believe  that  judiciously  managing  diver- sity will increase the human capi- tal inherent in “ability” and also  directly  link  “opportunity”  and  “motivation” to performance via  fairness  of  opportunity  in  recruitment  and  promotion.  Thus,  there  are  sound  practical  and  academic  reasons  for  our  research to assure and encourage  HR  professionals  that  diversity  management  is  important  for  organizational  performance.  We  believe our research provides the  foundation  for  evidence-based  management  that  practitioners  have been seeking for some time. performance,  and companies  that manage  these issues  using a coherent  management system  demonstrate even  greater effects in  terms of business  performance. Limitations Results  should  be  interpreted  cautiously  given  research  design  limitations.  These  data  were  col- lected  simultaneously;  therefore,  “causal”  relationships  may  be  reversed.  For  example,  the  measure  of  voluntary  turnover  asked respondents to report their current an- nual turnover rates, and these rates were “pre- dicted” by current HPWS and DEMS practices.  If respondents actually reported the previous  year’s  turnover  rates,  then  one  could  argue  that  our  design  and  data  are  “temporally  backward” (Way, 2002). While it is more plau- sible  to  argue  that  HR  systems  and  manage- ment  practices  influence  productivity,  workforce innovation, and turnover, it is cer- tainly possible that firms experiencing greater  success are better positioned to invest in these  HR  practices.  Second,  although  we  tested  non-response bias, whenever survey response  rates  are  less  than  100%,  bias  may  be  introduced into the data. Third, although we  explore  mediating  relationships  between  HPWS,  DEMS,  and  firm-level  outcomes,  we  do not explicate other relevant pathways (i.e.,  the  proverbial  black  box  problem  [Becker  &  Huselid, 2006; Macky & Boxall, 2007]. Conclusions Our results demonstrate a strong business case  for  building  management  systems  that  deal  effectively  with  issues  related  to  traditional  strategic human resources management, diver- sity,  and  equality.  Companies  that  manage  these  issues  more  extensively  demonstrate  higher  levels  of  business  performance,  and  companies  that  manage  these  issues  using  a  coherent  management  system  demonstrate  even greater effects in terms of business perfor- mance.  Specifically,  when  the  firms  we  sur- veyed used HPWS and DEMS in tandem, the  combined bundle explained 13.2% of the vari- ance in labor productivity, 8.8% of the varia- tion in workforce innovation, and 8% of the  variance  in  voluntary  employee  turnover.  Through our data analysis, we estimated that  increasing  DEMS  from  “average”  to  “above  average”  would,  for  the  typical  firm  in  our  sample,  increase  sales  per  employee  by  € 60,420. While  our  design  does  not  allow  us  to  claim  a  causal  relationship  between  our  expanded  set  of  high  performance  work  practices  and  business  performance  out- comes, we do provide useful insights for any  company  seeking  to  build  competitive  advantage  by  managing  people  effectively.  These results challenge public policy makers,  researchers,  and  management  practitioners  to  think  of  high  performance  management  practices in a more expansive way than has  been the norm until now. While traditional  HPWS will remain a core concern in terms of  “best  practices,”  our  results  suggest  that  companies  may  also  find  competitive  ad- vantage  through  more  effective  approaches  to managing employee diversity and equal- ity. Such issues should no longer be consid- ered a matter of regulatory compliance, but  as  management  policies  with  the  potential  to impact firm performance positively.

Because  the  HPWS,  DEMS,  and  turnover  data  were  all  obtained  from  a  single  source,  we  con- ducted  Harman’s  one-factor  test  (Podsakoff  &  Organ, 1986) to assess the degree to which inter- correlations among the variables might be an ar- tifact  of  common  method  variance.  Common  method variance is indicated if either (1) a single  factor  emerges  or  (2)  a  general  factor  accounts  for  a  majority  of  the  variance. These  conditions  were  not  observed,  thus  mitigating—but  not  eliminating—concerns  common  method bias. regarding  2. We  thank  an  anonymous  reviewer  for  suggesting  this possibility.
