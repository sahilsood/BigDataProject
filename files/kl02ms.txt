We propose that man- agers underestimate the full value of some means of pollution reduction and so under exploit these means. Based on evidence from previous studies, we argue that waste pre- vention often provides unexpected innovation offsets, and that onsite waste treatment often provides unexpected cost. We use statistical methods to test the direction and signiﬁcance of the relationship between the various means of pollution reduction and proﬁtability. We ﬁnd strong evidence that waste prevention leads to ﬁnancial gain, but we ﬁnd no evidence that ﬁrms proﬁt from reducing pollution by other means. Indeed, we ﬁnd evidence that the ben- eﬁts of waste prevention alone are responsible for the observed association between lower emissions and proﬁtability. (Environmental Strategy; Waste Prevention; Information Economics) Historically, scholars have argued that discretionary reductions in pollution by ﬁrms should lead to lower ﬁnancial performance (Friedman 1970). According to this view, the cost of pollution is borne by the pub- lic. Reducing this public harm represents philan- thropy, not proﬁt maximization. Recently, however, some scholars have argued that pollution reduction provides both a public and a private beneﬁt (Hart 1995, Porter and van der Linde 1995, Russo and Fouts 1997). Reducing pollution may increase pro- duction efﬁciency, increase demand from environ- mentally sensitive consumers, discourage stakeholder activism, and allow a ﬁrm to attract better workers (Reinhardt 1999). The dispute over whether and where it “pays to be green” is more than simply a debate over the private cost of pollution: It is a debate about whether managers systematically miss proﬁt oppor- tunities. Whatever the private cost of pollution, ratio- nal managers should choose the level of pollution that balances the costs and beneﬁts (McWilliams and Siegel 2001). Beyond this level, additional pollution reduction should reduce proﬁts. As Palmer et al. (1995) note, a viable “pays to be green” theory must explain why “[the private sector] systematically overlooks proﬁtable opportunities” (p. 91). Most scholars argue that managers tend to underes- timate one particular method of pollution reduction— waste prevention (Majumdar and Marcus 2001, Klassen and Whybark 1999, Hart 1995, Porter and van der Linde 1995). They argue that preventing waste (as opposed to treating waste once produced) provides unexpected and valuable information about process improvement opportunities. According to these schol- ars, such process improvements may more than offset the cost of pollution reduction (Ashford and Heaton 1983, Porter and van der Linde 1995). While central to most “pays to be green” argu- ments, this provocative idea has not been directly tested. A number of scholars have found evidence that less-polluting ﬁrms have higher ﬁnancial perfor- mance (e.g., Hart and Ahuja 1996). Scholars have also uncovered evidence that waste prevention, in partic- ular, can provide unexpected learning beneﬁts (King 0025-1909/02/4802/0289$5.00 1526-5501 electronic ISSN Management Science © 2002 INFORMS Vol. 48, No. 2, February 2002 pp. 289–299 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:52 .

In this paper, we disaggregate pollution reduction into its component factors and jointly test for the proﬁtability of each factor. We account for unobserved differences among ﬁrms to determine if the link between pollution reduction methods and ﬁnancial performance is real or merely an artifact of some other ﬁrm attribute. In our analysis, we ﬁnd support for the “pays to be green” hypothesis, but we show that this ﬁnding is likely caused by one factor alone—increased waste prevention. Theory and Hypotheses Firms can reduce their pollution in a number of ways. Firms may reduce their emissions by treating waste onsite, transferring waste to a third party pro- cessor, or by preventing waste at the source (often referred to as source reduction or pollution preven- tion). A proﬁt-maximizing manager should choose among these means of pollution reduction so that the ratio of the marginal productivity of each activity to the cost of that activity is the same. As a result, for a proﬁt-maximizing ﬁrm, the marginal cost of reducing a unit of pollution will be the same for all pollution reduction options and equal to the marginal beneﬁt of pollution reduction. However, if information about the value of each pollution reduction factor is costly to acquire, some factors may be under exploited while others may be overused. Theories of information search propose that prior expectations combined with costly infor- mation acquisition can cause managers to under (or over) invest in some forms of process improvement (Arrow 1974, von Hippel 1994). Absent new infor- mation, managers’ prior expectations determine the location and intensity of search for proﬁtable oppor- tunities (Arrow 1974, Jensen 1982). If managers expect little beneﬁt from certain pollution reduction strate- gies, they may not search for such proﬁtable pollution reduction opportunities, and thus, may not ﬁnd them. Research has shown that differences in search costs can inﬂuence the degree to which managers exploit other production techniques like lean production and quality management (Ocana and Zemel 1996). Juran (1988) argues that managers underestimate the value of total quality management (TQM) because infor- mation about the value of defect reduction is often both delayed and obscured (Juran 1988). On the other hand, the value of catching and ﬁxing defects at the end of the line is clear (e.g., doing so allows the ﬁrm to meet customer requirements). As a result, man- agers often overuse rework departments to ﬁx quality problems at the end of the line and underuse practices that improve quality in the production process (Flynn and Schroeder 1995). Womack et al. (1990) argue that the difﬁculty of observing the true value of lean pro- duction and TQM practices delayed their diffusion for years. During this time, managers who understood the value of such practices could improve their ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial performance by improving process quality and reducing end of line quality control. Similarly, a number of authors argue that waste prevention provides hard-to-observe beneﬁts and thus is underexploited (Hart and Ahuja 1995, Klassen and Whybark 1999, Russo and Fouts 1997). Waste prevention requires both conceptual and operational learning (Larpe et al. 2000). Cebon (1992) argues that the “contextual embeddedness” of waste pre- vention makes it difﬁcult for managers to measure its full value. King (1999) ﬁnds that while waste prevention improves worker incentives and encour- ages development of worker skills, these beneﬁts are often overlooked. Hart (1995) argues the beneﬁts of waste prevention are distributed and thus difﬁ- cult to attribute to waste prevention. Other scholars argue that unexpected synergies may exist between waste prevention and lean production techniques (Rothenberg 1999, King and Lenox 2001). Increased process innovation is often cited as an example of unexpected beneﬁt from waste preven- tion (Porter and van der Linde 1995). Ashford and Heaton (1983) argue that managers often overlook the abundant innovations from waste prevention. Berube et al. (1992) provide an explanation for this oversight. They argue that waste prevention allows improved measurement of the production process, and thereby facilitates process innovation. They describe one strik- ing example where mandated waste prevention led to numerous unexpected and highly proﬁtable process- improving innovations. King (1995) shows that, in industry, pollution prevention the printed circuit 290 Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 2, February 2002 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:52 .

Porter and van der Linde (1995) argue that these innovation offsets are often hard to link to their source, and thus, managers underestimate the value of the underlying process that engendered them. If managers do not factor in the value of such innovation, they will underinvest in waste prevention, and those ﬁrms that increase their investment in such activities will improve their ﬁnan- cial performance. Hypothesis 1. The more a ﬁrm prevents waste, the higher its ﬁnancial performance. While waste prevention may provide unexpected beneﬁts, several scholars have argued that waste treatment activities often entail unexpected costs (Cebon 1992, Hart 1995). The idea that end-of- pipe treatment might entail hidden costs derives from Thompson’s (1967) argument that organizational buffers both insulate the ﬁrm from disturbances and reduce the information ﬂowing to managers. Cebon (1992) extends this argument by suggesting that waste treatment activities reduce the incentives to improve the production process. Waste-processing operations allow the ﬁrm to continue to engage in sloppy prac- tices and then clean up the resulting problems “at the end of the pipe” (Cebon 1992, Hart 1995). King (1999) ﬁnds evidence that managers in one industry system- atically overinvested in waste treatment activities and that reduction in the size and capacity of these end-of- pipe operations encouraged waste treatment person- nel to improve the process itself. If managers overlook the hidden cost of waste treatment, they will choose to do more onsite waste treatment than is economical. Hypothesis 2. The less a ﬁrm treats waste onsite, the higher its ﬁnancial performance. Data and Measures Our sample is drawn from publicly traded U.S. man- ufacturing ﬁrms that are both listed in the Compus- tat database and have at least one facility that meets the reporting requirements of the U.S. EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). Facilities must complete TRI reports if they manufacture or process 25,000 pounds of any listed chemical during a calendar year, use more than 10,000 pounds, and employ 10 or more full-time people. Prior to 1991, ﬁrms did not pro- vide detailed information about waste generation or waste-processing onsite, thus we cannot use data from the years 1987–1990. At the initiation of this paper, 1996 was the last year of reported data. By matching the two sets, we created an unbalanced sam- ple of 614 ﬁrms constituting 2,837 ﬁrm-year observa- tions for the years 1991–1996. Financial Performance We measure ﬁnancial performance in two ways: return on assets (ROA) and Tobin’s q. ROA is a stan- dard accounting measure of ﬁnancial performance found commonly in strategy research. ROA is calcu- lated by dividing earnings before interest by average total ﬁrm assets. We use Tobin’s q in addition to ROA, because Tobin’s q better reﬂects the inherent value of the ﬁrm. Tobin’s q reﬂects expected future gains and is in accordance with more recent “pays to be green” studies (see Dowell et al. 2000). We calculated Tobin’s q by dividing the sum of ﬁrm equity value, book value of long-term debt, and net current liabil- ities by total assets (see Chung and Pruitt 1995). We do not use the more complicated measure of Tobin’s q as proposed by Lindenberg and Ross (1981), because past research has found little qualitative difference between this measure and the simpliﬁed version used in this analysis (Chung and Pruitt 1995). Pollution Reduction Previous research has measured ﬁrm pollution by dividing annual ﬁrm emissions of toxic chemicals by ﬁrm size (Hart and Ahuja 1996). We improve on this measure by analyzing performance at the facility level and by separating out the various means of pollution reduction. By comparing performance at the facility level, we can better control for industry effects. By dis- tinguishing among waste prevention and onsite and offsite waste treatment, we can explore where proﬁt opportunities lie. To measure each facility’s emissions, we sum releases of the 246 “core” toxic chemicals that have been consistently reported in the U.S. EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory. We weigh each chemical by its tox- icity using the Reportable Quantities (RQ) list in the Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 2, February 2002 291 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:52 .

To mea- sure the ﬁrm’s total pollution, we create a ﬁrm-level variable (total emissions) by taking the natural log of the total toxicity weighted emissions across all of a ﬁrm’s facilities. Total emissions are the outcome of a ﬁrm’s waste generation and its efforts to reduce this waste by prevention and treatment. Creating measures of each of these requires several steps. We ﬁrst measure the total toxic waste generated at a facility in a given year by calculating the toxicity-weighted sum of all core chemicals released into the environment, treated onsite, and transferred offsite. Next, we estimate a quadratic function between facility size and total waste generation for each 4-digit Standard Industry Classiﬁcation (SIC) code within each year using stan- dard OLS regression. Wit = e(cid:6)jt s(cid:9)1jt ln Wit = (cid:6)jt + (cid:9)1jt(cid:10)ln sit(cid:11)+ (cid:9)2jt(cid:10)ln sit(cid:11)2 + (cid:12)jt(cid:13) ln(cid:10)s(cid:11)∗(cid:9)2jt it (1) (2) e(cid:12)jt s it where Wit is aggregate waste generated for facility i in year t, sit is facility size, (cid:6)jt, (cid:9)1jt, and (cid:9)2jt are the estimated coefﬁcients for sector j in year t, and (cid:12)jt is the residual. We use the estimated function to predict the amount of waste each facility would generate given its size, industry, and year. We use the residual to measure the relative performance of each facility in reducing this waste generation. it = e(cid:6)jt s(cid:9)1jt W ∗ it S RWit = −e(cid:12)jt /(cid:17)(cid:12)jt (cid:13) ln(cid:10)s(cid:11)∗(cid:9)2jt it (3) (4) where W ∗ it is predicted waste generation for facility i in year t, RWit is the standardized relative perfor- mance for facility i in year t, and (cid:17)(cid:12)jt is the standard error of the residual for the SIC and year pair. We use the exponential form of the equation because we wish to sum these estimates for all facilities in ﬁrm before taking the log. We standardize the residuals to reﬂect the relative conﬁdence of different estimations and we change the sign of the residual so that positive scores indicate more waste prevention. Unweighted aggre- gations and nonstandardized residuals deliver similar results. Our ﬁnancial performance measures are at the cor- porate level, so we must aggregate our facility level data up to the company level. Waste generation is calculated as the sum of predicted waste generation (W ∗ it) across all facilities owned by a ﬁrm. Essentially, this is our best guess for how much waste the com- pany would have generated if it were an average per- former for its size in its industry. Waste prevention is the weighted average of a ﬁrm’s facility-level scores (RWit) based on the percentage of total production that each facility represents for the company. We also construct measures of relative waste treat- ment. We ﬁrst calculate the ratio of the material treated onsite (e.g., treated, burned, or recycled) to the total waste generated. We then calculate the aver- age and standard deviations for these amounts for each SIC code in each year. From this, we calculate a deviation for each facility. These deviations are then summed to form a ﬁrm measure of onsite manage- ment (waste treatment). Similarly, waste transfer mea- sures the percentage of waste that is processed offsite and is calculated in the same way. Controls We include a number of measures commonly used in the analysis of ﬁnancial performance as controls (e.g., Berger and Ofek 1995). A company’s size (ﬁrm size) is calculated as the log of the company’s assets. The amount a ﬁrm is growing (growth) is calculated as the annual percent change in sales. The capital intensity (capital intensity) of the ﬁrm is calculated by dividing capital expenditures by sales. The degree to which the ﬁrm is leveraged (leverage) is expressed as the ratio of its debt to assets. Finally, the research and develop- ment intensity of the ﬁrm (R&D intensity) is calculated by dividing research and development expenses by total assets. In addition to these common ﬁnancial controls, we also include an estimate of a ﬁrm’s labor prices in our regressions (regional wages). Because employees were used as a proxy for facility level production, differ- ences in labor efﬁciency among the ﬁrms in our study might bias our analysis. Lower labor prices would encourage managers to substitute labor for waste. For example, managers could hire workers to search for problems, engage in maintenance, or improve existing 292 Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 2, February 2002 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:52 .

These lower labor prices would also reduce the marginal cost of production and increase proﬁts. To rule out this rival explanation, we gathered infor- mation on annual state-level labor prices for unskilled labor from the county business pattern database of the U.S. Census Department. We create our measure by calculating the weighted average of state labor prices of all the states in which a ﬁrm has facilities operating. regulation varies across regions and imposes greater or lesser penalties for pollution. We measure a state’s regulatory stringency by calculating the inverse of the log of state toxic emissions divided by total employees in four main polluting industries: chemicals, petroleum, pulp and paper, and materials processing (Meyer 1995). We cre- ate a ﬁrm-level measure, regulatory stringency, by cal- culating the weighted average of the state regulatory stringency of all the states in which a ﬁrm has facil- ities operating. We created an alternative measure of regulatory stringency, permits, by summing the num- ber of federal waste water and hazardous waste per- mits possessed by a ﬁrm. In Table 1, we present summary statistics for each of our measures. In Table 2, we present the pairwise correlation matrix for our measures. Please note that the sample is smaller for ROA than for Tobin’s q. This is primarily a result of missing data on ﬁrm income levels. Misreported data caused elimination of 29 observations where ROA was more than ﬁve stan- dard deviations away from the mean. Analysis and Results We hypothesize that some types of pollution reduc- tion activities directly affect a ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial per- formance. However, it is possible that other ﬁrm attributes jointly affect both a ﬁrm’s pollution reduction activities and its ﬁnancial performance (Christmann 2000). It is difﬁcult to include all of the possibly confounding ﬁrm attributes in statis- tical analysis; we use a ﬁxed-effects regression to account for unobserved differences among our ﬁrms that might truly explain ﬁnancial performance. The ﬁxed-effect speciﬁcation allows each ﬁrm to have a separate intercept and, thus, has the attractive prop- erty that it controls for stable ﬁrm attributes like the date of ﬁrm founding. In essence, a ﬁxed-effect regres- sion requires that changes in independent variables (rather than their baseline level) be associated with changes in dependent variables. Fixed effects, along with our use of lagged dependent variables, allow us to argue that changes in our independent vari- ables are associated with and precede changes in our dependent variables. We estimate a number of models over the entire panel controlling for both ﬁrm and year ﬁxed effects Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 2, February 2002 293 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:52 .

In Models 1 and 2, we ﬁnd that lower emissions (total emissions) are signiﬁcantly associated with higher ﬁnancial performance as measured by future Tobin’s q and future ROA. We therefore cor- roborate Hart and Ahuja’s (1996) ﬁnding that reduced emissions are correlated with future ﬁnancial perfor- mance. Our ﬁndings are consistent with the general ﬁndings of the empirical “pays to be green” literature (e.g., Russo and Fouts 1997, Klassen and Whybark 1999, Cohen et al. 2000). Next, we explore by what means such reductions occurred (see Table 3). To explore the locus of prof- itable pollution reduction, we disaggregate pollution reduction into its component parts (waste generation, waste prevention, waste treatment, and waste transfer). In combination, these separate measures explain over 90% of total emissions. Regressing these measures on future Tobin’s q, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant, positive rela- tionship with waste prevention (Model 3). We also ﬁnd a signiﬁcant, positive relationship between waste pre- vention and future ROA (Model 4). We ﬁnd no evi- dence in either model that onsite waste treatment or offsite transfer is associated with ﬁnancial perfor- mance. Our ﬁxed-effects analysis helps reduce the effect of unobserved heterogeneity, but it does not demon- strate the direction of causality. For example, man- agers may invest in waste prevention when they have an unusually proﬁtable year. We extend our analysis by performing a test for Granger causal- ity (see Table 4). Granger causality may be inferred when the lagged dependent variable is included in a regression and the independent variables continue to have explanatory power (Greene 1993, Granger 1969). In Model 5, we ﬁnd a moderately signiﬁcant posi- tive relationship between waste prevention and future Tobin’s q in a model that includes Tobin’s q as a regressor. In Model 6, we also ﬁnd a moderately signiﬁcant relationship between waste prevention and future ROA when including current ROA as a regres- sor.1 Thus, we ﬁnd support for Hypothesis 1. We note, however, that this more stringent model reduced the signiﬁcance of our waste prevention coefﬁcient esti- mates (from p < 0(cid:20)028 to p < 0(cid:20)05 in Table 3). This may be due to the reduction in our sample size as a result of including additional lagged variables. Models 7 and 8 explore the extent to which our measure of waste prevention explains the observed 1 Please note that in Models 5 and 6, we use an instrumental vari- ables approach proposed by Anderson and Hsiao (1982) to correct for potential serial correlation that may arise because of the lagged dependent variable. In this approach, heterogeneity is reduced by taking ﬁrst differences (Greene 1993). Two-year lagged values of the dependent variable are used as instruments. We also tested an alter- native method proposed by Arellano and Bond (1991) and found consistent results. 294 Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 2, February 2002 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:52 .

Since total emissions is the out- come of different pollution reduction measures, we use a two-stage-least squares (2SLS) speciﬁcation to compare the relative effect of emissions versus waste prevention on proﬁtability. We ﬁrst estimate total emis- sions as a function of waste generation, prevention, treatment, and transfer. We then estimate the effect of total emissions, waste prevention, and our control variables on ﬁnancial performance. The ﬁrst stage of the model predicts total releases based on opera- tional choices and industry. The second stage predicts proﬁts based on both releases and waste prevention. As shown in Models 7 and 8, we ﬁnd evidence that more waste prevention is associated with Tobin’s q and ROA, respectively. Controlling for the effect of waste prevention, we ﬁnd no evidence that pollution (total emissions) is associated with ﬁnancial performance.

Discussion In general, our analysis supports the “pays to be green” hypothesis. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant, negative relationship between ﬁrm emissions and ﬁnancial performance. More importantly, we show that ﬁrms underexploit one means of reducing pollution—waste prevention. We ﬁnd no evidence that managers underexploit other factors, or pollution reduction in total. Indeed, we ﬁnd evidence that the beneﬁts of waste prevention alone may be responsible for the association between lower emissions and proﬁtability. 296 Management Science/Vol. 48, No. 2, February 2002 Downloaded from informs.org by [152.15.47.133] on 03 February 2017, at 07:52 .

The U.S. regulatory environment is a rather unique one. Compared to European and Asian nations, U.S. regulators are less conciliatory. In countries with a more cooperative relationship between government and industry, managers may be more likely to explore the beneﬁts of pollution prevention and less likely to miss opportunities for proﬁtable pollution prevention. We hope that future research will test our ﬁndings in different institutional and regulatory environments. While we infer from our ﬁndings that managers underexploit opportunities for proﬁtable waste pre- vention, other rival hypotheses cannot be completely ruled out. We would ﬁnd similar results if (1) man- agers tend to invest in pollution prevention only when they already possess other valuable ﬁrm capa- bilities, and (2) the market does not fully value these other capabilities until they observe the ﬁrm pre- venting waste. If so, pollution prevention might act only as an indicator of existing underlying capabili- ties (Morrison and Siegel 1997). Pollution prevention may be part of a moving technological frontier and ﬁrms only jump to this frontier when it is in their interest to do so. Jumping to the new frontier then provides information to the market about the ﬁrm’s capabilities. Within this rival theory, our explanation may still have merit. Search costs and prior expectations may inﬂuence the valuation that managers place on reach- ing the new frontier. Alternatively, it may be that pol- lution prevention is often part of a bundle of activ- ities that are deployed together. For example, lean production and waste prevention may frequently be deployed together—making it difﬁcult to untangle the ﬁnancial effects of the entire bundle.2 Waste pre- vention may represent the observed part of a bun- dle of complementary activities that provide ﬁnancial gain. Such an analysis represents only a short walk from our claim that waste prevention provides hidden 2 To try to distinguish this particular bundle, we also estimated each ﬁrm’s participation in the ISO 9,000 quality standard and their max- imum inventory levels for listed chemicals. We found that inclusion of these variables did not change the signiﬁcance of our ﬁndings. ancillary beneﬁts. Nevertheless, we should be cau- tious in not overextending our ﬁndings. It is possible that a combination of fortuitous resources and man- agerial choice could cause the statistical results we observe. It is important to recognize that we do not directly measure what managers know or what manager’s expect to be the cost of identifying proﬁt opportu- nities. We infer these search costs and expectations by evaluating the use of pollution reduction factors. While we try to rule out other rival explanations for our observed results, our inability to actually measure expectations and search costs suggests the need for additional work at multiple levels of analysis. Conclusions The dispute over whether it “pays to be green” is more than simply a debate over the private cost of pollution. It is a debate about whether and when managers systematically miss proﬁt opportunities. Drawing upon theories of information search, we pro- pose that prior expectations combined with costly information acquisition can cause managers to under- exploit (or overexploit) some process factors and thus miss potential proﬁt opportunities. Lacking informa- tion on the locus of proﬁt opportunities, managers’ prior expectations may determine the location and intensity of search (Arrow 1974, Jensen 1982). In this study, we extend the “pays to be green” lit- erature by distinguishing among methods for reduc- ing emissions. We argue that the value of one method (pollution prevention) is hard to observe, while the cost of another (end-of-pipe waste treatment) is often obscured. As a result, we hypothesize that managers underexploit waste prevention and overexploit waste treatment. In a longitudinal analysis of U.S. manufac- turing ﬁrms, we ﬁnd evidence that waste prevention is indeed underused, and that ﬁrms can improve their ﬁnancial performance by engaging in more waste pre- vention. Our analysis reinforces the similarity between the- ories of waste prevention and quality. We extend theories developed to explain the effect of quality programs to argue that managers underestimate the beneﬁt of solving waste problems at their source.

More generally, we provide a frame- work for predicting when such proﬁt opportuni- ties are likely to go underexploited. We propose that costly information acquisition and prior expec- tations can determine where opportunities for prof- itable improvements go unexploited. In this paper, we propose that ﬁrms sometimes fail to adopt proﬁtable practices. One may be tempted to conclude from our analysis that government reg- ulation is needed to correct such market failure. This need not be the case. Governing authorities may gather information and provide statistics to managers to update their expectations about the proﬁtability of engaging in certain practices (Lenox 1999). In the environmental realm, the U.S. Environmental Protec- tion Agency has created a number of programs to inform businesses of the value of energy efﬁciency and waste minimization and to help them ﬁnd these opportunities (e.g., the Green Lights Program). Trade associations often try to provide such information to their member ﬁrms (King and Lenox 2000). Our research extends analysis of whether and when such programs are likely to be useful. In future research, we hope to further explore these types of information provision programs. Acknowledgments Both authors contributed equally to this paper.
