A Longitudinal Analysis of Satisfaction and Profitability Kenneth L. Bernhardt GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY Naveen Donthu GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY Pamela A. Kennett UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH ALABAMA Recently, significant attention has been focused on customer satisfaction. However, few studies link satisfaction with performance, and even fewer studies examine this link through the use of time-series data. In this study, a longitudinal analysis of satisfaction and performance for a national chain of fast-food restaurants is conducted. A total of 342,308 consumer responses, 3,009 employee responses, and 12 months of restaurant perfor- mance measures are analyzed. Whereas there is a positive and significant relationship between customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction in any one given time period, no significant relationship between customer satisfaction and performance, and employee satisfaction and performance, is uncovered in this cross-sectional analysis. However, the analysis of time-series data reveals that a positive and significant relationship exists between changes in customer satisfaction and changes in the performance of the firm. Therefore, the impact of an increase in customer satisfaction on profits, although obscured in the short run by many factors, is significantly positive in the long run. J BUSN RES 2000. 47.161–171. 1999 Elsevier Science Inc. Customer satisfaction has attracted significant attention from top management in many companies. Although research into this area is not new (Oliver, 1993; TARP, 1979, 1986), it has experienced a sudden surge, growing into a $100 million industry in the United States (Loro, 1992). In a survey of 700 top executives, 64% indicated that customer satisfaction was their number one priority. The other 36% indicated it was one of their top priorities (Shoultz, 1989). This sentiment has been echoed in other surveys of upper- level management (Band, 1988; Quinlan, Zemke, Snider, Re- inemunde, Ayling, Singh, Perkins, Antonini, and Loeb, 1991).

All rights reserved. 655 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10010 tional evidence of the importance that corporate America has placed on customer satisfaction (Blasier and Snyder, 1992). The interest in customer satisfaction extends beyond the United States. For example, in Sweden, customer satisfaction has been measured on the national level (Fornell, 1992; Ander- son and Sullivan, 1993; Anderson, Fornell, and Lehmann, 1994). Some concern has been expressed about the heavy empha- sis on customer satisfaction and whether or not it relates to bottom-line performance (Zeithaml, Parasuraman, and Berry, 1990). This concern may be well founded. Whereas customer satisfaction, and such related areas as service quality, have received significant attention in the marketing literature, this attention has not focused on modeling the impact of these constructs on profits or other performance measures (Zahorik and Rust, 1992). Instead, past research focused on such other issues as identifying key service attributes (e.g., Bitner, Booms, and Tetreault, 1990; Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry, 1985); selecting important attributes (e.g., Bolton and Drew, 1991; Rust and Zahorik, 1991); modeling the linkage between service programs and attitudes and/or behavior intentions (e.g., Oliver, 1980; Westbrook and Oliver, 1991; Cronin and Taylor, 1992); and modeling behavioral response to service programs (e.g., Rust and Zahorik, 1991; Woodside, Frey, and Daly, 1989). Few researchers have examined the link between satisfac- tion and performance measures. However, those who have (for example, see Rust and Zahorik, 1993; Rust, Zahorik, and Keiningham, 1995; and Boulding, Kalra, Staelin, and Zeithme, 1993), have taken a cross-sectional approach to examining the relationship (see Anderson, Fornell, and Lehmann, 1994 for an exception) and subsequently have found inconclusive results. This relationship has yet to be examined using multiple time frames. The use of longitudinal data when examining customer satisfaction and quality issues has long been advo- ISSN 0148-2963/00/$–see front matter PII S0148-2963(98)00042-3 (cid:211) (cid:211) 162 J Busn Res 2000:47:161–171 K.

Relationship between customer satis- faction, employee satisfaction and profits/sales (based on previous studies). cated by academics and practitioners (e.g., LaBarbera and Mazursky, 1983; Oliver, 1993; Rust and Zahorik, 1993; Schneider, 1991; Zeithaml, Parasuraman, and Berry, 1990). Until this relationship is examined from a long-term perspec- tive, the real importance of customer satisfaction may not be fully appreciated. The contribution of this study is that it reexamines the relationship between satisfaction and performance and clari- fies the confusion surrounding it by examining the relationship in a longitudinal setting. Specifically, a theoretical background highlighting past research linking satisfaction with perfor- mance and reasons for the inconclusive findings in this area are presented. Once an understanding of the appropriate lon- gitudinal framework for examining customer satisfaction and its relationship with employee satisfaction and performance is established, appropriate hypotheses are presented, and the methodology and findings of the study are furnished. Finally, in the discussion section, the conclusions and limitations are presented along with managerial and research implications of the study findings. Theoretical Background and Hypotheses A small core of empirical work has been conducted linking satisfaction and performance (Zahorik and Rust, 1992). These studies, taken in aggregate, explore three major relationships. Figure 1 highlights these relationships: (1) the relationship between customer satisfaction and profits; (2) the relationship between employee satisfaction and profits; and (3) the re- lationship between customer satisfaction and employee satis- faction. Customer Satisfaction and Profits Mixed results have been found for the relationship between customer satisfaction and bottom-line performance in any given time period. Intuitively, its seems that this relationship should be positive and that the higher the customer satisfac- tion, the more favorable the performance measures. In fact, such researchers as Nelson, Rust, Zahorik, Rose, Batalden, and Siemanski (1992) have found that this positive relation- ship exists and have shown that it holds for all profitability measures—earnings, net revenues, and return on assets. However, many researchers have drawn opposite conclu- sions. Schneider (1991, p. 154), in his review article on service quality and profits, surmises “customer service-quality percep- tions and satisfaction are sometimes, but not always, reflected in profits.” Tornow and Wiley (1991) found a negative correla- tion between customer satisfaction and gross profits. In an- other study, Wiley (1991) concluded that all dimensions of customer satisfaction related negatively to financial perfor- mance. Although these findings might seem counterintuitive, on closer examination, they may not be that surprising. In any given time period, a multitude of factors could mask the true relationship between these constructs. For example, a business might decide that increasing its customer satisfaction is important, but in doing so, it has to spend a large sum of money to implement this. This could result in high customer satisfaction, but lower profit. Or perhaps severe weather might keep a large number of customers homebound for several weeks. Although those customers who venture out could be the most satisfied, overall sales might be poor. Conversely, internal cost-cutting measures might be taken that will make a firm seem more profitable in any given time period, even if customers are not satisfied. Satisfaction and Profitability J Busn Res 2000:47:161–171 163 Given the fact that many actions of the firm that are beyond the scope of customer satisfaction have such a tremendous impact on profits in any given time period, the significant positive relationship previously discussed seems to be the exception and not the rule, and therefore given the equivocal findings, an insignificant relationship is hypothesized. H1: There is an insignificant relationship between profit/ sales in time period t and customer satisfaction at time period t. Although the conclusions above concern the relationship between customer satisfaction and financial performance, con- clusions have also been drawn concerning the relationship between customer satisfaction and nonfinancial performance. Tornow and Wiley (1991) uncovered a positive relationship between customer satisfaction and nonfinancial performance measures such as right-the-first time and customer retention. This is opposite to their conclusion concerning financial per- formance. Schneider (1991) also found a positive relationship between customer satisfaction and performance when nonfi- nancial measures were considered. Furthermore, Cronin and Taylor (1992) explored the rela- tionship between service quality and customer satisfaction and their subsequent effects on purchase intentions and concluded that perceived service quality leads to satisfaction, and that satisfaction, in turn, had a significant positive effect on pur- chase intent. Dabholkar and Thorpe (1994), Rust and Zahorik (1993), Oliver and Swan (1989), Bearden and Teel (1983), LaBarbera and Mazursky (1983), Swan and Trawick (1981), Oliver (1980), and Swan (1977) also found support for this relationship between satisfaction and purchase intentions. Boulding, Kalra, Staelin, and Zeithaml (1993) examined the effects of perceived service quality on behavioral intention. Expectations and the delivered service influenced perceived service quality, which in turn, had an impact on behavioral intentions such as willingness to provide favorable word-of- mouth and to engage in repeat business. It is, therefore, hy- pothesized that: H2: There is a positive relationship between customer sat- isfaction at time period t and behavior intent at time period t. Employee Satisfaction and Profits Equally mixed results were found concerning the relationship between customer satisfaction and profits; mixed results were also found concerning the relationship between employee sat- isfaction and profits. When examining the relationship, Schneider (1991) drew a conclusion almost identical to his conclusion concerning the relationship between customer satisfaction and profitability, “frequently, but not always, em- ployee data are reflected in unit profitability (p. 154).” Paradise-Tornow (1991) concluded that overall employee satisfaction was positively related to financial performance measures. Satisfied employees, one could argue, should be more motivated and harder working than dissatisfied ones. This effort should be reflected in the company’s performance. However, other researchers have failed to replicate these find- ings in similar cross-sectional studies. For example, Tornow and Wiley (1991) found a consistent negative relationship between employee satisfaction (with such items as pay and benefits) and gross profit. Furthermore, Wiley (1991) concluded the relationship between overall em- ployee satisfaction and financial performance was “virtually nonexistent.” He did, however, find a negative relationship between financial performance and employees’ satisfaction with training and standard processes. Just as with customer satisfaction and financial performance, the true relationship between employee satisfaction and financial performance may also be masked by any number of factors in any given time period. Employees might be happy, because their company has invested money in employee benefits or improvements that have an impact on the employee but not the customer, resulting in a short-term profit reduction. Or, in an economic downturn, employees might be happy to even have a job at the same time as sales are down. Thus, given the equivocal findings, the following hypothesis is proposed: H3: There is an insignificant relationship between em- ployee satisfaction at time period t and profit/sales in time period t. Customer Satisfaction and Employee Satisfaction The relationship between customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction is the one relationship that does not seem to yield conflicting results. In a summary of the research to date, Schneider (1991) concluded that employee and customer sat- isfaction are positively correlated. This positive correlation holds across numerous industries and in both consumer and business-to-business settings. Schlesinger and Zornitsky (1991) found that this relationship gets stronger as employees increase in tenure. This relationship has been explicitly explored by both Tor- now and Wiley (1991) and Wiley (1991), with almost identical findings. A strong relationship was found between customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction when satisfaction was measured for service-oriented aspects of the company. This is not surprising, given that employees and customers are usually involved in the coproduction of the services. However, when satisfaction concerning such things as pay and benefits was measured from an employee standpoint, a weak relation- ship was found between customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction. Schneider and his colleagues (1980, 1985, 1991) reinforce the positive relationship between employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction. Specifically, when employees reported that service was a priority in their respective companies and spoke positively of the companies’ human resource practices, 164 J Busn Res 2000:47:161–171 K. L. Bernhardt et al. customers reported higher service quality. Also, employee behavior could be predicted by customer perceptions, and customer behavior could be predicted by employee percep- tions. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed: The goal of this paper is to re-examine the cross-sectional hypotheses that were the focus of most of the previous research in customer satisfaction and then to extend this previous research through the use of time series analysis. H4: There is a positive relationship between customer sat- isfaction at time period t and employee satisfaction at Method time period t. Longitudinal View As previously suggested, the conflicting relationships between customer satisfaction and performance (profits or sales) and employee satisfaction and performance may be attributable to the fact that in all these studies cross-firm data collected at one point in time (cross-sectional data) were analyzed. Cross- firm data over time (time-series data) have not been examined to date. A positive relationship between customer satisfaction and performance may not appear in the short-run or through the examination of cross-sectional data. The relationship may only become apparent through the use of time-series data (Zeithaml, Parasuraman, and Berry, 1990, pp. 8–9). This same rationale applies to the relationship between employee satis- faction and profits. Often, efforts to increase employee satisfac- tion will not bring about an immediate increase in profits, but will eventuate in profits (Schneider, 1991). Time-series data are unique, because they allow a firm to compare itself with itself over time, and to notice the impact of satisfaction alone on performance (assuming other factors, such as location, do not change over time). Cross-sectional data, on the other hand, can be misleading, because at that point, the firm is comparing itself with other firms, whose performance may fluctuate because of factors other than satis- faction alone (e.g., location, traffic, promotional considera- tions, and weather conditions). The use of cross-sectional data also reflects the fact that short-run costs are often incurred when trying to improve satisfaction. In the long run, the impact of these costs is softened. In addition, it may take some time for a company’s efforts to increase customer satisfaction is rewarded by con- sumer behavior. As stated in H2, customer satisfaction and behavioral intention are positively related. However, the con- sumer’s behavioral intention may not be carried out until future time periods. Although the consumer’s satisfaction in time period t will have an impact on behavioral intention in time period t, it may not have an impact on behavior and, as a result, the financial performance of the firm, until time period t 1 n. Therefore, it is purported that the true impact of satisfaction on performance measures is not apparent when taking a cross- sectional approach. A longitudinal view seems to be necessary. Hypotheses 5 captures this longitudinal orientation. H5: There is a positive relationship between a change in customer satisfaction in previous time periods and a change in current profits/sales. The data for this study come from three independent sources and consist of customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and performance information for a national chain of fast- food restaurants. Collection of these data was spurred by the restaurant chain’s initiative in 1992 of a customer/employee satisfaction-measurement program, which was one compo- nent of the over-all quality audit. The first set of data, concerning customer satisfaction, comes from a series of surveys conducted at each local restau- rant of the chain. Customers from 472 restaurants were sur- veyed during the time period March 1992 to March 1993. The total sample size was 342,308. The surveys were conducted in each restaurant every other month with approximately 100 questionnaires per restaurant, per data collection period ob- tained. The data collection was conducted by a national mar- keting research firm, and professional interviewers were used to collect the data. A sampling procedure was used that en- sured that various days of the week and times of day were represented in approximate proportion to sales volume. Customers were approached after they finished eating and were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire. After completing the questionnaire, the respondents returned it to the interviewer. The overall response rate was in excess of 90%. The questionnaire itself contained an overall measure of satisfaction (“Overall, how satisfied are you with your visit to today?”); evaluation of the restaurant on a series of nine quality attributes (e.g., “Please rate today’s visit to this restaurant on the factors listed below: (1) providing fast service, (2) cleanliness,” etc.); intention to visit the restaurant again in the future (“Based on today’s visit, what is the likeli- hood that you will eat at in the future”); and various measures such as time of day, day of week. To ensure a high response rate, it was important to keep the questionnaire very short. Therefore, no demographics were asked. Previous research conducted by the fast-food chain had indicated that there was very little variability among key measures by demo- graphics, thus justifying this decision. The second set of data, from employees of the fast-food restaurant, was collected separately. Each restaurant was sent a package of questionnaires, and the restaurant manager was asked to distribute these to all employees together with a postage-paid return envelope addressed to an independent research supplier. The employees were assured their responses would be treated anonymously, and, therefore, were asked to complete the questionnaire and return it directly. A total of 3,099 questionnaires were returned from 382 of the 472 res- taurants (average of eight per store with a range of 1 to 37). Satisfaction and Profitability J Busn Res 2000:47:161–171 165 Table 1.

There were no significant differences be- tween stores whose employees responded versus those with no employees responding with regard to such measures as sales, profits, and number of employees. The over-all response rate was approximately 30%. The employee satisfaction data were collected only once, about the same time as the first customer satisfaction data collection. Employees were asked their overall satisfaction as an em- ployee of the company, their perceptions of the company’s success in achieving its mission, ways the company could satisfy more customers, and a few demographic questions. The employee demographics included age, gender, and length of time employed at the company. These variables were se- lected, because the management, based on prior qualitative research, felt that they would have the biggest impact on employee satisfaction. The last set of data, concerning restaurant performance, was provided by the company. Several measures of perfor- mance for each restaurant were examined including sales, customer counts, and profitability. An identification number for each restaurant was used to link the three databases. Each of the questionnaires was extensively pretested. The first step in the pretest/questionnaire design was to develop an overall measure of customer satisfaction together with a number of individual attributes that represented attributes important in the determination of service quality. A series of focus groups was conducted to develop these measures. Consumers were asked to describe very positive experiences with fast-food restaurants and very negative experiences. The scenarios described were coded into such categories as overall quality of the food, speed of service, cleanliness of the restau- rant, freshness of the food. A large number of possible attri- butes were identified in this process. Another series of focus groups was then conducted during which this extensive list of attributes was narrowed down to the final list of nine attributes found in Table 1. Little difference in importance was identified among these nine attributes. Several alternative measures of overall satisfaction were pretested, including several numeric scales and several differ- ent overall satisfaction measures. Consumers liked the direct measure of very satisfied, satisfied, neither satisfied nor dissat- isfied, dissatisfied, or very dissatisfied. This scale was easy for respondents to understand, and there was little disagreement about the category descriptions. Furthermore, the scale chosen here is a common way of measuring customer satisfaction, and although numerous customer satisfaction scales exist (both single- and multi-item), no single scale seems to outperform the others (Peterson and Wilson, 1992). For example, one satisfaction scale may increase reliability and sensitivity, but decrase validity and utility, or vice versa (Peterson and Wil- son). Other researchers have acknowledged similar trade-offs when choosing among satisfaction scales, especially when con- sidering a single-item versus a multi-item scale (Parducci, 1965; Schwartz, Hipler, Deutsch, and Strack, 1985; Wedell and Parducci, 1988). Given all these considerations, coupled with the fact that the intent of the researchers was not to develop a new satisfaction measure, it was determined that the aforementioned measure of satisfaction was best suited for the study, given its simplicity and ease of use for the respondents. Findings The first step in the analysis was to investigate the relationship of the overall measure of customer satisfaction with the nine individual service quality attributes. Table 1 contains correla- tion coefficients measuring the relationship between each of the individual attributes and the over-all measure of customer satisfaction. The coefficients are all very close, ranging from 0.58 to 0.65, and significant. Therefore, the correlational evi- dence suggests that each attribute is important in explaining over-all customer satisfaction, and that poor performance by the chain on any one of the dimensions could cause a con- sumer to rate the chain low on over-all satisfaction. Exploratory factor analysis on the nine attributes resulted in four factors. Restaurant appearance, restaurant cleanliness, and employee appearance loaded on Factor 1 (Cronbach’s alpha 5 0.84). Consistency of food, quality of food, and freshness of food loaded on factor 2 (Cronbach’s alpha 5 0.82). Attentiveness of employees and speed of service loaded on factor 3 (Cronbach’s alpha 5 0.71). Received money’s worth, alone, loaded on Factor 4. These factors may be labeled as “appearance,” “food quality,” “employee factors,” and “value.” Although similarities exist, these factors seem to be more “context-specific” than the dimensions of SERVQUAL, which may be described as being more “general” in nature. Cross-Sectional Analysis The next step in the analysis was to examine the correlation between over-all customer satisfaction and performance mea- sures, and employee satisfaction and the same performance 166 J Busn Res 2000:47:161–171 K. L. Bernhardt et al. Table 2.

These results are presented in Table 2. The relation- ship between over-all customer satisfaction and several finan- cial performance measures is very weak (r 5 0.01 to 0.05). The same is true for employee satisfaction (r 5 0.05 to 0.07). These results support H1 and H3 and show that there is no significant (either positive or negative) relationship between satisfaction and performance in the same period. Previous research has shown a positive relationship be- tween customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction. The same result was found in this research. The correlation be- tween customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction was 0.53 (significant at the .05 level), and hence, support was found for H4. Next, to get another perspective on H4, as seen in Table 3, the 382 restaurants were divided into three categories based upon customer satisfaction scores. The first group, comprising about one-quarter of the restaurants, had over-all customer satisfaction scores at least 0.1 above the over-all chain average. The second category consisted of those restaurants (approxi- mately half) that had customer satisfaction scores within plus or minus 0.1 of the overall chain average. The third group consisted of restaurants with customer satisfaction scores at least 0.1 below the chain average. Although continuous analy- sis was used to test H4, this analysis was done at the request of the management, who generally prefer such discrete analyses. Mean employee satisfaction, measured using the same five- point satisfaction scale, was above average (4.4 versus average of 4.2) for those restaurants with higher than average customer satisfaction and was below average (4.0 versus average of 4.2) for those restaurants with below average customer satisfaction scores. This result was not simply an artifact of a small group of either very satisfied or very dissatisfied employees. More than three-quarters of the restaurants with above average em- ployee satisfaction also had above average customer satisfac- tion. Conversely, of the restaurants with below average cus- tomer satisfaction, only 21 percent had employee–customer satisfaction above average. Hence, this discrete analysis also shows a positive relationship between customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction. Hypothesis 2 states that, although a relationship may not be seen in performance measures, the impact of customer satisfaction is seen in behavioral intention measures. This study provides support for this hypothesis. Specifically, the correlation between mean over-all customer satisfaction and likelihood of returning to the restaurant is 0.68, providing strong support for H2. Apparently, customer satisfaction, al- though not influencing sales and profits immediately, does affect consumers’ intentions to return in the future. To summarize, the results show a significant positive rela- tionship between service quality attributes and over-all cus- tomer satisfaction, no significant relationship between cus- tomer satisfaction and financial performance measures, no significant relationship between employee satisfaction and fi- nancial performance measures, a significant relationship be- tween customer satisfaction and behavioral intent, and a signif- icant positive relationship between customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction at any one point in time (cross-sectional analysis). Time Series Analysis To examine H5, a change in customer satisfaction will be correlated with a change in financial performance, a time series analysis was conducted. Eight waves of customer satis- faction data were available, and it was decided to collapse these data into a base period and follow-up periods. The first Table 3.

The main reason for combining the data in this manner is that previous research has shown that there are minor fluctua- tions in customer satisfaction scores over short terms (Peterson and Wilson, 1992). Combining two waves into one measure may eliminate short-term fluctuations in these scores. The correlation between change in customer satisfaction (from t to t 1 1) and change in profits (from t 1 1 to t 1 2) was 0.42 (significant at the .05 level), thus supporting H5. Other correlations (e.g., change in customer satisfaction (from t 1 1 to t 1 2) and change in profits (from t 1 2 to t 1 3) produced similar significant results (correlation of 0.39), and, hence, we can safely conclude that our support for H5 is not an artifact of our specific base and follow-up measures. Although the correlation analysis views satisfaction and performance as continuous variables, at the recommendation of the restaurant management, a discrete (categorical) analysis was also performed. The restaurants were divided into three groups based on change in customer satisfaction scores. The groups were formed so that the group sizes were about the same. The first group, representing one-third of the restau- rants, were those with mean over-all customer satisfaction scores increasing by greater than 0.1 from t to t 1 1. The second group, consisting of almost one-third of the restau- rants, were those with stable mean over-all customer satisfac- tion scores, with a change of equal to or less than 0.1 over the two time periods. The final group of restaurants had over- all customer satisfaction decreasing by greater than 0.1 from the base period t to the follow-up period t 1 1. 1% above average, with 53% of these restaurants having profit increases above the chain average. For those restaurants with decreasing customer satisfaction, the average change in profits was 26% below the chain average, with only 20% of these having profit increases above the chain average. Interestingly, the mean starting customer satisfaction (at t) for all three groups was about the same, and there was no significant difference in the type of restaurants (e.g., mall unit, downtown unit, or free-standing unit) that comprised each group. In summary, a positive relationship between service attri- butes and customer satisfaction, lack of relationship between customer satisfaction and profit and employee satisfaction and profit, a positive relationship between customer satisfaction and behavior intent, and a positive relationship between cus- tomer satisfaction and employee satisfaction were reported using cross-sectional analysis. The additional finding, using time series analysis, is the positive relationship between the changing customer satisfaction in previous time periods and change in current profit/sales. The researchers also propose the following: P1: There is a positive relationship between a change in employee satisfaction in previous time periods and a change in current profits/sales. P2: There is a positive relationship between a change in customer satisfaction in previous time periods and a change in current employee satisfaction. However, no data were available to confirm these. Longitudi- nal data collection on employee satisfaction was not conducted and is left for future research. Figure 2 illustrates all the hypothesized/proposed relationships and summarizes the re- search findings. As shown in Table 4, the increase in average monthly profits was greatest for those restaurants with increasing customer satisfaction scores (1 9.8%) and lowest for those restaurants where customer satisfaction decreased (average monthly prof- Discussion its up 5.6%). The group with stable scores had profit increases right at the chain average. Put another way, those restaurants with an increase in customer satisfaction had profits 30% above chain average. Table 4 also shows that among restau- rants in this group, 83% had profit increases above chain average. Those with stable customer satisfaction had profits Conclusions and Limitations Customer satisfaction has had an intuitive appeal to manage- ment since it first surfaced as a topic in the academic literature. Satisfied customers should become loyal customers and attract other potential loyal customers, and this loyalty should be 168 J Busn Res 2000:47:161–171 K. L. Bernhardt et al. Figure 2.

For each of the relationships, the hypothesized effect is followed by the study’s finding in parentheses.

How- ever, research into this relationship between customer satisfac- tion and financial performance, and other closely related rela- tionships, has yielded conflicting and inconclusive findings. Could all this attention on customer satisfaction be only fad? Or does it actually have the impact that, intuitively, it seems it should have? This study shows that the latter is the case. Customer satisfaction is positively reflected in profits, but this relationship only becomes apparent through the examination of longitudinal data. A time series analysis of satisfaction and performance for a national chain of fast-food restaurants was conducted. By examining these relationships for only one time period t, we might erroneously conclude that customer satisfaction is, indeed, an unimportant managerial concern. As the results of this study indicate, although there is a positive relationship between customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction in any given time period, there is no relationship between cus- tomer satisfaction and profits/sales, and employee satisfaction and profits/sales. However, the true relationship between cus- tomer satisfaction and profits/sales emerges when changes in customer satisfaction and profits/sales are examined over a period of time, in this case, 12 months. Analysis of time-series data reveals that a positive relationship between changes in customer satisfaction and changes in the financial performance of the firm emerge and that customer satisfaction does, indeed, have the effect that initially spurred the interest in this research stream. This study has several other features in addition to the longitudinal assessment previously discussed. First, the re- search began with an analysis of the attributes that consumers deem important in the determination of service quality and, Satisfaction and Profitability J Busn Res 2000:47:161–171 169 impact of customer satisfaction programs.

Furthermore, financial performance at any one time period seems to be a function of several other factors (e.g., short-term sales promotions, economic, environmental, and firms-specific factors), instead of a function of customer satisfaction. Thus, a longer-term view is appropriate in evalu- ating the results of customer satisfaction programs. This study does have limitations. Data were not available to examine two propositions (P1 and P2). Given the parallels between employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction pre- viously discussed, it is the authors’ contention that future examination of these relationships will confirm the proposi- tions. The hypothesized relationships were examined in one spe- cific industry, thus limiting its generalizability. Although it is expected that this relationship will be found across industries, future research must verify that these findings are not germane only to the fast-food industry. Fast-food restaurants typically are independently owned and operated and, therefore, may have variability in their policies and procedures. In addition, food is an item for which there is substantial variability in preferences across geographical areas, such as greater prefer- ence for chicken in the southern part of the United States or greater preference for seafood in Southeast Asia, and this may have an impact on the results. With its heavy promotion orientation, fast-food restaurant visits may be more price- promotion driven than is typical. Finally, given extensive dis- tribution and presence virtually everywhere, more conve- niently located alternatives are available to consumers than is true for the typical retailer. Furthermore, no information was available on what strate- gies individual store operators used to increase satisfaction; hence, we cannot report what was driving changes in satisfac- tion. It is possible that the initiation of a satisfaction-measure- ment program and quality audit served as a motivator for store operators to increase satisfaction. Additionally, profits are a result of several factors including satisfaction. However, the investigation of these other factors was not conducted in this study. In many ways this is similar to the problem faced by advertising researchers who try to model sales as a function of advertising. Finally, this study utilized single-item indicators for three of the variables under consideration—customer satisfaction, employee satisfaction, and profitability/sales. As previously discussed, this form of measurement is viewed favorably by researchers. However, it does limit the analysis that could be conducted, and, as a result, certain analytical techniques (e.g., Lisrel), which could perhaps enhance the insights from the findings, could not be utilized. Managerial Implications There are a number of important managerial implications that can be derived from this study. The first, and most important, is that management should exercise patience in evaluating the Given the increase in profitability attributable to improving quality and customer satisfaction, it is easier to justify invest- ments in such programs. Thus, management should look more favorably upon such investments as improvements in technol- ogy, training, and any other undertakings that might raise consumers’ perceptions of customer satisfaction by raising their perceptions of the quality attributes that contribute to customer satisfaction. The evidence shows that there can be a good return on such investments over time. The results reported here imply that continuous improve- ment is a wise strategy. Of course, it is important to improve on those dimensions that are important to customers versus improvements that are not noticeable or relevant to customers. Therefore, considerable up-front investment geared to de- termining the attributes most relevant to improving customer satisfaction is justified. In the case of this chain of fast-food restaurants, continuous improvement on the nine service qual- ity attributes should be rewarded in the long term. Also, the results reported above confirmed previous find- ings that there is a positive relationship between employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction. Thus, investments in employee education and training should be worthwhile, also. It is important that employees understand the drivers of cus- tomer satisfaction, and training efforts should emphasize the attributes most important to customers. Although this study was not able to evaluate the relationship between employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction over time, it would seem reasonable that improvements in employee satisfaction could have delayed effects on customer satisfaction in the same way that improvements in customer satisfaction lead to increases in profitability over time. This relationship, however, must be confirmed through future research. Similarly, it is important to remember that attempts to increase customer satisfaction also may have a positive impact on employee satisfaction. If customers are satisfied, employees will not have to listen to complaints and may feel better about their jobs, leading to increased employee retention and reduction in the cost associated with hiring new employees. Thus, there may be an even further positive impact on profit- ability over time. Finally, customer satisfaction can be viewed as an advance 170 J Busn Res 2000:47:161–171 K. L.

Research Implications Because of the difficulty in obtaining longitudinal or time- series data, cross-sectional data are widely used in marketing research. However, as illustrated by this study, time-series may be valuable when attempting to uncover what is actually happening in the marketplace. Future researchers in all areas of marketing, not only in the area of satisfaction, should realize the richness of time-series data and consider their collection and use whenever possible. In addition, numerous research implications exist, specifi- cally for the satisfaction researcher. First, in an attempt to enhance the generalizability of the findings of this study, these same hypotheses and propositions should be explored in the context of other industries, not only in a consumer setting, but also in a business-to-business setting. Furthermore, repli- cations of this research using other fast-food restaurants would be useful. For the national chain of fast-food restaurants re- searched in this study, over-all customer satisfaction was very high and positively skewed. In other applications, where we might expect a higher variance in customer satisfaction, the longitudinal relationship between satisfaction and profitability might be even more prominent. Second, a 12-month (eight wave) longitudinal examination of the relationship between customer satisfaction and sales/ profits produced strong support for the importance of cus- tomer satisfaction. Future research calls for an examination of this relationship over longer periods of time with the belief that the support for the continued emphasis on customer satisfaction will be even more dramatic. Moreover, such exam- ination over longer periods of time will enable application of time-series analysis to uncover the time lag between increase in customer satisfaction and increase in sales. As outlined in the theoretical background, cross-sectional research dealing with the relationship between satisfaction and performance has yielded conflicting results. Researchers should attempt to explain these results by using covariates. This research will aid in identifying other factors affecting this relationship at a given point. Also, future researchers should employ multi-item con- structs, when possible. By using multi-item constructs, more sophisticated methods of analysis can be employed, thus building a stronger case for the importance of satisfaction. Researchers should also consider broader measures of per- formance beyond the financial measures of sales and profits. The focus of this research dealt with the link between satisfaction and financial performance. Future researchers might consider examining the link between each of the various quality attributes and performance. Perhaps certain attributes have a stronger impact on financial performance. Or, perhaps different lags exist for each of the attributes’ impact on perfor- mance. Finally, in situations in which satisfaction has declined and negatively affected financial performance, researchers should consider conducting a switching analysis. It would be benefi- cial to determine which consumers are defecting and causing this decline. Is it the loyal customers or infrequent customers who change their behavior when dissatisfied?
