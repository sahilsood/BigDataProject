KEEPING YOUR HEADCOUNT WHEN ALL ABOUT YOU ARE LOSING THEIRS: DOWNSIZING, VOLUNTARY TURNOVER RATES, AND THE MODERATING ROLE OF HR PRACTICES CHARLIE O. TREVOR ANTHONY J. NYBERG University of Wisconsin–Madison Although both downsizing and voluntary turnover have been topics of great interest in the organizational literature, little research addresses the topics’ possible relationship. Using organization-level data from multiple industries, we first investigate whether downsizing predicts voluntary turnover rates. Second, to support our causal model, we examine whether aggregated levels of organizational commitment mediate this rela- tionship. Third, we test whether the downsizing–turnover rate relationship is (1) mitigated by HR practices that either embed employees in their organization or convey procedural fairness and (2) strengthened by HR practices that enhance career devel- opment. Results support the hypothesized main, mediated, and moderated effects. Downsizing is commonplace today, with deploy- ment of the strategy constrained by neither com- pany financial health nor employee type (Cascio, 2002a). Given the enormous organizational, indi- vidual, and societal implications of downsizing, the phenomenon warrants, and is receiving, sub- stantial research attention. Much of the downsizing research involves effects on either employee atti- tudes or organizational performance. Researchers know very little, however, about downsizing effects on the critical employee behaviors that likely ac- company these attitudes and affect organizational performance. Perhaps the most telling of these be- haviors is voluntary employee turnover. For at least three reasons, assessments of down- sizing viability or success appear to be incomplete if turnover implications are not considered. First, companies undertake downsizing—a planned re- duction in their number of employees (Cascio, 1993)—to reduce headcount to some target level. Consequently, unexpected subsequent turnover es- sentially translates into missing that target and leaving the leaner organization understaffed, and thus hindered in its efficiency. Second, turnover- related financial costs, which include employee replacement, training, and outplacement (Cascio, 2000; Sturman, Trevor, Boudreau, & Gerhart, 2003) are quite high, with per-leaver estimates often dou- ble leaver salary (e.g., Johnson, 1995; Solomon, We thank Barry Gerhart for his invaluable assistance with this project. We also appreciate the insights of Sara Rynes and our three anonymous reviewers. 259 1988). Given that downsizing is undertaken pri- marily as a cost-cutting measure (Cascio, 1993, 2002b), incurring unforeseen expenses of this mag- nitude may jeopardize its success. Third, although evidence on the relationship between downsizing and organizational performance is mixed (Cappelli, 2000; Madrick, 1995), turnover rates may shed light on the dynamic. Chadwick, Hunter, and Walston (2004) found that the performance of hospitals that downsized appeared to benefit from the high-in- volvement human resource (HR) practices that sev- eral studies (e.g., Arthur, 1994; Batt, 2002; Guthrie, 2001; Huselid, 1995) have shown to reduce turn- over rates. Moreover, recent research indicates that turnover rates are negatively associated with busi- ness unit and organizational success (Glebbeek & Bax, 2004; Kacmar, Andrews, Rooy, Steilberg, & Cerrone, 2006; McElroy, Morrow, & Rude, 2001; Shaw, Gupta, & Delery, 2005). Thus, turnover rates, as well as the HR practices that affect them, may be key elements in understanding how, and when, downsizing influences organizational performance. The downsizing-turnover relationship is also of considerable interest from the perspective of vol- untary turnover research itself. Because more valu- able employees are more likely to facilitate organi- zational success, the field is becoming increasingly focused on their retention (e.g., Lavelle, 2003; Lee, Mitchell, Sablynski, Burton, & Holtom, 2004; Stur- man et al., 2003; Trevor, 2001; Trevor, Gerhart, & Boudreau, 1997). Hence, studying voluntary turn- over among downsizing survivors, who have been earmarked as the employees most worth keeping (Martin & Bartol, 1985), is especially relevant.

Despite the organizational performance and vol- untary turnover implications of downsizing, only one study (Batt, Colvin, & Keefe, 2002) has tested whether downsizing predicts voluntary turnover rates. Consequently, we used a broad sample to explore the relationship, the untested contention that organizational commitment mediates this as- sociation, and the extent to which the relationship depends on how organizations manage their hu- man resources. CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT AND HYPOTHESES Three issues require clarification before we de- rive our hypotheses. First, the unfolding model of turnover (Lee et al., 1996) describes how turnover decisions can be functions of “shocks” (i.e., jarring events for employees), with downsizing cited as one such shock (Holtom, Mitchell, Lee, & Inder- rieden, 2005). We focus on the shock implications of both downsizing as an event and the severity (i.e., magnitude) of the downsizing. The event as- pect is evident in Lee and Mitchell’s definition of a shock as a “very distinguishable event that jars employees toward deliberate judgments about their jobs and, perhaps, to voluntarily quit their job” (1994: 60). The severity emphasis evolves from our assumption that larger downsizings are more jar- ring, shocking, and threatening than are smaller downsizings; this logic is consistent with downsiz- ing’s operationalization as a percentage or propor- tion in prior downsizing research (e.g., Batt et al., 2002). Second, although downsizing is a multifac- eted process, our treatment focuses on layoffs. Be- cause such job loss is involuntary, layoffs represent downsizing at its most severe and are particularly consistent with the notion of downsizing as a “psy- chological contract” violation (Robinson & Rous- seau, 1994) and, thus, a jarring event, or shock, that may prompt surviving employees to consider leav- ing. Third, we primarily rely on individual-level theories to derive organization-level predictions. Recent work indicates that organization-level turn- over findings (e.g., Batt et al., 2002; McElroy et al., 2001; Shaw, Delery, Jenkins, & Gupta, 1998; Shaw et al., 2005) are consistent with expectations in- ferred from individual-level frameworks; similarly, researchers have used individual-level perspec- tives on organizational commitment both to specu- late about organization-level relationships involv- ing turnover (e.g., Batt et al., 2002; Huselid, 1995; Mishra & Spreitzer, 1998) and, via aggregation, to test such relationships (e.g., Simons & Roberson, 2003). Downsizing and Voluntary Turnover Rates Main effect. The unfolding model of turnover describes psychological and behavioral paths that employees take when quitting (Lee et al., 1996). In the model’s most commonly followed turnover path (path 3), a shock leads employees to reevalu- ate their current work circumstances, consider job alternatives, and then quit, usually to take another job offer or to pursue a likely offer. The results of substantial individual-level research addressing the effects of downsizing on survivor attitudes are consistent with this path and the presumption that downsizing is an unpleasant shock that prompts fear and resentment. Downsizing has been found to negatively affect organizational commitment (Brockner, Grover, Reed, Dewitt, & O’Malley, 1987; Knudsen, Johnson, Martin, & Roman, 2003), job satisfaction (Armstrong-Stassen, 2002; Luthans & Sommer, 1999), job involvement (Brockner, Grover, & Blonder, 1988), and trust (Armstrong-Stassen, 2002). Given that such attitudes, particularly organ- izational commitment and job satisfaction, consis- tently predict voluntary turnover (e.g., Tett & Meyer, 1993), even at the business-unit level (e.g., Simons & Roberson, 2003), a positive downsizing- turnover relationship seems likely. Indeed, in the only study to examine the relationship, Batt et al. (2002) showed a positive link between the percent- age of core employees displaced and quit rates in the telecommunications industry. It is possible, however, that despite the attitudi- nal fallout, downsizing survivors are not more likely to leave. Surviving job cuts, especially if the downsizing is attributed to strategic restructuring rather than simple cost cutting, could lead to greater appreciation of what one has, a perception of relative safety (i.e., having “dodged a bullet”), expectations of more varied work, and belief that the company is positioned to excel. Overall, how- ever, we believe it unlikely that such retention- enhancing impressions will fully counteract the negative attitudinal effects described above. Hence, we first attempted to replicate the Batt et al. (2002) finding in a broad sample of occupations, firms, and industries. Hypothesis 1. Downsizing is positively related to voluntary turnover rates. Mediated relationship. Because attitudinal ef- fects on voluntary turnover are central to so many 2008 Trevor and Nyberg 261 turnover models (e.g., Gerhart, 1990; Hom, Carani- kas-Walker, & Prussia, 1992; March & Simon, 1958; Mobley, 1977; Trevor, 2001), support for Hypothe- sis 1 will be enhanced if a relevant (aggregated) employee attitude emerges as a mediator. Mishra and Spreitzer’s (1998) conceptual model positions organizational commitment as such a mediator, and Batt et al. (2002) speculated that their down- sizing– quit rate finding stemmed from employees’ perceiving a threat to employment security and subsequently having reduced organizational com- mitment. Further, empirical work identifies organ- izational commitment as both a downsizing conse- quence (e.g., Brockner et al., 1987; Knudsen et al., 2003) and a voluntary turnover antecedent (Tett & Meyer, 1993 [meta-analysis]). Hypothesis 2. Organizational commitment me- diates the positive relationship between down- sizing and voluntary turnover rates. the organizational level turnover prediction at should be highly context-dependent. Our proposed interactions are consistent with a general contin- gency framework that stems from the unfolding model of turnover: a shock such as downsizing will often result in employee scrutiny of a current job situation, which is then followed by job search, evaluation of alternative offers, and, depending on the evaluation results, quitting or staying (Holtom et al., 2005; Mitchell, Holtom, & Lee, 2001). Thus, a downsizing shock that jars an employee onto this most common of turnover pathways leads to a quit or stay decision based on an analysis of the utility of (i.e., the value of and satisfaction with) one’s current employment relative to the expected utility of alternative employment. We argue that HR prac- tice dimensions moderate downsizing effects by affecting these postdownsizing utility levels. Fig- ure 1 depicts these relationships. General Unfolding Model Contingency HR Practices That Buffer Downsizing Effects Paralleling individual-level turnover research (e.g., Gerhart, 1990; Schwab, 1991; Trevor, 2001), Certain sets of HR practices should become more salient as a downsizing shock leads to closer scru- HR Practices as Moderators of the Relationship between Downsizing and Voluntary Turnover Ratesa FIGURE 1 a Both examples of moderation are consistent with the general contention of the unfolding model of turnover, that shocks lead to greater scrutiny of the employment context. This scrutiny involves a comparison of the utilities of current and alternative employment. We argue that HR practices largely determine the results of this comparison, and thus the extent to which downsizing affects voluntary turnover rates. 262 Academy of Management Journal April tiny of an employment situation. Two of these HR practice dimensions may buffer (i.e., limit) the negative impact of downsizing on current em- ployment utility and subsequent turnover. Ex- actly how this buffering effect occurs, however, depends on whether the HR practice dimension promotes perceptions of procedural justice or per- ceptions of job embeddedness. Procedural justice. Procedural justice is the fair- ness of procedures used in decisions that affect employees (Folger & Greenberg, 1985). The poten- tial for HR practices associated with perceived pro- cedural justice to buffer downsizing effects stems from the fact that employment outcomes (e.g., pay) received over the long term are— given their large impact on material gains—seen as more important than a single short-term outcome. Procedural jus- tice perceptions fuel optimism regarding these crit- ical long-term outcomes, since fair processes sug- gest, even in light of short-term disappointment, that favorable outcomes lay ahead. This conviction leads people to assign less weight to, and be less affected by, short-term outcomes; indeed, a variety of empirical work indicates that a single employ- ment outcome has a smaller effect in the presence of procedurally just conditions associated with the outcome’s allocation (Brockner & Wiesenfeld, 1996). This contingency suggests that, given HR practices that promote procedural justice percep- tions (e.g., a grievance or appeals process, a confi- dential problem-solving avenue, an ombudsperson designated for complaint resolution), the unfavor- able short-term downsizing outcome will yield a smaller decrement in current employment utility; hence, high levels of such practices should reduce the effect of the downsizing shock on voluntary turnover.1 Hypothesis 3. Downsizing’s positive relation- ship with voluntary turnover rates diminish at high levels of HR practices likely to promote procedural justice perceptions. 1 Our position implies that procedural justice percep- tions other than those solely associated with a downsiz- ing event itself will reduce downsizing impact. As de- scribed above, procedural justice in one domain can reduce the effects of distributive outcomes because it can lead people to infer that they will be treated justly, and thus likely will fare well, in the future (Brockner & Wiesenfeld, 1996). Given this stipulation of procedural justice generalizing from one domain to another, HR practices likely to yield procedural justice perceptions not specific to downsizing should also be likely to miti- gate downsizing effects by yielding optimism regarding future treatment. Job embeddedness. The second HR practice di- mension of interest from the perspective of buffer- ing downsizing spillover is job embeddedness, which is the level to which employees’ are bound in a social web (both on and off the job) that keeps them attached to their organization (Lee et al., 2004; Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, Sablynski, & Erez, 2001). To examine whether employment outcomes that tie employees’ lives to their current employer reduce downsizing effects on turnover, we created a job embeddedness index from five practices that researchers (Mitchell, Holtom, & Lee, 2001; Mitch- ell, Holtom, Lee, Sablynski, & Erez, 2001) have specifically identified as contributing to job embed- dedness perceptions (i.e., defined benefits plans, sabbaticals, on-site childcare, hiring for organiza- tional fit, and flextime). Although Mitchell, Holtom, and Lee stated that job embeddedness “seems to buffer the individual from the effects of shocks that might otherwise prompt one to leave” (2001: 104), empirical re- search has yet to explicitly test whether shock ef- fects depend on either job embeddedness or the practices that lead to it. A specific rationale for expecting this interdependence is evident in a dis- cussion of multiple employment outcomes that Brockner and Wiesenfeld (1996) provided as an extension of their procedural justice moderation logic that we described above. Those authors ar- gued that, because people prefer positive outcomes, an unfavorable outcome in an exchange relation- ship may lead to greater attention to other relevant outcomes in the relationship. This premise, re- cently supported in a multiple pay outcome con- text (Trevor & Wazeter, 2006), thus suggests that the unfavorable downsizing outcome should lead to greater scrutiny of other relevant employment out- comes, such as those associated with the HR prac- tices that yield job embeddedness perceptions (e.g., a defined benefit plan, on-site childcare, and fit with the organization). This greater attention should, at high levels of these embeddedness-rele- vant HR practices, make heightened job embedded- ness perceptions very salient; the heightened sense of attachment, in turn, would constrain downsiz- ing-driven reduction in current employment utility and reduce downsizing effects on turnover rates. In contrast, the unfavorable downsizing effect on em- ployees should be greater at lower levels of embed- dedness-relevant practices, where less favorable outcomes mean that there is little sense of embed- dedness and attachment to constrain downsizing- driven reduction in the utility of the current em- ployment (i.e., little buffering of the downsizing shock). 2008 Trevor and Nyberg 263 Hypothesis 4. Downsizing’s positive relation- ship with voluntary turnover rates diminishes at high levels of HR practices likely to embed employees in their organization. HR Practices That Enhance Alternative Employment Utility Whereas our focus in the previous two hypothe- ses was on HR practice dimensions that buffer downsizing-driven reduction in the utility of cur- rent employment, here we address practices that, following a downsizing, should enhance the utility of alternative employment. Because alternative em- ployment options are functions of both job search (e.g., Schwab, Rynes, & Aldag, 1987) and individ- ual attributes that signal employee quality to the market (e.g., Spence, 1973), we focus on HR prac- tices that positively affect search and signaling ca- pabilities. Career development practices, in partic- ular, should foster these capacities. At higher levels of career development practices that enhance search (e.g., a career resource center, formal employee assessment to identify develop- ment opportunities) and/or signaling (e.g., formal succession planning, a transfer policy to support learning), employees should enjoy the ease of movement in the job market that alternative em- ployment options bring. In previous research using employee quality signals (Trevor, 2001) and mar- ket-level job availability (Carsten & Spector, 1987; Gerhart, 1990; Trevor, 2001) as indications of high levels of such ease of movement, job dissatisfaction has been more likely to lead to voluntary turnover. Thus, it also seems likely that downsizing-driven attitudinal fallout and scrutiny of the employment situation will be more likely to lead to quitting at higher levels of career development practices that enhance search, signaling, and subsequent alterna- tive employment options (i.e., when ease of move- ment is high). In other words, shocked employees will be more likely to leave when HR practices enhance alternative employment utility by helping to provide better external job opportunities (see Figure 1). We recognize, however, that career development practices also prepare employees for internal op- portunities. As a downsizing shock drives employ- ees to evaluate their current employment situation, the perception of internal movement potential could enhance the utility of the current employ- ment. On balance, however, we expect that career development practices should do more, in the post- downsizing environment of decaying commitment and satisfaction, to enhance the utility of alterna- tive employment (via improved search and signal- ing) than to improve current employment utility. Hypothesis 5. Downsizing’s positive relation- ship with voluntary turnover rates strengthens at high levels of HR practices likely to enhance career development. METHODS Sample Our sample consisted of employee-friendly com- panies that were invited to submit detailed infor- mation in applications to be included in the 1998 and 1999 Fortune magazine articles on “the 100 best companies to work for in America” (Branch, 1999; Levering & Moskowitz, 2000). Levering and Moskowitz (2000) chose the invitees from their own database of over 1,000 companies; criteria for being invited to compete for the “100 Best” list included minimum existence (ten years) and em- ployment (500 people) levels, as well as simply being considered by the authors to be a viable can- didate. Of the 1998 invitees, 206 companies agreed to complete the application process (Branch, 1999), in 1999, 236 did so (Levering & Moskowitz, 2000). Hence, we began with a sample of 442 company- years. Missing data limited the sample for our mul- tivariate turnover rate analyses to 106 companies in 1998 and 161 companies in 1999, for a total sample of 267 company-years. The organization-level data used here come from an extensive company-level questionnaire de- signed by Hewitt Associates, a management con- sulting firm. Each company applying to be on the Fortune “100 best” list was asked to complete this questionnaire on management practices. The sur- vey was typically filled out by a team of the com- pany’s managers and human resource profession- als. the mean reported person-hours devoted to the survey was 47.3, suggesting consid- erable effort on the part of the respondents. Survey items were in reference to United States– based full-time exempt (i.e., salaried) and nonexempt (i.e., hourly) employees. In 1998, Each company applying to be on the “100 best” list also was required to administer an employee attitude survey created by the Great Place to Work® Institute. Although the attitudinal items used in selecting companies for the list were proprietary and unavailable to us, we did have access to two other items collected from the applicant compa- nies’ employees. In 1998 and 1999, the applying companies were instructed to randomly survey 250 and 275 employees, respectively. Explicit direc- tions for randomly sampling employees and ad- 264 Academy of Management Journal April ministering the attitude survey were provided to each applicant. Companies distributed the ques- tionnaires with preaddressed and stamped enve- lopes. Employees were directed to return the ques- tionnaires directly to the data processor at the Great Place to Work® Institute, thus ensuring anonymity and confidentiality. Companies applying to be on the “100 best” list were also required to share the precise sampling mechanism followed in distribut- ing employee questionnaires. The authors of the Fortune articles on the “100 best” companies (Le- vering & Moskowitz, 2000) also checked for sam- pling irregularities by comparing survey respon- dent demographic characteristics with each company’s overall demographic characteristics, which were reported in the company-level survey. Response rates for companies averaged 53 percent in 1998 and 52 percent in 1999. Company and employee surveys were adminis- tered in the summers of 1998 and 1999. For addi- tional detail on the data acquisition, see Fulmer, Gerhart, and Scott (2003). Measures Voluntary turnover rate. Company survey re- spondents were asked to provide the number of full-time voluntary leavers during the most recent 12 months and their number of full-time employees from 12 months prior to the survey. We divided the former by the latter to create the voluntary turnover rate. We then took the natural logarithm of the result to transform the highly skewed dependent variable data to a more normal distribution. Downsizing rate. The company survey asked for the calendar year of the most recent reduction in force. We considered an organization to have downsized if its respondent reported a reduction in force in the survey’s calendar year or in the preced- ing two calendar years (e.g., a 1999 survey respon- dent with a reported downsizing in 1999, 1998, or 1997). Although there is no research on how long downsizing effects on survivors may persist, we used the two preceding years because a shock that eventually leads to quitting often necessitates a considerable period of evaluation and search before suitable alternative employment is found. On the more recent end of the time frames, we included current year (year t) downsizing in the measure for three reasons. First, news and rumors of downsiz- ing often precede the actual event, potentially prompting pre-event voluntary turnover. Consis- tent with this concern is Cascio’s (2002a) conten- tion that employees tend not to be surprised by layoffs and the finding of Swaen, Bultmann, Kant, and Van Amelsvoort (2004), in which psychologi- cal distress significantly increases both one month after a downsizing announcement and before the event itself. Second, including year t downsizing was necessary to ensure that we captured the im- mediate (within-year) effects on voluntary turn- over. This was a particular concern given that “turnover intentions” appear to peak, relative to predownsizing levels, when measured closer to the event itself (Allen, Freeman, Russell, Reizenstein, & Rentz, 2001). Third, simultaneity concerns asso- ciated with same-year downsizing and turnover measures are minimal, as companies presumably do not downsize in response to increased turnover. The company survey also asked what percentage of employees was downsized.2 The response, which we first converted to a proportion, allowed us to model the severity of the downsizing, under the assumption that shock is greater following larger downsizings. We then logged the highly (positively) skewed downsizing rates (after adding a constant of .0001 because the natural logarithm of zero is undefined; see Cohen, Cohen, West, and Aiken [2003]). Logging an independent variable en- ables examination of underlying nonlinearity in which effects are considerably larger at the lowest levels of the raw values of that variable (Cohen et al., 2003). This process allowed us to infer whether the transition from nondownsizer to downsizer (i.e., the event) carried shock effects in addition to those carried by downsizing severity (we explore this distinction further in the Results and Discus- sion sections). All company respondents reporting a downsiz- ing also reported implications for “terminated em- ployees in the most recent downsizing,” indicating that all reported downsizings involved termina- tions. Downsizings were reported in 102 cases (38 percent of the sample), with mean downsized pro- portions of .014 overall and .036 among the downsizers. HR practices as moderators. We used 12 mea- sures to create three theoretically driven additive indexes of HR practices. Working at the index, rather than practice, level was consistent not only with our theory, but also with considerable prior 2 Unfortunately, the item wording differed in the two years, as the 1998 survey asked, “What percentage of employees were dismissed due to the most recent down- sizing?” and the 1999 survey asked, “What percentage of employees left due to the most recent downsizing?” Analysis of companies that were present in both years, however, indicates that the two items were answered from similar perspectives, as the correlation between re- sponses to the 1998 item and the 1999 item (when refer- ring to the same downsizing event) was .90. 2008 Trevor and Nyberg 265 research. Batt (2002) and Delery (1998), for exam- ple, described theoretically driven additive indexes in which higher scores meant greater investment in a range of applicable practices, and similar results emerged as a function of practices substituting for one another in an index. An index of this type is composed of multiple elements whose values are not caused by an underlying construct but, when summed, yield a value whose magnitude is rele- vant to the construct (Batt & Valcour, 2003). Such indexes are the preferred method for creating a single measure from a series of underlying dimen- sions that can be cumulated to determine the level of a construct of interest (Shaw et al., 2005). Six of the 12 HR practices used to create the indexes were assessed separately for exempt and nonexempt employees. Because organizations man- age exempt and nonexempt employees differently (Gerhart & Trevor, 1996; Lepak & Snell, 1999), this separation allowed for greater precision in identify- ing the extent to which a practice covered the overall workforce. For example, since we knew the exempt/ nonexempt proportions for each organization, a com- pany with 70 percent nonexempt employees that of- fered a certain practice only for exempts would be coded .30 (rather than a less representative 1). Thus, our indexes reveal the presence and, to some extent, the coverage of HR practices (though not the intensity of employee use). We created a procedural justice index to repre- sent an organization’s commitment to providing employees with a formal process for addressing perceived injustices. Company survey respondents were asked about the presence of “an ombudsman who is designated to address any employee com- plaints,” “a confidential hotline or other confiden- tial problem/resolution/complaint center,” and “a grievance or appeal process available to nonunion employees.” Items were coded 1 for “yes” and the values were then summed. The three items evolve directly from the formal procedures section of Moorman’s (1991) procedural justice scale, which assesses the presence of procedures that “provide opportunities to appeal or challenge,” “have all sides affected by the decision represented,” and “hear the concerns of all those affected.” Moor- man’s formal procedures items originated in part from Leventhal’s (1980) procedural justice rule of correctability (i.e., correcting past wrongs via griev- ance or appeals), which is consistent with our items and is frequently the basis for procedural justice measures in management research (e.g., Tepper & Taylor, 2003; Thau, Aquino, & Wittek, 2007). Two of the three major dimensions of job embed- dedness are fit (i.e., compatibility with one’s com- pany and off-the-job environment) and sacrifice (i.e., the cost of what would be given up by leaving) (Mitchell, Holtom, & Lee, 2001). Thus, we created a job embeddedness index of five HR practices that should yield perceptions along these dimensions (we did not have reliable HR practice measures of links to coworkers, the third dimension of job em- beddedness). Although the HR practices have never been tested as predictors of job embeddedness per- ceptions, Mitchell and his colleagues (Mitchell, Holtom, & Lee, 2001; Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, Sa- blynski, & Erez, 2001) explicitly emphasized cer- tain practices as fostering job embeddedness. As substantial sacrifices associated with leaving a job, these authors cited defined benefits plans and sab- baticals (which become increasingly valuable and/or available with increasing employee longev- ity), and on-site childcare, which is related to crit- ical off-the-job concerns. Regarding practices that promote fit, hiring for organizational fit has been described as increasing employee compatibility with the culture and values of an organization (Mitchell, Holtom, & Lee, 2001), and flextime has been described as important to fit with off-the-job considerations (Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, Sablynski, & Erez, 2001). These practices also parallel items used to assess job embeddedness perceptions (e.g., “I fit with the company’s culture” and “The retire- ment benefits provided by this organization are excellent”) from Mitchell, Holtom, Lee, Sablynski, and Erez (2001). To assess the job embeddedness practices, the company survey inquired about the presence of a defined benefits plan, paid sabbati- cals, on-site childcare, and “flexible or nonstand- ard arrival and departure times,” and the impor- tance of organizational in hiring decisions. Respondents ranked the importance of fit on a 1–14 scale on which 1 equaled “the most important hir- ing criterion”; we reversed these fit scores by sub- tracting from 15. Because the paid sabbatical and hiring-for-fit items separately addressed the ex- empt and nonexempt populations, we weighted the responses by exempt and nonexempt proportions before combining. We then standardized and added the scores for the five practices to create the job embeddedness index. fit Similarly, we created a career development in- dex tapping four practices likely to improve ability to compete in the external job market via enhanced signaling or search capabilities. The presence of a career resource center demonstrates a company’s willingness to commit resources to employee de- velopment and should provide employees with tools and strategies for enhancing their careers. Companies were also asked about the presence of “assessment of skills, knowledge, and abilities to 266 Academy of Management Journal April identify employees’ development opportunities”; the existence of this practice should make employ- ees more aware of their marketable characteristics and possible career paths. Together, these two prac- tices (career resource center and employee assess- ment) appear likely to enhance search efficiency. The presence of formal succession planning often involves a variety of developmental activities, such as education, rotation through various jobs and lo- cations, and special (visible) assignments (Noe, Hollenbeck, Gerhart, & Wright, 2003). Such activi- ties are likely to leave employees with greater sig- naling capabilities. Although succession planning is often confined to the management and profes- sional levels, over 30 percent of our companies reported using it for nonexempt populations. Fi- nally, the presence of a formal policy enabling ei- ther voluntary or required transfers “to support learning (e.g., international assignments)” should broaden employee experience and improve signal- ing on the job market (we used an affirmative re- sponse to either the voluntary or required formal transfer items as a single indicator). All four prac- tices were asked about for both exempt and nonex- empt populations, enabling us to weight the re- sponses by their respective proportions before combining. We then standardized and added the four scores to create the index.3 Because the substitutable elements in theoreti- cally driven additive indexes are not equivalent measures of an underlying construct, it is inappro- priate to use an internal consistency reliability measure (e.g., coefficient alpha) to test the level of agreement among the elements (Batt & Valcour, 2003; Delery, 1998; Shaw et al., 2005). Test-retest correlations, however, yielded reasonable evidence for the stability of the three indexes. For the 67 companies in our analyses that provided surveys in both 1998 and 1999, we found year-to-year corre- lations of .78 for the procedural justice index, .73 for the job embeddedness index, and .75 for the career development index. Organizational commitment. The 1998 and 1999 employee attitude data from each company included two slightly modifed items from Mowday, Steers, and Porter’s (1979) Organizational Commit- ment Questionnaire: “It would take a lot to get me 3 Although the company surveys included an item on hours devoted to training, there was no indication as to the extent to which training was firm-specific (and likely enhanced current employment utility) or general (and likely enhanced alternative employment utility via sig- naling). Thus, we did not include the item, as its rele- vance to our theoretically driven index was unknown. to leave this organization” and “I am glad I chose this organization over others I was considering when I joined.” These two items were scored on a scale anchored by “almost always untrue” (1) and “almost always true” (5). Coefficient alpha for all employee responses to these two questions was .84. We created the individual-level commitment score by summing the two item scores and dividing by two. To determine whether aggregating these commit- ment scores to the organization level was appropri- ate, we followed the approach of recent studies using aggregated employee attitudes (e.g., Currall, Towler, Judge, & Kohn, 2005; Fulmer et al., 2003; Whitener, 2001), including organizational commit- ment (e.g., Simons & Roberson, 2003). We first cal- culated the intraclass correlations (Shrout & Fleiss, 1979) of our commitment variable to estimate the reliability of a single employee response, obtaining an ICC(1, 1) of .056 in 1998 and .064 in 1999. Because our focus was on the company average score as a reliable differentiator among firms, how- ever, the ICC(1, k) was more relevant (Fulmer et al., 2003; Glick, 1985). Bliese (1998) demonstrated that even low ICC(1, 1) levels may lead to reliable ag- gregate means with sufficiently large groups. With an average of 137 responses per company in 1998 (min. ⫽ 41; max. ⫽ 754) and 147 responses per company in 1999 (min. ⫽ 62; max. ⫽ 801), our ICC(1, k) was .89 in 1998 and .91 in 1999. These values indicate that the mean level of commitment was indeed a reliable differentiator of our companies, thus pro- viding a foundation for averaging individual com- mitment scores within companies to create organi- zation-level commitment. Additional control variables. By controlling for the use of early retirement in the downsizing pro- cess, we increased the probability that we were seeing layoff effects in our downsizing measure. We included a dummy variable coded 1 if a com- pany indicated that an early retirement package was made available in association with its down- sizing event. Substantial organizational change, in- dependent of downsizing, may alter the relation- ship between employer and employees and may be related to downsizing. We controlled for this po- tential bias by including restructuring (company respondents were asked, “Within the last 12 months, has your organization experienced any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or spin-offs that affected at least 5% of your employee popula- tion?”). Because labor costs often drive downsizing decisions (Cascio, 1993), and because pay is often related to turnover, we accounted for pay level, measured as the response on a four-point scale indicating whether the company targeted compen- 2008 Trevor and Nyberg 267 sation below market level, at market level, between the 51st and 74th percentiles, or between the 75th and 100th percentiles. Also, given possible associ- ations with downsizing and turnover, we con- trolled for organization age, proportion male (em- ployees), proportion exempt, proportion union, proportion aged 25 years or less, proportion with less than 2 years service, number of employees (logged), and the proportion of change in employ- ees from year t to year t – 1. Industry health may affect both downsizing likelihood and turnover rates. Thus, we also included dummy variables to account for the effects of the 48 industries in our data at the two-digit SIC code level. Finally, to more precisely account for industry-specific labor demand, we controlled for two-digit industry un- employment rate data obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/). Data Analysis Researchers modeling turnover rates have used both ordinary least squares (OLS) regression anal- ysis (e.g., Shaw et al., 1998) and Tobit regression analysis (e.g., Batt et al., 2002). Tobit models were originally derived because a concentration of obser- vations at some limiting lower or upper value vio- lates OLS assumptions. Absent such observations, however, OLS is appropriate (Tobin, 1958). Be- cause we had no turnover rates equal to zero, we present OLS analyses. Unreported Tobit models, with censoring stipulated for very low rates, yielded highly similar results. Additionally, be- cause 67 companies provided company-year obser- vations for both 1998 and 1999, we used robust variance estimators with the standard regression model. As an extension to variance estimators cre- ated to account for heteroskedasticity (e.g., White, 1980), these also provide standard error estimates that require only that observations be independent across, but not necessarily within, the source of the dependence (Rogers, 1993). RESULTS Main and Mediated Downsizing Effects Table 1 presents means, standard deviations, and correlations. The essentially zero correlation between downsizing rate and voluntary turnover rate is nei- ther surprising nor indicative of lack of support for our focal relationship. The covariation among the two variables and several of our controls illustrates the potential for a zero-order correlation to inflate or de- flate the more valid relationship estimate from a cor- rectly specified multivariate model. Table 2 reports the results of the multivariate tests. In support of Hypothesis 1, model 1 reveals that downsizing rate has a statistically significant effect on voluntary turnover rates.

Marginal effects translated back into the original met- rics of both variables yield more intuitive interpreta- tion: the predicted raw turnover rate increases 25 percent (from .104 to .130) when going from non- downsizing status to a downsizing rate of .005 (the 21st percentile of downsizing rate for companies that did downsize). In comparison, companies that down- size at rates of .02 (50th percentile of downsizers), .05 (75th percentile of downsizers), and .10 (93rd percen- tile of downsizers) are predicted to have raw turnover rate levels and increases (relative to nondownsizing status) of .141 and 36 percent, .149 and 43 percent, and .155 and 49 percent, respectively. Put another way, over half of the raw turnover rate increase pro- jected from reducing workforce by 10 percent occurs as a result of cutting the first one-half of 1 percent of employees. Figure 2 shows this relationship in the graph on the top left. As indicated in the figure, and in keeping with Cohen et al.’s (2003) discussion of log transforma- tions, our logging of downsizing rate allowed us to transform into linearity an underlying nonlinear relationship in which the effects on raw (or logged) voluntary turnover rates are considerably larger at low levels of raw downsizing rates. Because this nonlinearity is an important empirical and concep- 2008 Trevor and Nyberg 269 Main and Moderating Downsizing Rate Effectsa FIGURE 2 a Low and high x-axis levels of logged downsizing rates represent nondownsizers and the median downsizing rate among companies that did downsize, respectively. tual consideration that has yet to be explored in the downsizing literature, we conducted an additional analysis (available from the authors) to shed further light on why the effects appeared to be so much stronger at the point of transition from nondown- sizer to downsizer. We reran models 1 and 3 after replacing the logged downsizing rate with both a downsizing dummy and the raw downsizing rate, thus capturing downsizing events and their sever- ity in separate variables in the same model. Both variables had positive, statistically significant ef- fects, further suggesting that both a downsizing event and its severity uniquely contribute to turn- over via shock. We return to this issue in the Dis- cussion section. In Hypothesis 2, we predict that aggregated or- ganizational commitment will mediate the effect of downsizing on turnover. Model 2 illustrates the significant relationship between logged downsiz- ing rate and commitment. In model 3, in which organizational commitment is added to model 1 as a predictor, commitment is a statistically signifi- cant predictor of logged turnover rates, and the downsizing coefficient is reduced by 25 percent, thereby exhibiting partial mediation. More for- mally, Sobel’s (1982) test revealed statistical sup- port for mediation (p ⬍ .05). Downsizing by HR Practice Index Interactions Models 4 and 5 in Table 2 provide results sup- porting the downsizing by procedural justice index interaction predicted in Hypothesis 3 (the two models are differentiated by the presence of com- mitment). In model 4, for example, evaluating the downsizing effect at one standard deviation above and below the moderator mean indicates that the relationship between logged downsizing rates and logged voluntary turnover rates is about 3.5 times greater when the procedural justice index is low 270 Academy of Management Journal April than it is when the index high. The graph on the bottom left of Figure 2 illustrates this relationship. In terms of marginal effects, downsizing .02 of a workforce, which was the median rate for compa- nies that downsized, predicts a raw turnover rate increase of 63 percent when the procedural justice index is low, but an increase of only 15 percent when it is high.4 Models 4 and 5 also support Hypothesis 4. In model 4, the relationship between logged downsiz- ing rates and logged voluntary turnover rates is almost four times greater when the job embedded- ness index is low than when it is high, as the graph on the top right of Figure 2 shows. Marginal effects reveal that downsizing .02 of a workforce predicts a raw turnover rate increase of 65 percent when the job embeddedness index is low, but only an in- crease of 14 percent when it is high. Hypothesis 5 was also supported in both models. The relationship between logged downsizing rates and logged voluntary turnover rates in model 4 is almost four times greater when the career develop- ment index is high than when it is low; the bottom right graph in Figure 2 illustrates this relationship. Marginal effects reveal that downsizing .02 of a workforce predicts a raw turnover rate increase of 13 percent when the career development index is low, but an increase of 66 percent when it is high. thus leaving only years t ⫺ 1 and t ⫺ 2 downsizing to predict year t turnover. Support was weakened, indicating that excluding shared variation between same-year downsizing and turnover is problematic in that much of the turnover driven by downsizing likely occurs reasonably close to the event (see the downsizing measure description for our rationale for including year t downsizing). Third, we reex- amined the interaction of downsizing and the ca- reer development index after using only the trans- fer policy and succession planning items to comprise the index. The dropped items (career re- source center and employee assessment) were in- tended to reflect practices that would enhance em- ployee search capabilities, but we wanted to check that our career development index was not instead capturing downsizers’ attempts to help downsizing victims and other potential leavers find external employment. The streamlined measure replicated the original interaction finding, alleviating con- cerns that we were misinterpreting downsizer en- couragement of turnover as search-and-signal- driven turnover. Finally, although our focus was on the whole downsizing effect, regardless of whether the event was motivated by financial reasons, in- cluding controls for return on assets and total shareholder return did not materially change the results. Alternative Analyses DISCUSSION We conducted four additional variants of our primary analyses to check the robustness of our findings. First, although our robust standard errors approach only requires independence between, but not within, companies, we also conducted analyses to ensure that the 67 companies that were present in both 1998 and 1999 were not driving our results. Dropping one of the observations for each of these 67 companies (e.g., dropping the 1999 observation) yielded no meaningful changes, indicating that de- pendent observations were not a major concern. Second, we reran our analyses after reconfiguring the downsizing variable so as to exclude year t, 4 A counterintuitive aspect of this interaction merits mention. In the absence of downsizing, turnover rates were higher when the procedural justice index was high (see Figure 2, bottom left). A potential explanation is that the practices in this index deal with the correction of injustices (e.g., via grievance or appeals). As such, more of these practices may be present when there are more wrongs in need of righting. Such an environment may contribute to voluntary turnover, especially in the ab- sence of the focus on fair procedures that a downsizing shock should bring. In sum, we found a positive relationship between downsizing rates and voluntary turnover rates, me- diation of that relationship by aggregated levels of organizational commitment, and moderation of the downsizing effect by procedural justice, job embed- dedness, and career development indexes. We next address these findings in terms of modeling the downsizing construct, implications for theory and practice, limitations, and future research. Modeling the Downsizing Construct Although a larger downsizing event might be thought likely to generate proportionally greater shock than a small one, the unfolding model’s char- acterization of shock as a very distinguishable event (Lee & Mitchell, 1994) suggests that the downsizing event in and of itself may be shocking. That is, comparing the utilities of current and al- ternative employment may be partially initiated simply by the presence of downsizing, somewhat irrespective of its severity. Our use of logged down- sizing rate allowed us to model a linear relation- ship that, when converted back into raw original metrics, revealed a nonlinear relationship that sup- 2008 Trevor and Nyberg 271 ports this interpretation. Moreover, our supple- mentary analyses (available upon request) with a downsizing dummy and the raw downsizing rate provide further insight. Because the downsizing event and its severity each contribute unique vari- ance to voluntary turnover rates, shock appears to manifest from the mere transition from nondown- sizer to downsizer, as well as from workforce re- duction magnitude. The effect size, which indi- cates that the transition alone predicts a 19 percent increase in turnover rates, highlights the impor- tance of the transition to downsizer status. Thus, researchers should carefully consider potential nonlinear, event, and severity considerations when conducting downsizing studies. Similarly, unfold- ing model research would benefit from work that recognizes the potentially unique shocks of an event and its severity. Implications for Theory Our findings are consistent with traditional ap- proaches to turnover that emphasize the compari- son between current and alternative employment utility that employees make when deciding to quit or stay (e.g., March & Simon, 1958; Mobley, 1977). The results also support the general logic of the unfolding model of turnover (Lee et al., 1996), in which shocks such as downsizing are argued to prompt employees to engage in this comparison. As such, we provide evidence that downsizing, and perhaps shocks in general, addresses the same lack of explained turnover variance that motivated the unfolding model’s derivation (see Lee, Gerhart, Weller, & Trevor [in press] for a related perspective that focuses on unsolicited job offers as shocks precipitating turnover). We confirmed earlier speculation that downsiz- ing should precipitate voluntary turnover through reductions in commitment (e.g., Batt et al., 2002; Mishra & Spreitzer, 1998), yet the mediation issue remains complex. The partial (25%) mediation as- pect is consistent with the unfolding model princi- ple that shocks lead to turnover via attitudes under certain conditions but lead to turnover irrespective of attitudes under others. In addition to reflecting unfolding model paths that do not involve atti- tudes, the nonmediated downsizing association with voluntary turnover could indicate unmea- sured downsizer tendencies to actively encourage leaving behavior. Interestingly, we do not know exactly where in our Figure 1 model, relative to the interactions, the commitment mediation occurs. One possibility is that commitment mediates the moderated effects (i.e., the mediation occurs to the right of the points of moderation in the model). We would interpret this as HR practices moder- ating the relationship between downsizing and the commitment that ultimately predicts turnover. Replacing the turnover-dependent variable with commitment and rerunning the basic moderated analysis, however, reveals little evidence of this, as the interactions do not emerge. Moreover, commit- ment mediation could occur at more than one place in the model, suggesting that detecting its exact location(s) may require finer-grained individual- level data. The topic is a fruitful area for future study. Regardless of exactly where they fall relative to commitment, our interactions provide nuanced support for the unfolding model’s general logic. That is, certain sets of HR practices reduced down- sizing shocks’ effects on turnover, and others strengthened it. Presumably, job embeddedness and procedural justice practices mitigate the extent to which downsizing reduces current employment utility. Similarly, we assume that career develop- ment practices magnify the extent to which down- sizing enhances the utility of alternative employers (see Figure 1). These interactions support the or- ganization-level extensions of several individual- level models that we invoked to illuminate the underlying processes through which the modera- tion might occur (e.g., Brockner & Wiesenfeld, 1996; Carsten & Spector, 1987; Gerhart, 1990; Lee et al., 1996; Trevor, 2001; Trevor & Wazeter, 2006). Although we used some of these individual-level frameworks to provide distinct rationales for mod- eration by the procedural justice index and job embeddedness index, at a very broad level it is also reasonable to infer a single explanation. The buff- ering of downsizing’s turnover effects appears to occur at high levels of HR practices that are gener- ally considered to reflect well on current employ- ment, as these practices constrain downsizing- driven reductions in current employer utility (albeit in different ways). Research that character- izes HR on a single dimension could be viewed as suggesting, in light of this general explanation, that the greater the degree of, for example, high-involve- ment practices (e.g., Guthrie, 2001) in an HR sys- tem, the more protected turnover tendencies will be from downsizing shocks (see Zatzick and Iver- son [2006] for a somewhat opposing take on pre- dicting productivity). This unidimensional HR ap- proach, however, would not explain the observed moderation by the career development index, which suggests that downsizing triggers a greater role for the search and signaling benefits from ca- reer development practices than for any enhanced current employment utility that these practices bring. Despite this qualification, formal testing of 272 Academy of Management Journal April unidimensional HR factors in future downsizing and turnover research would be of value. Implications for Practice Although downsizing is sometimes an integral part of a broader restructuring strategy (Cascio, 2002a), its allure is its potential to quickly yield substantial savings in employment costs. This promise, however, can be compromised, at least in part, by the considerable costs associated with un- anticipated increases in voluntary turnover. These costs stem from the inefficiencies associated with understaffing and from the likely need for subse- quent hiring and training of replacements to return an organization’s workforce to its target level. In an effort to avoid the inefficiency and expense of post- downsizing turnover, company decision makers should be mindful of turnover implications when deciding how many people to cut. Our results sug- gest that companies can expect a postdownsizing turnover increase, with the size of this increase dependent on the levels of job embeddedness, pro- cedural justice, and career development HR prac- tices. Being cognizant of these relationships pro- vides a means for an improved projection of postdownsizing employment levels and, in turn, more accurate determination of how much of the work force needs to be downsized. An issue potentially more fundamental than how much to downsize is whether to downsize. It is wise to consider turnover implications when making this decision. For example, our marginal effects analysis predicts, for an average company, a 31 percent in- crease in postdownsizing voluntary turnover rates even if just .01 of the workforce is downsized; if an organization also has low levels of practices that pro- mote procedural justice and job embeddedness per- ceptions, the predicted increase in quitting becomes 112 percent. This daunting prediction illustrates how downsizing strategies in certain contexts may fail, given understaffing inefficiencies and replacement costs. Hence, our results not only suggest how HR practices may mitigate downsizing effects on turn- over, but also how HR practices may, via turnover implications, hinder downsizing success. If downsiz- ing is inevitable, adopting job embeddedness and procedural justice practices prior to the event could pay dividends via reducing downsizing’s effect on turnover. The appropriateness of implementing or terminating HR practices in a downsizing context, of course, should be considered in relation to the esti- mated costs. Limitations and Future Research Although our results largely confirmed our hy- potheses, several limitations to the study are im- portant to consider. Certainly, external validity is an important concern. On the one hand, our sample spans multiple industries, both publicly and pri- vately held companies, and companies of a wide variety of sizes. Yet the fact that our entire sample is made up of relatively admirable, employee- friendly companies (each seeking a place in Fortune’s 100 best companies to work for in Amer- ica) raises the question of whether our findings tell us anything about downsizing effects in less employee-friendly places. One might speculate that, relative to such companies, our main effects are an overestimate; that is, downsizing in our employee-friendly organizations might constitute a more severe breach of an employee’s perceived psychological contract (Ho, Weingart, & Rousseau, 2004), as job security expectations may be much higher than in an average company. Alternatively, the potential for our results to underestimate effects in a broader population appears to be just as plau- sible. In our sample of the “best” places to work, there may have been a layer of employee good will and trust that buffered the downsizing fallout. Hence, the downsizings could have been seen as somewhat justified or unavoidable, with employ- ees reacting less severely than they might have without the good will and trust. Similarly, the na- ture of the overall sample may have restricted the range of downsizing, HR practices, commitment, and turnover rates, which would in turn likely constrain the effect sizes (and generalizability) of our relationships. Clearly, research on downsizing effects on turnover in other company populations would be a welcome addition to our study. Second, although our data allowed us to make in- ferences about downsizing and turnover rates, know- ing exactly who was being downsized and who quit would add considerably to our findings. We were unable to examine, for example, the reasonable ex- pectation that survivors will react more strongly when they are more similar to downsizing victims. Relatedly, knowing the job performance levels of postdownsizing leavers would be instructive, as turn- over implications change dramatically according to leaver job performance (e.g., Sturman et al., 2003; Trevor et al., 1997). Indeed, to the extent that leavers are easily replaceable by better-performing and/or less expensive workers, turnover may be desirable (Dalton, Todor, & Krackhardt, 1982; Hollenbeck & Williams, 1986; Martin & Bartol, 1985), suggesting a more positive interpretation of our downsizing ef- fects. In contrast, any postdownsizing increase in 2008 Trevor and Nyberg 273 strong performers’ leaving would be particularly det- rimental to an organization. Given that high-potential and high-performing employees enjoy greater mobil- ity and are the most likely to quit in response to undesirable circumstances (Trevor, 2001; Trevor et al., 1997), such an increase is likely. Future research on exactly who leaves following a downsizing, and on how context affects the distributional characteris- tics of this group, would be of great interest to re- searchers and practitioners. Third, although companies were instructed to randomly select employees for the survey from which we obtained the organizational commitment measures, we have no actual proof that this was done. Hence, to the extent that company represen- tatives, influenced by the wish to be chosen for the “100 best” list, selectively chose employees to take the survey, our mediation results may reflect bias. The safeguards employed by the administrators of the list likely discouraged self-serving tactics, yet we cannot dismiss the possibility. Fourth, the tim- ing of the measures was not ideal. HR practices were reported in the summer of year t, but turnover rate was calculated from the summer of year t – 1 to the summer of year t. This raises simultaneity ques- tions. The complexity of moderated relationships may reduce these concerns, as the alternative inter- pretation of our findings would be that turnover rate effects on the HR practice indexes depended on downsizing in a manner that produced results that correspond to our conceptually grounded hy- potheses. Although this relationship seems un- likely, we cannot rule it out. Another factor that may partially alleviate simultaneity concerns is that, for the 67 companies in our analyses that provided surveys in both 1998 and 1999, the re- ported values for the HR practices remained rela- tively constant across years; year-to-year correla- tions averaged .75 for our three HR practice indexes. Fifth, common method bias is possible in that the same employee might have provided the data on number of voluntary leavers, total employ- ees, downsizing occurrence and timing, and HR practices. The relatively objective nature of these questions reduces this concern; so also does the fact that independently collected organizational commitment, aggregated to the company level, me- diated the downsizing–turnover rate relationship in a manner consistent with our rationale. Finally, although we controlled for several as- pects of downsizing context (e.g., restructuring, early retirement), alternative explanations remain possible. We were unable to account for whether companies were repeat downsizers, which may have shed additional light on our findings. We also could not control for voluntary buyouts, which could conceivably have been figured into both the reported downsizing rate and the number of volun- tary leavers. This concern, however, is diminished to the extent that voluntary buyouts covaried with our early retirement control. Additionally, because the total number of employees downsized tends to be considerably smaller than the number of volun- tary leavers, any double-counting of employees tak- ing voluntary buyouts likely would have little ef- fect on the turnover rate measure. These concerns notwithstanding, we believe that our study’s evidence of variation in downsizing, HR practices, turnover rates, and aggregated atti- tudes is noteworthy. Despite their flaws, the data provide an unprecedented opportunity to better understand the turnover ramifications of downsiz- ing and the HR context. Conclusion Evidence is amassing that turnover rates are neg- atively related to financial performance (e.g., Glebbeek & Bax, 2004; Kacmar et al., 2006; McElroy et al., 2001; Shaw et al., 2005). Thus, business strategies that affect turnover rates should be exam- ined very carefully. In our study, downsizing, which is designed to reduce costs, predicted greater turnover rates, which increase costs; moreover, cer- tain types of HR practices mitigated the downsiz- ing-turnover relationship, while other HR practices strengthened it. Hence, it appears that the HR context has considerable impact on whether and the extent to which the shock of downsizing ulti- mately, to organizational performance. translates rates, via turnover Perhaps too easily lost in our analysis is the plight of the downsizing victims. The downsizing- turnover relationship suggests a sad irony in that employees are laid off by companies that may sub- sequently find themselves understaffed. Moreover, to the extent that turnover hinders organizational performance, the performance of downsizing com- panies may well suffer further through the leaving behavior that the layoffs generate. The formidable costs to downsizing victims (and perhaps to the society that absorbs them) may be seen as unavoid- able in today’s business environment, but this po- sition is much more palatable when the costs do not appear to be in vain. Hence, though we ac- knowledge the frequent necessity of downsizing, we also emphasize that downsizing wisely is im- perative. Careful attention to HR practices and the downsizing-turnover relationship, given the impli- cations for costs, understaffing, and organizational performance, appears to be one avenue toward downsizing wisely. 274 Academy of Management Journal April REFERENCES Allen, T.
