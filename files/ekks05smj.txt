Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in the notion of capabilities as an important source of competitive advantage. This recognition has, in turn, placed emphasis on the question of where and how these capabilities emerge and how they inﬂuence ﬁrm performance. The present paper is an attempt to address this question. Using a large sample of detailed project-level data from a leading ﬁrm in the global software services industry, we attempt to empirically study the importance of capabilities. We ﬁnd that two broad classes of capabilities are signiﬁcant. The ﬁrst class, which we label client-speciﬁc capabilities, is a function of repeated interactions with clients over time and across different projects. This learning from repeated interactions with a given client reduces project execution costs and helps improve project contribution. The second class, termed project management capabilities, is acquired through deliberate and persistent investments in infrastructure and systems to improve the ﬁrm’s software development process. Our empirical results suggest that the marginal returns to acquiring different capabilities may be different and an understanding of such trade-offs can improve ﬁrm decisions to improve and/or acquire such capabilities. We discuss the key contributions of our paper and the implications for future research on capabilities. Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. INTRODUCTION In recent years strategy scholars have increasingly agreed that non-imitable and non-substitutable or- ganizational capabilities (and resources) are a key source of inter-ﬁrm performance differences (Barney, 1991; Dosi, Nelson, and Winter, 2000; Keywords: organizational capabilities; ﬁrm performance; software services *Correspondence to: Prashant Kale, University of Michigan Business School, 701 Tappan Street, Room D4209, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, U.S.A. E-mail: kale@umich.edu Nelson, 1991; Rumelt, 1984; Wernerfelt, 1984). This recognition has, in turn, placed emphasis on the question of where and how these capabili- ties emerge and how they inﬂuence ﬁrm perfor- mance. Although there are a number of theoretical arguments about the characteristics of resources or capabilities that yield competitive advantage (Barney, 1991) and what prevents their imitation (Dierickx and Cool, 1989; Peteraf, 1993), we have limited understanding of where capabilities come from or what kinds of investment in money, time, and managerial effort is required in building them.

Ethiraj et al. it becomes important if the development of capabilities Furthermore, requires deliberate and sustained investment of ﬁnancial and managerial resources, both of which have alternative uses, to understand the costs and beneﬁts of such invest- ments. In other words, different capabilities may entail different ﬁnancial and managerial costs and yield dissimilar performance beneﬁts. The system- atic understanding of such trade-offs promises to enrich the theory and practice of strategy. This paper makes a modest attempt to systematically address some of these questions. This paper investigates two interrelated research questions: one, where do capabilities come from, and two, how do capabilities affect ﬁrm perfor- mance? We combine in-depth interview data with detailed, large sample, project-level data spanning a 6-year period from one ﬁrm in the Indian soft- ware services industry to carefully address both questions. In contrast with prior research, the rich, disaggregated project-level data about resource inputs, project characteristics, capability metrics, and proﬁtability that we collected allow us to delve deeper into the capabilities–performance link. Several reasons make the Indian software indus- try an attractive context for the study of ﬁrm capabilities. First, there is a widely shared view that much of the Indian software industry’s explo- sive growth over the last decade is accounted for by factor cost differences between India and the developed country markets (Arora et al., 2001; Nasscom, 2001). The implication is that perfor- mance differences are driven not by ﬁrm capabil- ity differences, but by country-level comparative cost advantages. While factor cost differences def- initely exist, even a cursory examination of the data suggests that ﬁrm-level explanations cannot be discounted. The Indian software services indus- try accounted for $6.2 billion of export revenues in 2000–01 (Nasscom, 2001). A telling statistic is that 0.8 percent (25 ﬁrms) of the ﬁrms in the indus- try (nearly 3000 ﬁrms) accounted for 60 percent of export revenues. Therefore, a relatively small set of ﬁrms growing at a compounded average annual rate of about 45–65 percent over the last decade accounts for much of the activity in the Indian software services industry. Our premise is that a detailed examination of the economics of one or more of these 25 ﬁrms can afford useful insight into the micro-foundations of the capabilities that underlie such sustained and robust growth in a competitive industry. Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Building on research on ﬁrm capabilities in general and on our detailed ﬁeldwork and inter- views with the project managers of several ﬁrms in the software services industry, we argue that two sets of capabilities are important in the software services industry: client-speciﬁc capabilities and project management capabilities. Client-speciﬁc capabilities are a function of repeated interac- tion with a given client across multiple projects over time. They largely reﬂect tacit knowledge of the client’s business domain and operating rou- tines acquired through repeated interaction with the client. In contrast, project management capa- bilities are acquired through deliberate and per- sistent investments in infrastructure (systems and processes) and training to improve the ﬁrms’ soft- ware development processes. They reﬂect techni- cal capabilities in software design, development, and execution. The development of these capabil- ities rests not only on implicit learning-by-doing processes but also on deliberate, proactive invest- ments in building them. For example, drawing on industry experience, some scholars derived eco- nomic models to show that it makes economic sense for software vendors to initiate the ﬁrst project with a client at low prices even if it amounts to a modest loss on the project. The ﬁrst project serves as a platform for the development of client-speciﬁc and project management capa- bilities that help signiﬁcantly reduce costs in the long run and ultimately generate positive returns (Whang, 1995). In our empirical analyses, we esti- mate the marginal contribution, cross-sectionally and temporally, of the two capabilities to project proﬁtability. The study makes two principal contributions to the extant literature on capabilities. First, we argue, and empirically demonstrate, that ﬁrm capabili- ties are often context-speciﬁc and fruitful research in this area might emanate from enjoining an in-depth study of the capabilities speciﬁc to a context and careful empirical estimation of their signiﬁcance and value. The distinguishing feature of our work is that we conceptualize the notion of capabilities at a more micro-level within the ﬁrm, namely the project(s) which the ﬁrm exe- cutes for its clients, develop appropriate measures for these capabilities, and examine their evolution and impact on ﬁnancial performance. Second, we argue, and show, that not all capabilities provide the same marginal contribution to performance. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) Where Do Capabilities Come From and How Do They Matter? 27 This is signiﬁcant because it suggests that if dif- ferent capabilities have different costs and beneﬁts associated with their development or acquisition, managers should pay attention to understanding these trade-offs in making investments in capabil- ity development. More broadly, our study advo- cates a shift in the debate from whether or not capabilities matter to ‘what’ capabilities matter and ‘how.’ The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we brieﬂy outline the research lit- erature on capabilities and how capabilities drive performance differences. We then describe the Indian software industry context in some detail and develop our hypotheses. In the following section we describe the data, the measures, and empiri- cal estimation procedures. Finally, we present the results and discuss their implications for research on capabilities. THEORY What are capabilities and why are they important? The notion of capabilities can be traced back to Penrose (1959) and Andrews (1971), among oth- ers (see also Selznick, 1957). Penrose (1959: 25) suggested that resources consist of a bundle of potential services. While these resources or factor inputs are available to all ﬁrms, the ‘capability’ to deploy them productively is not uniformly dis- tributed. Analogously, Andrews (1971) argued that the ‘distinctive competence’ of an organization is more than what it can do; it is what it can do particularly well. Building upon this earlier work, recent literature on the resource-based view con- ceptualizes resources and capabilities along two lines. One set of authors (see, for example, Barney, 1991; Peteraf, 1993) tend to deﬁne resources rather broadly so as to ‘include all assets, capabilities, organizational processes, ﬁrm attributes, informa- tion, knowledge, etc.’ (Barney, 1991: 101). Other authors, however, have sought to clearly delin- eate between resources and capabilities (Amit and Schoemaker, 1993; Grant, 1991) by arguing that ‘resources consist . . . of know-how that can be traded, ﬁnancial or physical assets, human capital etc. . . . [whereas] capabilities . . . refer to a ﬁrm’s capacity to deploy resources’ (Amit and Schoe- maker, 1993: 35). In this paper, we adopt the latter conceptualization of ﬁrm capabilities in developing Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. our arguments about where they come from and how they matter. These deﬁnitional and conceptual differences notwithstanding, strategy researchers agree that both resources and capabilities are essentially assets with rent-generating potential. The resource- based view literature largely emphasizes two kinds of rents1 they can generate. The ﬁrst parallels the textbook notion of (Ricardian) rents from scarce resources. Ownership of a scarce resource (say land in Manhattan) enables the owner to enjoy superior rents relative to competitors who do not own the resource (they lease the land). The scarcity rents here are rooted in the inelastic supply curve for the resource. In addition, there is the implicit condition that, all else being equal, the cost of own- ership is less than the lease cost. This means that at the time the scarce resource was acquired its price was less than its (future) marginal product (Peteraf, 1993). A second type of rent is quasi-rents (Klein, Crawford, and Alchian, 1978). Quasi-rents ‘are the excess of an asset’s value over its salvage value or its value in its next best use’ (Peteraf, 1993: 184). Quasi-rents are often associated with capabilities. The primary reason for this is that they are con- sidered to be a product of specialized assets that are embedded within the organizational context (Rumelt, 1987) such that their optimal deployment is contingent on the presence of other complemen- tary assets (e.g., managers, culture, technology) or even learning how to deploy the bundle of assets efﬁciently. Additionally, there is a cost involved in transferring this asset along with the complemen- tary assets to another ﬁrm, thereby reducing its productive value (Langlois, 1992). This difference in value is the quasi-rent accruing to the owner of the asset. Usually, quasi-rents are a function of the uncertainty about the production function underly- ing the deployment of resources (Rumelt, 1984). In this paper, our notion of capabilities reﬂects assets that can generate quasi-rents. Where do capabilities come from? Traditionally, strategy research has devoted lit- tle attention to the issue of where capabilities 1 Note that Winter (1995) refers also to Schumpeterian rents— entrepreneurial rents or rents from innovation—and monopoly rents—rents from output restriction under inelastic demand. Since neither of these rents is associated with resources or capabilities we do not discuss them here. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) 28 S. K. Ethiraj et al. come from. Nelson and Winter (1982) made one of the early theoretical attempts to understand this question. They viewed the ﬁrm as bundles of path-dependent knowledge bases. Over time, ﬁrms’ knowledge, accumulated through ‘learning by doing,’ is embedded in bundles of ‘routines’ that are likened to the genetic material of the ﬁrm. Routines, a central concept in evolutionary the- ory, involve repetitive patterns of activity, require investment in routine-speciﬁc human and physical capital, and are easily recognized as belonging to a class (Winter, 1990). An important element of their theory is the description of the ﬁrm as a historical entity, with productive knowledge being a result of endogenous, learning-by-doing processes. Conse- quently, this perspective sees ﬁrms as entities that possess heterogeneous capabilities as a function of their routines and search processes. These capabil- ities are rooted in the organizational skills and rou- tines that serve as organizational memory to repeti- tively execute the sequence of productive activities without trouble. At their core, these organizational skills and routines embody knowledge and compe- tence in carrying out the productive activities that the ﬁrm is engaged in. Building on the basic idea that history matters and that capabilities are rooted in contextually embedded knowledge underlying the production function, others have emphasized the signiﬁcance of absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990) and asset stocks and ﬂows (Dier- ickx and Cool, 1989) in driving capabilities-based competition. Some researchers have also suggested that capa- bilities are not merely the result of tacit accu- mulation of experience embedded in routines and learning by doing. They are also the result of deliberate investments in organizational structure and systems to make constant improvements in those routines and practices (Zollo and Winter, 2002). Organizations strive to adapt their oper- ating processes through proactive actions dedi- cated to process improvements. These may include explicit efforts to continuously learn and capture the lessons from prior experience of self or oth- ers (Collis, 1996; Zollo and Winter, 2002) and incorporate those lessons to make improvements in prevalent practices, or create formal mechanisms to coordinate and institutionalize the improvement efforts (Kale et al., 2002). Although the notion of making deliberate investments to improve ﬁrm capabilities may be understood uniformly by most ﬁrms, there are idiosyncratic ﬁrm-level differences Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. in the timing of this effort, the nature and amount of the investment and effort they undertake, and the internal organizational mind-set that supports this process. These differences may get reﬂected in signiﬁcant heterogeneity across ﬁrms with respect to the capabilities that result from this effort. is important In sum, it appears that in operationalizing the notion of capabilities it to show that: (1) capabilities involve the deployment of resources and there are strong theoretical reasons that undergird how and why they generate rents; (2) capabilities tend to evolve over time to reﬂect the joint effects of passive learning-by-doing and deliberate ﬁrm-level investments in learning and making improvements; and (3) capabilities are hard to imitate or easily acquire in factor markets and this forms the basis for rent generation. How do capabilities matter? The question ‘How do capabilities matter?’ is one that derives from the question posed earlier, ‘Where do capabilities come from’? We argued above that capabilities reﬂect the evolutionary pro- cess of deliberate ﬁrm-speciﬁc investments and the largely tacit ‘learning-by-doing’ that ﬁrms engage in. This in turn results in heterogeneity of ﬁrms and the consequent differences in their performance. If we assume for the moment that ‘learning-by- doing’ is distributed uniformly2 among ﬁrms, then most of the ex post ﬁrm performance heterogeneity is in fact a function of differences in the delib- erate, ﬁrm-speciﬁc investments made (see Helfat, 1994, for an excellent account of how differential R&D investments by a sample of petroleum ﬁrms led to ﬁrm heterogeneity). Differences in the ex post productive value of ﬁrm-speciﬁc investments suggest that ﬁrms face signiﬁcant ex ante trade- offs in their choices of ﬁrm-speciﬁc investments made to acquire certain capabilities. In the main, we expect that the trade-offs themselves are likely to vary between ﬁrms as well as within ﬁrms over time. Each ﬁrm needs to make a set of strategic choices that ﬁt together as a system (Porter, 1991). In making these choices, ﬁrms face signiﬁcant trade-offs, and the nature of the trade-offs can vary 2 The assumption of uniformity in learning-by-doing is unrealis- tic simply because it is likely to be endogenous with the choices of ﬁrm-speciﬁc investments. In effect, this assumption is plau- sible only if we can separate out learning-by-doing from the choices about ﬁrm-speciﬁc investments. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) Where Do Capabilities Come From and How Do They Matter? 29 over time as well. The trade-offs are primarily a function of the interdependencies between the var- ious strategic choices of the ﬁrm (Levinthal, 1997). When the choice to invest in acquiring a capabil- ity shares positive interactions with other choices within the ﬁrm, the marginal beneﬁt of acquiring the capability is likely to be higher than in the case when the choice shares negative interactions with other choices made by the ﬁrm. Simply put, different capabilities are likely to yield different marginal beneﬁts to the ﬁrms making the invest- ments in such capabilities. If indeed money and managerial time and effort are scarce and ﬁrms need to allocate these scarce resources among com- peting initiatives to acquire relevant capabilities, then it is of signiﬁcant theoretical and practical importance to understand the trade-offs they face in doing so. Theoretically speaking, the answer to this puzzle is rather obvious—managers should invest in acquiring capabilities that yield the great- est marginal returns to the investment. In prac- tice, however, such a cost–beneﬁt calculus is far from simple. We face formidable theoretical and empirical challenges because the interdependen- cies between the various strategic choices that a ﬁrm makes are often unknown and the impact on the ﬁrm of altering one choice can be unpredictable (Ethiraj and Levinthal, 2004). Moreover, as a ﬁrm attains critical its marginal returns to investing in the same capability might decline. Alternatively, the marginal returns to building other complementary capabilities might increase. In this paper, we make a modest attempt to examine the marginal returns to different capa- bilities, both cross-sectionally and temporally. levels on a given capability, Empirical research on capabilities The empirical literature on capabilities is fast growing and we can partition this body of work along two broad lines. The ﬁrst stream of work includes detailed historical accounts that track alternative choices made by ﬁrms and their perfor- mance outcomes. Several excellent papers in this tradition provide useful insight into the historical development and evolution of capabilities (e.g., Iansiti and Khanna, 1995; Rosenbloom, 2000). Unfortunately, such methods do not permit the estimation of the signiﬁcance and value of capabil- ities. The second stream of research that includes large-sample empirical work has attempted to do Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. this. Even in this tradition, however, few stud- ies have managed to adequately capture the spirit of the idea. They usually fall short either in the choice of the independent variables employed to measure capabilities or the dependent variable used to measure performance. Many studies have mea- sured capabilities using aggregate indicators such as R&D intensity (e.g., Silverman, 1999) at the ﬁrm level. But if capabilities critically reside at the operational level within ﬁrms, aggregate ﬁrm-level measures may tend to mask much of the variance within ﬁrms. Some recent studies have identiﬁed and mea- sured more disaggregated capabilities to address this limitation. For instance, Henderson and Cock- burn (1994), using survey data attempted to get at more disaggregated measures of R&D capabil- ity at the program level. They measured archi- tectural competence (ability to integrate knowl- edge within the ﬁrm) and component competence (locally embedded knowledge) at the R&D pro- gram level to predict patenting productivity. Sim- ilarly, McGrath, MacMillan, and Venkataraman (1995) measured ﬁrm competence at pursuing new initiatives and identiﬁed that deftness and com- prehensiveness are important precursors to compe- tence acquisition and ultimately to the emergence of competitive advantage. These studies and others in this tradition (e.g., Schroeder, Bates, and Junt- tila, 2002), however, have been limited to assess- ing ﬁrm performance with disaggregated, non- ﬁnancial measures of performance such as patent- ing or survey-based self-reports of performance. This is not surprising given that it is extremely difﬁcult to relate disaggregated measures of capa- bilities to aggregate, ﬁnancial measures of ﬁrm performance. Makadok and Walker (2000), in a notable exception, examine the ﬁnancial returns to forecasting ability in the money fund industry. Along similar lines, Brush and Artz (1999) explore the trade-offs in various services offered by differ- ent ﬁrms and their impact on revenue per transac- tion in the veterinary medicine industry. Our study adopts an approach that is similar to this latter set of studies. We construct disaggre- gated, context-speciﬁc capability measures that are as close to the operational level as is practically possible and we construct disaggregated ﬁnancial measures of performance at the same operational level. We also track the evolution of these capa- bility measures over time. Most importantly, our study is distinctive from these prior studies in that Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) 30 S. K. Ethiraj et al. we examine the choices made by a single ﬁrm over time and evaluate the performance trade-offs or the marginal returns to different capabilities that it sought to build over a 6-year period. The follow- ing section develops the key hypotheses advanced in this study. OVERVIEW OF THE INDIAN SOFTWARE SERVICES INDUSTRY In this section we provide a brief overview of the Indian software services industry. We focus on the demand- and supply-side economics of the industry and attempt to draw out the nature and type of capabilities that might have the potential to generate rents. that The Indian software services industry is rela- tively young, with many of its most mature com- panies incorporated in the late-1970s and early 1980s. The domestic market for IT services was always small and continues, even today, to account for only about 25–30 percent of the industry’s sales (Nasscom, 2001). The Indian industry re- ceived a big boost in the early 1990s when the demand for IT services in the developed world outstripped the available supply of skilled labor. India, which at time was graduat- ing 150,000 English-speaking engineers a year with only a limited demand for their services within the country, was well placed to take advan- tage of this opportunity. Companies in the devel- oped world began focusing on India to lever- age its low-cost, English-speaking IT manpower. The low levels of initial investment required to enter the software services business and the min- imal regulatory intervention from the Indian gov- ernment, created few, if any, entry barriers or constraints in these early years. Several hun- dred Indian ﬁrms were founded to exploit this opportunity and the industry witnessed very rapid growth. Overall, there was a general consensus that macro factors such as the access to large, low-cost, English-speaking technical manpower in India and improvements in IT-related infrastruc- ture (e.g., high-bandwidth communication lines) set up by private and state-owned enterprises pos- itively inﬂuenced the competitive advantage and growth of Indian companies (Arora et al., 2001; Nasscom, 2001). Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Demand for Indian software services Faced with a small and undeveloped domestic software services market, Indian software ﬁrms focused primarily on the export market. Their early work, however, was neither technologically very sophisticated nor critical to clients’ businesses. Clients usually did the high-end work such as requirement analysis and top-level design either in-house or through U.S.-based consultants. They outsourced the low-end, labor-intensive work such as low-level design, coding, testing, support and maintenance to Indian companies to leverage their low-cost activity base. Clients retained the high- end work in the early years either because their Indian vendors did not possess the requisite skills to undertake these activities or, even if they did, clients did not have sufﬁcient conﬁdence to entrust such activities to them. Thus, the origin of the Indian software industry was ﬁrmly rooted in performing low-end, technically less demanding and labor-intensive work for the global IT indus- try and exploiting labor cost arbitrage opportuni- ties between India and developed country markets (Nasscom, 2001). Over time, however, there was a change in this trend. The low entry barriers in the Indian software services industry triggered abnormally high levels of entry by new ﬁrms. Between 1989 and 1998, over 3000 software services ﬁrms were founded that aspired to serve export markets. Consequently, domestic competition in the labor market (i.e., for trained engineers) shot up. It was not enough any more to just possess low-cost labor resources and exploit arbitrage opportunities. Firms also needed to improve the productivity of labor to compete effectively in the market. Thus, some ﬁrms began a systematic push to build high-end software capa- bilities, move up the value chain, and improve rev- enue per employee ﬁgures. Consequently, the lead- ing Indian ﬁrms today are also the leading ﬁrms in the global market (see Market-Guide, 2002). Since the mid-1990s there has been a distinct shift in the nature of software projects executed by the leading Indian software ﬁrms. They gradually shifted their role from that of merely implement- ing a design provided by their overseas clients to becoming active participants in the design of the complete application product. As a consequence, they now span the full spectrum of jobs from highly labor-intensive code migration work such as the integration of old mainframe-based systems Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) Where Do Capabilities Come From and How Do They Matter? 31 into new e-commerce platforms, or developing new code for pre-designed applications and soft- ware tools, to projects that involve both conceptual design and implementation of customer relation- ship applications and supply-chain management systems. The capacity to execute such a range of jobs enabled these ﬁrms to deliver end-to-end solu- tions and, thereby, lay claim to a larger share of the client’s IT budget and compete for it with lead- ing ﬁrms in the United States such as IBM and Accenture. Overall, while comparative cost advantages do exist for Indian software ﬁrms, they are by no means sufﬁcient or even sustainable. First, the nature of services provided by these ﬁrms involves specialized work (e.g., designing supply chain management systems or setting up trading ex- changes) that requires not only technical knowl- edge of software design but also an in-depth under- standing of the client’s industry and business pro- cess. Second, even ﬁrms such as IBM, Sapient, and Accenture have set up subsidiaries in India exploit- ing the same cost advantages. These subsidiaries undertake software projects involving both design and development on latest-technology platforms and business applications. This development not only supports the argument that Indian software teams are capable of executing these high-value projects but also erodes much of the Indian ﬁrms’ traditional cost advantages. Supply of Indian software services3 Two aspects of the Indian software services indus- try are critical to understanding its supply-side economics: (a) where and how the software devel- opment process is managed and organized; and (b) what type of contracts are used to provide the services. We elaborate below. Indian software ﬁrms have traditionally executed two types of projects: onsite and offshore. In onsite projects the Indian ﬁrm supplies software profes- sionals who possess the requisite technical skills that the clients demand. The entire project is then developed and executed at the clients’ site. In off- shore projects, in contrast, the Indian ﬁrm typically sends a few software professionals to the client 3 The material here draws heavily from an excellent article on the Indian software industry by Arora et al. (2001). Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. site to understand its requirements and speciﬁca- tions, but thereafter the entire software is devel- oped in India. The post-development support and maintenance of the software is also carried out largely from India. In some cases, a hybrid of the two types is also observed. Obviously, the offshore development model is more cost effective due to labor market arbitrage. From a cost standpoint, the greater the proportion of work completed offshore, the lower the cost of project execution (Gopal et al., 2003). This is primarily because in onsite projects employees need to be paid in accordance with host country norms,4 which erodes a signiﬁ- cant proportion of the cost-based advantages that Indian ﬁrms enjoy. In the early days of the Indian software indus- try, Indian companies executed a majority of the projects onsite. This happened because, ﬁrst, the overseas clients had limited conﬁdence in the Indian ﬁrms’ ability to execute projects in confor- mance to their needs. Second, the Indian ﬁrms also had only a limited understanding of clients’ needs and often required close and regular interaction with the client. But, over time, as overseas clients developed conﬁdence in the software capabilities of their Indian vendors and the vendors, in turn, developed a better understanding of clients’ needs, it was possible to relocate the bulk of the project development activities to India to take full advan- tage of its low-cost development base. Improve- ments in the infrastructure for long-distance com- munication and data transfer facilitated this process as well. The second signiﬁcant feature of software ser- vices, both in India and worldwide, involves the type of contract adopted in software outsourcing arrangements. Contracts can be broadly classiﬁed into two categories: ﬁxed price and time & mate- rial (Banerjee and Duﬂo, 2000). In ﬁxed price contracts the vendor charges a ﬁxed fee for its services, which is usually negotiated before the start of the project. Although the vendor bears most of the risk in this case, efﬁcient project man- agement can yield potentially higher margins. In a 4 In the United States, issue of H1B visas to overseas software professionals requires the sponsoring ﬁrm to certify that the pro- fessionals are being paid wages commensurate with what a U.S.- based employee with similar qualiﬁcations would obtain. This provision was introduced to discourage ﬁrms from substituting domestic labor with low-cost foreign labor, while allowing them to access specialized labor not easily available domestically. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) 32 S. K. Ethiraj et al. time & material (T&M) contract, the vendor pro- vides services at a pre-negotiated rate for every person-hour of effort expended on the project and receives payment either at the end of the project or at periodic intervals when project milestones are reached. Here, although a vendor is usually pro- tected against any cost and schedule overruns that may arise due to changes in client speciﬁcations, there is a concomitant reduction in incentives for the vendor to execute more efﬁciently. In the early years, most Indian software ﬁrms preferred T&M contracts. Since these contracts were behavioral, the client needed a safeguard that the Indian ﬁrm was not billing them more person- hours than was necessary to execute the project. So clients typically reduced their risk by negotiating hard on the price per person-hour. From the Indian vendor’s standpoint, reduced risk came at the cost of reduced margins. Therefore, for ﬁrms that had the capability to manage their projects efﬁciently and assume the risks, it made economic sense to move to a ﬁxed-price contract that potentially yielded higher margins. In ﬁxed-price contracts, clients often agreed to higher prices because such contracts reduced the need for behavioral monitor- ing and had strong penalties associated with delays or defects in project completion. Thus a combina- tion of improved project execution and manage- ment capabilities and the Indian ﬁrms’ impetus to improve proﬁt margins led to an increasing pref- erence for ﬁxed-price contracts. Overall, on the supply side the steady transition from onsite to offshore projects and from T&M to ﬁxed-price contracts meant that an increasing share of project management risk had to be borne by the Indian ﬁrms. This meant that the ﬁrms had to acquire the requisite capabilities to compete effectively. The following section elaborates what these capabilities were and how they played a critical role in Indian ﬁrms’ successful evolution. Capabilities of Indian software services ﬁrms Against the backdrop of the demand- and supply- side economics of the Indian software services industry, two broad sets of capabilities are critical. The ﬁrst is what we term client-speciﬁc capabil- ities. As software ﬁrms work with their clients over time they develop several client-speciﬁc pat- terns of interaction that become cost-effective over repeated interactions. For instance, one of the ﬁrms we interviewed mentioned that clients tend to have Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. fairly idiosyncratic ways of doing things and it takes some time to understand and appreciate this. One of this ﬁrm’s clients wanted a team of its employees to be stationed at the client site for 3 months after completion of the project. Initially the Indian ﬁrm resisted such a demand since it led to increased costs. However, over a period of time, the ﬁrm was able to convince the client that it could provide the same quality of after-sales ser- vice with the support team based in India. This was possible because with repeated interaction with the same client over time software vendors not only develop a better understanding of the information infrastructure at the client site but also develop better clarity of how the software relates to the client’s business environment. Such knowledge is acquired through repeated interactions with the client over various stages of the development cycle such as requirements speciﬁcation, business pro- cess design, data preparation, software installation, debugging, and testing. Hence long-term relation- ships and repeated interactions with clients resulted in client-speciﬁc learning that had a positive effect on both revenues and costs. On the revenue side, clients were more will- ing to agree to higher prices on repeat projects as they developed conﬁdence in the capability of the Indian ﬁrm to execute projects per their speci- ﬁcations. We reckon that Indian ﬁrms were able to capture at least some of the switching costs faced by the client in ﬁnding a new vendor and build- ing a new working relationship. On the cost side, there was tangible cost reduction associated with working with a client over time. For instance, one of our interviewees pointed to a client who never speciﬁed requirements very clearly at the outset and tended to repeatedly come back and ask for new features after the project was delivered. While this tended to be disruptive initially and created problems for the Indian ﬁrm, over time it learned to work around this. Rather than deliver very ﬁn- ished projects, the vendor ﬁrm began to involve the client ﬁrm at the prototype stage itself and then started building in the client ﬁrm’s needs as the project went along. In this manner, they were able to avoid the post-delivery negotiations and completion delays and the associated costs. Such client-speciﬁc tailoring of projects also enhances the software ﬁrm’s understanding of the client’s business domain. Thus, repeat projects for clients helped develop important client-speciﬁc capabili- ties that contributed to higher proﬁts by reducing Strat. Mgmt.

Therefore, we hypothesize: Hypothesis 1: Development of client-speciﬁc capabilities based on repeated interaction with clients is positively related to project perfor- mance. and project management A second capability that is more fungible across clients and industry domains is the software devel- opment capability (Humphrey, 1989; Jalote, 1997). The following three capabilities are particularly important. (i) Software design and building capabilities: First, vendors must have the capability to understand the requirements of the client and design an appropri- ate system or architecture to address them. Second, they must possess the capability to efﬁciently and effectively build the code in conformance to the design and coordinate the entire code development process that is usually distributed across many teams and/or sites. These capabilities are usually reﬂected in the defects identiﬁed in the prod- uct/software during the design and development process. (ii) Effort estimation and management capabilities: Vendors have to be skilled not only in accurately assessing the requirements of the client but also in assessing the resource inputs or effort required to build and execute the project. They need to be able to identify appropriate resources (for instance, people with the necessary skill, expe- rience, availability, etc.) and create and use prior experience/data to arrive at accurate estimates of the resource/effort requirements. Further, they also require skills to ensure the effective management and deployment of the required resources. Poor capabilities in effort estimation and management are usually reﬂected in increased manpower cost and/or effort overrun. (iii) Schedule estimation and management capabilities: Once companies have a tentative idea of the resource inputs necessary to build and implement the project, they must be able to correctly estimate the duration and sched- ule for completing the project. They also need to possess the management skills to ensure that the project resources are garnered, deployed and man- aged to complete the project within the planned schedule. Again, poor capabilities on this dimen- sion are reﬂected in project completion delays and schedule slippages. Given the importance of the above capabili- in recent years ﬁrms have placed a great ties, deal of emphasis on software engineering and Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. project management and have been making invest- ments in improving their processes and capabili- ties. The Capability Maturity Model (CMM) devel- oped by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University is a widely adopted framework to improve software capabilities. Built on theories of quality and continuous process improvement, the CMM was ﬁrst initiated to pro- vide the Department of Defense a standard means for measuring contractor capability via its deﬁni- tion of process maturity (Humphrey, 1989). As the CMM became widely adopted as a standard quality process model in the defense sector, commercial organizations also began to investigate whether they could beneﬁt from the approach to software process improvement expressed in the CMM. In the last few years software process improvement based on the CMM has emerged as an integrated solution to the software problems in various cor- porations and empirical evidence in support of the same has been reported (Herbsleb et al., 1997; Krishnan, 1996). Recognizing the importance of project man- agement capabilities, several Indian ﬁrms have been the leaders in adopting CMM guidelines to improve their software development processes. According to SEI, in 2001, of the 42 companies worldwide certiﬁed as having attained a level-5 capability, 25 are based out of India. Meeting these guidelines is not a trivial task. Firms need to make substantial investments in ﬁrm infras- tructure, systems, and human capital. The CMM speciﬁes ﬁve maturity levels, each consisting of several key process areas (KPAs), to assess an organization’s process capability by measuring the degree to which processes are deﬁned and man- aged (see Paulk et al., 1993: Figure 1). Firms ﬁrst need to do a detailed comparison of their devel- opment and project management processes with the CMM process quality framework and identify speciﬁc aspects that need to be improved. After making these organizational and process changes, software ﬁrms need to set up a rigorous metrics program to collect data to assess various aspects of their development process and institute audit sys- tems to track non-conformance of best practices, process deviations, and exceptions. Measurement- based feedback to improve process capability is achieved through monitoring and review forums to track improvements and make required changes on a regular basis. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) 34 S. K. Ethiraj et al. In addition, software ﬁrms need to invest in training programs to improve their process matu- rity under the CMM framework. The training activities mandated by CMM include ongoing training in both new technology and software pro- cess and project management skills for software developers and managers. To achieve higher lev- els of process maturity, ﬁrms need to organize rigorous training of all their employees not only with a view to improve their development/project management practices but also to institutionalize the entire capability improvement initiative (Paulk et al., 1993). The CMM framework offers generic guidelines for institutionalizing disciplined practices across various activities in software development. Since the nature of software development is such that software teams can quickly turn to ad hoc prac- tices, institutionalization of disciplined practices and continuous feedback-based improvements can evolve as a core project management capability of the ﬁrm. Overall, ﬁrms can eventually develop their software development and project manage- ment capabilities as a result of cumulative and integrated effort across the many process areas of CMM as described above. Eventually the pos- session of these capabilities should lead to bet- ter project-level performance for the ﬁrm. Past studies document the relationship between soft- ware and project management capabilities and pro- cesses and the quality of the products/services pro- vided as well as the efﬁciency in providing them (Herbsleb et al., 1997; Krishnan, 1996). Eventu- ally, we believe that these beneﬁts should result in improved project performance in terms of prof- itability. Therefore, we hypothesize: Hypothesis 2: Higher levels of project manage- ment capabilities will lead to higher levels of project performance While client-speciﬁc capabilities and project management capabilities are both positively related to project performance, they might differ in the marginal returns they generate. Even within the set of project management capabilities, it is possi- ble to observe some differences in their marginal returns. As argued earlier, differences in marginal returns may arise due to differences in the costs associated with developing these respective capa- bilities. Our empirical analysis can help shed light on whether that is indeed the case in our setting. Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. To summarize the paper so far: We have sought to understand the origin, signiﬁcance, and value of ﬁrm capabilities. We ﬁrst argued that capabilities reﬂect the distinctive deployment of resources and also that they are contextually grounded. We then elaborated the speciﬁc capabilities that are impor- tant in the software services industry, namely, client-speciﬁc capabilities that arise in the con- text of repeated interactions with clients over time and project management capabilities that develop through deliberate and persistent investments in the effort and infrastructure to create them. While client-speciﬁc capabilities help reduce project exe- cution costs, project management capabilities help maintain low cost and high quality all along the software development and management value chain. These capabilities, in turn, provide oppor- tunities for rent generation for ﬁrms. We next turn our attention to the signiﬁcance and value of these capabilities as a matter for empirical investigation. METHODS Data We obtained detailed quantitative data at the pro- ject level from a leading world-class software services ﬁrm headquartered in India.5 Over 90 percent of its revenues are export-based, of which more than 60 percent comes from North American clients. The dataset includes information on revenues, capability measures, and various project characteristics such as size, client industry, development platform, etc., measured at the project level. inputs, cost, factor We have data on 227 projects executed by the ﬁrm over a 6-year period from 1996 to 2001. How- ever, after dropping single projects and projects with missing data, our sample was reduced to 138 projects.6 The ﬁrm has executed these 138 projects for 57 different clients over the study period. Our dataset has 22 new clients for whom the ﬁrm exe- cuted its ﬁrst project during the study period and 5 Since the dataset reveals the economics of the ﬁrm and has competitive implications, we are unable to reveal the identity of the ﬁrm. 6 We found no statistically signiﬁcant differences between pro- jects with complete data and those with missing data for those variables for which we had complete information. This increased our conﬁdence that the analyzed data were not systematically different from the data on all the projects. The results reported in the paper are estimated using the sample of 138 projects. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) Where Do Capabilities Come From and How Do They Matter? 35 35 repeat clients for whom the ﬁrst project was executed prior to the study period. The average number of projects executed per client is 2.385; the range is from a minimum of 2 to a maximum of 12 projects. Thus, our dataset comprises a panel of 57 clients for whom the ﬁrm has executed two or more projects during the study period. Model speciﬁcation and estimation We assume that the ﬁrm produces a single out- put, software services, using skilled labor. Since the software services business is highly labor- intensive, the scale of the ﬁrm’s operations and its costs depend almost exclusively on manpower. The ﬁrm’s proﬁt function from each project is given by = F (P , C(δ, κ)) πij t where, πij t are the proﬁts from project i for client j in year t. This recognizes that proﬁtability can vary as a function of time, client characteristics, and project characteristics. P are the prices and C are the costs respectively of project i for client j in year t. Both prices and costs depend on project- speciﬁc characteristics, δ, such as size, complexity, duration, and type of contract. The last term in the equation, κ, captures the capabilities measures, which vary with client and time and also depend on project-speciﬁc characteristics δ. This reﬂects our hypotheses that capabilities tend to inﬂuence both the prices and costs of soft- ware services. As argued in the previous section, capabilities allow the ﬁrm to command a price pre- mium (shift the demand curve), and also reduce costs (shift the supply curve). We estimated the following equation using pro- ject-level data: log(πij t ) = β log(wij t ) + χ zij t + γ κij t + ε where the dependent variable, πij t, is project-level contribution (revenue minus cost), wij t is the vec- tor of input characteristics that determine costs, is a vector of project speciﬁc controls, and zij t κij t reﬂect the capability measures. The coefﬁcients on the logged variables are directly interpreted as elasticities, while the coefﬁcients on variables mea- sured in levels vary with the magnitude of the Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. variables.7 We only logged independent variables that did not have zero values and retained vari- ables with zero values as levels to avoid estimation difﬁculties. The equation above cannot be estimated using simple OLS since there are multiple projects per client. Any unobserved relationships among projects for a given client and the consequent heterogeneity across clients can contribute to het- eroskedasticity and bias the standard errors of the coefﬁcient estimates. The standard solution to this problem is either to use a GLS estimator and cor- rect for panel heteroskedasticity or employ OLS and account for the correlations within each panel (Wooldridge, 2002). In using OLS to estimate equations with panel data such as that employed in this paper, the usual practice is to employ a ﬁxed-effects speciﬁcation8 (Greene, 1997). The ﬁxed-effects model involves parameterizing the client-speciﬁc effects by including dummies for each client. We report the results of the estima- tion using, primarily, a ﬁxed-effects speciﬁcation. As a robustness check, we also report GLS with panel heteroskedasticity-corrected standard errors. In the ﬁxed-effects models the coefﬁcient esti- mates are interpreted as the amount of within-panel variation in the dependent variable (project per- formance) that is explained by the within-panel variation in the independent variables. Thus, the regression analysis relates changes in project con- tribution across different projects for a given client to changes in the independent variables after con- trolling for unobserved time-invariant effects, and the included controls. Measures Dependent variable Project contribution. The dependent variable is project contribution (revenues minus costs) mea- sured in Indian rupees (INR) recognized on the date of completion of the project. We chose to 7 We explain our rationale for logging the dependent variable in the following section. Entering the variables in levels does not change the results. We report the results on the logged variables for ease of interpretation. 8 We performed a Hausman test to choose between the random- effects and ﬁxed-effects models. The Hausman test on the full model yielded a chi-squared test statistic equal to 36.22 (p ≤ 0.03), suggesting that the ﬁxed-effects model is preferred over the random-effects model. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) 36 S. K. Ethiraj et al. focus on the project level because the ﬁrm capa- bilities that we study primarily exist and evolve at the project level within ﬁrms. However, ﬁrm proﬁtability is essentially an aggregate of project- level contribution so we expect the correspon- dence between project and ﬁrm proﬁtability to be high. Project proﬁtability is an imperfect indica- tor of ﬁrm proﬁtability to the extent that it does not account for ﬁrm-level cost overheads. To be able to use this measure meaningfully we need to adjust the INR values both for inﬂation and INR–USD (U.S. dollar) exchange rate deprecia- tion over time.9 As we discovered, this is a far from simple problem, since identifying an appro- priate price index speciﬁc to an export-based soft- ware services ﬁrm is quite difﬁcult. Fortunately, we found that a simple solution is to take logs of the dependent variable and include year dummies in the regression estimation. This helps remove the effect of the adjustment factor from the parameters being estimated.10 Independent variables are a capabilities Client-speciﬁc capabilities. As outlined earlier, client-speciﬁc function of repeated interactions with a given client. These repeated interactions may be a function of time (on a long project) or spread over several projects. We measured it in two ways. For each project in our dataset, we have information on whether the client is new (i.e., the ﬁrst project executed for that client) or a repeat client (i.e., the ﬁrm has executed projects for that client in the past). For each project in the dataset, we have a dummy variable, customer type, coded 0 if the ﬁrm has executed projects for the client in the past and coded 1 if it is the ﬁrst project executed for the client. Repeat clients are a proxy for client-speciﬁc capabilities the sign on developed by the ﬁrm. We expect 9 The exchange rate depreciation over time is important since the ﬁrm incurs most of its costs (e.g., wages) in Indian rupees whereas its revenues are in U.S. dollars. Therefore, changes in the rupee–dollar exchange rates will also change the coefﬁcient estimates in the ﬁrm proﬁt function. 10 For example, C2000 (contribution in year 2000) needs to be adjusted to the same units as C1996 (contribution in 1996). Usu- ally, C2000 is adjusted as C2000/P1996, where the denominator (P1996) is the appropriate index for adjustment. Taking logs, we obtain log(C2000)—log(P1996). Thus if we take logs on the dependent variable and include year dummies, the parameters are free of the adjustment factor. The year dummies absorb the adjustment factor, and since the year dummies are only controls the main results and our interpretation remain unaffected. Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. this coefﬁcient will be negative. Since we also have panel data on each client in our sample (i.e., data on multiple projects done for each client), we used it to estimate a client ﬁxed effect by including a dummy variable for each client. Though both measures are largely substitutes, the ﬁrst measure captures some information about past projects not included in our dataset, and the second produces a within-sample estimate of the client-speciﬁc effect. Since we cannot estimate a single parameter for the client ﬁxed effects, we only examine whether they are jointly signiﬁcant after controlling for input and project characteristics and time. Project management capabilities. Project capa- bilities are not client-speciﬁc. They are capabil- ities that can, by deﬁnition, be leveraged across clients, industry domains, and development plat- forms. We used three metric variables to measure project management capabilities. The ﬁrst variable measures the number of in-process defects iden- tiﬁed during the project execution phase. Since in-process defects can vary by size of the project, we normalized it by a project size measure (FP) described below.11 In-process defects, which mea- sure the defects detected in the product, reﬂect a ﬁrm’s software development and management capabilities. Further, there is evidence that the cost of ﬁxing defects in the early phases of software development can be substantially lower than the cost of ﬁxing them in the ﬁnal stages of software development (Jones, 1997). Hence we expect that lower in-process defects will lead to higher project contribution. A second variable measures effort overrun, i.e., difference between actual person-months required to complete the project and person-months that were initially estimated. Effort overrun can affect project proﬁtability since project costs go up as effort increases. This measure reﬂects effort estimation and management capability. Effective project management involves minimizing such overruns. Since effort overrun is likely to vary directly with budgeted person-months, we normal- ized effort overrun by the budgeted person-months to estimate its main effect. The expected sign on this coefﬁcient is negative, i.e., higher effort over- run will lead to lower project contribution. It was 11 The measure of project size, called function points (FP), is a composite measure of project size and complexity and is described in greater detail in the subsection below on the control variables included in the estimation. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) Where Do Capabilities Come From and How Do They Matter? 37 entered as levels (rather than logs) since zero or negative values are possible. A third variable measures the extent of schedule slippage, i.e., delay in project completion date. It reﬂects schedule estimation and management capa- bility. Delays in project completion can adversely affect proﬁtability since the ﬁrm can incur contrac- tual penalties for delays and also bear increased labor costs. We expect the magnitude of sched- ule slippage to vary directly with expected project duration. To control for this, we normalized sched- ule slippage measured in days by project duration (also measured in days). The expected sign on this coefﬁcient is negative, i.e., higher schedule slip- page will lead to lower project contribution. In sum, the capabilities measures employed here reﬂect our view that capabilities are dis- tinct from either inputs or resources. While inputs or resources such as capital or labor are acces- sible by all ﬁrms at prevailing factor prices, capabilities reﬂect the deployment of resources (Makadok, 2001). Therefore, capability differences between ﬁrms are reﬂected in productivity differ- ences between them, and within ﬁrms in produc- tivity improvement over time. Thus, changes in the capability measures reﬂect changes in the produc- tivity of resources over time. Control variables We controlled for a variety of other variables that might impact project proﬁtability. We brieﬂy describe these variables below. Contract type. There are two types of contracts commonly used in the Indian software services industry: time & material (T&M) and ﬁxed price. As explained earlier, the role of project manage- ment capabilities may differ in the two types of contracts. Also, these contracts may vary in terms of their inﬂuence on project proﬁtability. To con- trol for the obvious effect of contract type on proﬁtability we included a dummy variable, where T&M contract was coded 0 and ﬁxed price was coded 1. In terms of the risk–return trade-off ﬁxed price projects are expected to yield superior project proﬁtability, suggesting an expectation of a posi- tive sign on the coefﬁcient. Project size and complexity. We expect project size to affect proﬁtability. Though we have no priors on this, we might reasonably expect that the Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. size–proﬁtability relationship might be increasing below the minimum efﬁcient scale and decreasing above the maximum efﬁcient scale. We employed a measure of project size, called function points (FP), to reﬂect a composite measure of project size and complexity.12 We logged the FP measure in our estimation and, as a result, the coefﬁcient can be interpreted as elasticity with respect to project proﬁtability. Team size. We also expect team size to have an effect on project proﬁtability. As above, we expect project proﬁtability will increase with team size when the team is too small and overworked and decrease when the team size is large enough to create coordination problems. Team size is logged in our model and can be interpreted as elasticity with respect to proﬁtability. Person-months. The team size measure is imper- fect since there may be attrition13 during the project or some members may work only part-time. This will cause the team size measure to be overstated. A more precise measure of project size is person- months of labor. This accounts for both team member attrition and part-time manpower usage. Person-months are entered as logs and can be inter- preted as elasticity with respect to proﬁtability. Project duration. Duration is an important con- trol variable since longer projects are more prone to cost overruns, either due to forecasting difﬁ- culties or employee attrition. We measure project duration as the actual months taken for project completion. This measure is entered in logs and can also be interpreted as elasticity with respect to project proﬁtability. Industry domains. The vendor ﬁrm we studied executed projects for clients in multiple industries. Since competition and appropriability conditions can vary by industry and the vendor’s capabili- ties may not be entirely fungible across industry 12 Earlier measures of size and complexity tended to just count the number of lines of code in software and use it as a proxy. The problem with this measure is that the number of lines of code for a given application varies directly by software platform. For example, for a given application, the number of lines of code in Cobol is several times greater than the number of lines of code in Java. The FP measure is designed to be independent of programming language (see Albrecht and Gaffney, 1983). 13 Employee attrition is historically very high in this industry, ranging from 10 to 30 percent per year. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) 38 S. K. Ethiraj et al. domains, we include industry dummies to con- trol for industry-speciﬁc differences. We included three dummy variables for ﬁnancial services, man- ufacturing, and marketing industries. The omitted category was ‘other.’ Development platforms. Proﬁtability can also depend on the software platform on which the software is coded. The vendor is likely to face lower costs on platforms on which it has executed a number of prior projects and is likely to incur substantial learning and start-up costs on newer platforms. To account for this, we included four dummy variables to distinguish between Windows NT, Mainframe, Unix, and Web-based platforms. The omitted category was ‘other.’ Time. We control for time in all our models using year dummies. The year dummies reﬂect the par- ticular year in which each project was started. (We also tested models using year dummies based on project completion year and found that the results did not change substantively.) This control is necessary to capture the variance in the depen- dent variable due to exchange rate ﬂuctuations and inﬂation. The time dummies are also important to account for any variation in the proportion of onsite and offshore projects that the ﬁrm has done over time. No projects in our dataset were exclu- sively onsite or offshore. Unfortunately, the ﬁrm did not have data at the project level on the pro- portion of work done onsite and offshore. The ﬁrm conﬁrmed that there were no dramatic differences across projects on the mix of onsite and offshore work. However, there has been some change in this mix over time. Thus including the year dummies also helps control for the change in the proportion of onsite and offshore work over time. RESULTS Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics and cor- relation matrix of the variables employed in the estimation. From the correlation matrix it is clear that all the control variables are signiﬁcantly pos- itively related to project contribution. We also note that the relationship between the capability measures and project contribution is negative as expected, though only the process defects variable is statistically signiﬁcant. Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Table 2 presents the coefﬁcient estimates from the ﬁxed-effects panel regression analysis. The sec- ond column lists the predicted sign on the key independent variables in the model. The column labeled Model 1 presents results with just the con- trol variables in the model. The R2 for this model is highly signiﬁcant and the control variables account for about 66 percent of the variance in the data.14 The model also includes the client ﬁxed effects. As expected, the client ﬁxed effect is strongly sig- niﬁcant, providing some prima facie evidence for client-speciﬁc learning and/or switching cost asso- ciated with repeat projects for a given client.15 In Model 2A we added the customer type vari- able to the analysis. The model is again highly signiﬁcant and its adjusted R2 increases to about 0.67. The customer type measure sought to cap- ture aspects of client-speciﬁc capabilities, such as specialized investments and learning from repeated interactions with the client.16 Though the sign on the coefﬁcient was in the expected direction, it was not statistically signiﬁcant. Note, however, that the client ﬁxed effect continues to be highly signiﬁcant even in Model 2A. To investigate the possibility that the client ﬁxed effect might be capturing variance in the cus- tomer type variable, we re-estimated the model by dropping the client ﬁxed effect. Since drop- ping the ﬁxed effect can bias the estimates, we employed a generalized least squares (GLS) model that allowed us to correct for heteroskedasticity within projects executed for a given client. These results, presented in Model 2B, conﬁrm our conjec- ture. The coefﬁcient on the customer type variable is negative and statistically signiﬁcant, suggesting that project contribution, on average, is lower for new clients as compared with repeat clients. This provides some conﬁdence that client-speciﬁc capa- bilities are related to project contribution. 14 We tested for decreasing returns to project and team size by introducing their quadratic powers. The coefﬁcients were non-signiﬁcant, suggesting that the constant returns to scale assumption might be reasonable for this dataset. 15 To check for multicollinearity, we computed the variance inﬂa- tion factor (VIF) indices and found that the person–months variable had a VIF of 4.42, followed by team size (2.97), size FP (2.46), and duration (2.36). The mean VIF for all indepen- dent variables was 2.51, alleviating multicollinearity concerns (Chatterjee, Hadi, and Price, 2000). 16 In the dataset used for empirical estimation there is no evi- dence that revenues from repeat clients were systematically higher than that of ﬁrst-time projects after controlling for project characteristics.

In Model 3A, we included variables for the three project management capabilities. The over- all model continues to be signiﬁcant and accounts for about 70 percent of variance in the data. We ﬁnd that schedule slippage and effort over- run respectively are signiﬁcantly negatively related to project contribution, suggesting that improve- ment in project management capabilities is rent- generating at level. The coefﬁcient for in-process defects is not statistically signiﬁ- cant though its sign is in the expected direction.17 We explored this result in discussions with project the project 17 One reviewer suggested that we enter in-process defects as a binary variable given that the modal value is zero. When entered as a binary (1 or 0) variable, in-process defects was marginally signiﬁcant (at the 10% level). Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. managers. They reasoned that the identiﬁcation of defects during project execution is indeed a capa- bility since defects can be ﬁxed at lower cost during execution than if they were to be ﬁxed after the project was completed. In other words, higher values on the in-process defects measure might indicate better project management skills. On the ﬂip side, they also pointed out that an increase in the number of in-process defects tends to disrupt delivery schedules and negatively impact project proﬁtability. In sum, it seems that while in- process defects do reﬂect detection capability, they also expose some weakness in software design and execution capabilities; namely why these defects arose in the ﬁrst place. In the long run, we expect that defect detection capability might be positively Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) Where Do Capabilities Come From and How Do They Matter? 41 related to project contribution, especially with repeat projects. However, the need to ﬁx defects during project execution can disrupt project sched- ules and increase project costs, leading to the observed result. In Model 3A, we also ﬁnd that the customer type variable remains non-signiﬁcant when the project management capabilities measures are included along with the client ﬁxed effects. Therefore, we again re-estimated the model by dropping the client ﬁxed effects. Model 3B reports the results of the GLS estimation with the correction for panel het- eroskedasticity. Not surprisingly, customer type though only marginally (p ≤ turns signiﬁcant, 0.09). The project management capabilities vari- ables, however, continue to be robustly signiﬁ- cant in the predicted direction. This result seems to suggest that the project management capabili- ties variables share some common variance with the client-speciﬁc capabilities measure. This runs counter to our hypothesis that they are each dis- tinct sets of capabilities. We discussed this result with industry experts, who suggested that by work- ing with a given client over time (i.e., repeat projects) the vendor ﬁrm gains a better understand- ing of the client’s needs and expectations. This, in turn, can help reduce effort overrun and sched- ule slippage accounting for the observed result. The managers in the software ﬁrm we studied tended to agree with this possible interpretation. Finally, we also performed a joint signiﬁcance test of the project management capabilities. We found that the three variables were jointly signiﬁcant (F = 3.23; p ≤ 0.01), reconﬁrming the indepen- dent, additional signiﬁcance of these variables in inﬂuencing project contribution. Models 3A and 3B suggest that decreases in schedule slippage and effort overrun respectively contribute to increases in project contribution. We further analyzed whether and how project man- agement capabilities evolved over time and how that affects contribution.18 We included an interac- tion term of schedule slippage with 1996 (the ﬁrst year of data) and effort overrun with 2001 (the last year of data).19 These results are reported in Model 4. The overall model continues to be highly 18 Ideally we would have liked to examine the evolution of client-speciﬁc capability over time. It was not possible since client-speciﬁc capability is measured as a dummy variable, thus precluding an interaction term with time. 19 We did not include an interaction term with capabilities and time as a continuous measure since this implies the assumption Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. signiﬁcant, accounting for about 72 percent of the variance in the data. As expected, we ﬁnd that the extent of effort overrun on projects is declin- ing over the 1996–2001 period and this decline is positively related to project performance. Con- trary to expectation, we found that schedule slip- page increased marginally during the 1996–2001 period, which adversely affected project contribu- tion in the later years. To understand this result, we examined the data more closely and found three possible reasons that might explain it. First, the vendor steadily increased the number of ﬁxed price projects over the years and did not manage this transition well. As observed in our data, ﬁxed price projects exhibit greater schedule slippage than T&M pro- jects. This is also corroborated in the regres- sion results, where we ﬁnd T&M projects, con- trary to expectations, to be more proﬁtable than ﬁxed price projects. Second, in the ﬁxed price projects we found a greater difference between the team size and person-months measures. While team size reﬂects the maximum number of per- sons who worked on a given project, the person- months measure captures actual labor input in the project. At one extreme, if all members of the team worked full the team size and person-months would be identical. The divergence in the two measures appears when there is high turnover in the project teams. We found that the difference between the two mea- sures increased over the years, suggesting that an increase in project team turnover might account for the increase in schedule slippage. During the 1996–2001 period, the attrition due to employee resignations ﬂuctuated between 9 and 16 percent. Increase in turnover directly contributes to sched- ule slippages since there is a set-up cost when new employees enter a project mid-way. Our discussions with company executives revealed a third reason for increase in schedule slippage: time on a given project that capabilities change linearly over time. We found no theo- retical or empirical basis for such an assumption. Our results, however, are robust to including year as a continuous variable. However, we were unable to include both interactions in the same model. The high correlations between the two interac- tion terms created estimation difﬁculties. Similarly, including an interaction effect of both capability measures with the same year (i.e., 1996 or 2001) created estimation problems since they were highly correlated. We switched the years to avoid this prob- lem. For completeness, an interaction of schedule slippage with 2001 is negative and signiﬁcant, which is consistent with our interpretation. Strat. Mgmt.

The e-commerce clients, in their effort to speedily set up their Web infrastructure, set aggressive project completion schedules that were difﬁcult for the company to meet. One or more of these three explanations account for the observed increase in schedule slippage that in turn contributed to reduced project proﬁtability. DISCUSSION We sought to examine two interrelated research questions in this paper: Where do capabilities come from and how do they affect ﬁrm perfor- mance? We made three main arguments in address- ing these questions. First, we suggested that capa- bilities involve the deployment of resources and they evolve over time through the joint effects of deliberate, persistent ﬁrm-speciﬁc investments and learning-by-doing. Second, we proposed that capabilities are context-speciﬁc and, therefore, we need to conceptualize and study them accordingly. In this paper, we looked at the software services industry and identiﬁed two important capabili- ties at the project level: client-speciﬁc capabilities and project management capabilities. Third, we argued that improvement in capabilities will result in improved project proﬁtability and that different capabilities yield different marginal beneﬁts. Our results are broadly supportive of our hy- potheses. In the software services industry we ﬁnd that capabilities contribute positively to project performance. The empirical evidence for the im- portance of client-speciﬁc capabilities was only modest. In models that included client ﬁxed effects we did not ﬁnd support for the effect of client- speciﬁc capabilities on contribution. However, in models that did not include the client ﬁxed effect, we found that projects for new clients, on aver- age, yield approximately 2 percent lower contri- bution than projects for repeat clients. In models including the client ﬁxed effect, it appears that the dummy variable capturing repeat or new clients is too coarse a measure to adequately reﬂect client- speciﬁc capabilities. An ideal measure of client- speciﬁc capabilities is a historical count of all the projects executed for a client (not just a count of projects within the sample period). Unfortu- nately, the ﬁrm was unable to provide these data. Nevertheless, the signiﬁcance of the client-speciﬁc Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. capabilities measure in the GLS model is indica- tive and might be useful to examine carefully in future research. In addition, we believe that the client ﬁxed effect might be also picking up some variance in the learning associated with repeated interaction with clients (Anand and Khanna, 2000). Project management capabilities were gener- ally predictive of higher project contribution. Two of the three measures of project manage- ment capabilities were statistically signiﬁcant. A 1 percent increase in schedule slippage resulted in a 0.6 percent decline in project contribution.20 A 1 percent increase in effort overrun causes a 0.1 percent decline in project contribution. It seems that the effect of effort overruns just increases labor cost and causes less damage to project contribution, whereas increases in sched- ule slippage triggers two independent and addi- tive increases in cost: labor costs and contractual penalties for late completion. Our results suggest that although both types of capabilities, namely schedule estimation and management, and effort estimation are signiﬁcantly related to performance, the former makes a higher marginal contribution to performance. Therefore, our results suggest that ﬁrms may be better off erring on the side of cau- tion and overstafﬁng their project teams rather than facing the prospect of a schedule slippage. Finally, we found some evidence for the evo- lution of capabilities over time and its impact on project contribution. We found that a tighter con- trol of effort overrun in projects in 2001 resulted in better project contribution as compared with projects in 1996–2000. On the other hand, we found that an increase in schedule slippage from 1997 to 2001 has had a signiﬁcant negative effect on project contribution.21 This raises the value of improving the capability to better forecast sched- ules and stick to them. We believe our study of ﬁrm capabilities and their effects on performance in the software services industry raises several important issues. First, our study has sought to make the case that identifying the capabilities that are the sources of performance differences need to be contextually 20 The semi-elasticities for the coefﬁcients on the capabilities = ∂F (X, β)/∂Xi βi with all the measures were computed as mi variables ﬁxed at their means. 21 We avoid calculating semi-elasticities for the interaction terms. The typically high correlations between the main effect and the interaction effect result in imprecisely estimated coefﬁcients. As a result, computing accurate economic signiﬁcance of these coefﬁcients becomes difﬁcult. Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) Where Do Capabilities Come From and How Do They Matter? 43 It that seems grounded. Each industry is driven by its own demand- and supply-side economics, which also changes over time. It is important to take this into account while identifying and measuring capabilities. there are indeed signiﬁcant differences in the way the same ﬁrm deploys its resources, both across projects and over time. Holding project inputs and characteristics constant we found that an improvement in project management capabilities resulted in increases in project contribution. Put simply, our results demonstrate that project proﬁtability differences could be a function of differences in the way the same resources are deployed by the ﬁrm. Also, we found some evidence that an improvement in the productive deployment of resources over time yielded increases in project proﬁtability. This provides reason to take more seriously Penrose’s (1959) key insight that differential ﬁrm capabilities in productively deploying resources lie at the heart of ﬁrm performance differences. Second, it appears that measuring capabilities at more micro levels within a ﬁrm is quite promis- ing. It not only helps better estimate their eco- nomic signiﬁcance but also provides clear guide- lines to the ﬁrm on where and how it needs to improve its capabilities. Measures of capabil- ities at the aggregate ﬁrm level, while useful in identifying between-ﬁrm differences, provide lit- tle understanding of the micro-foundations of such inter-ﬁrm differences. As our study demonstrates, measurement of ﬁrm capabilities at the micro- level holds promise of enhancing our understand- ing ‘how’ and ‘why’ some ﬁrms perform better than others. Lastly, our analyses also show that the marginal returns to different capabilities are not uniform. Given scarce managerial resources, it is useful for ﬁrms ﬁrst to identify the capabilities that provide the highest marginal returns to performance and then direct the bulk of its resources to acquir- ing them. Building capabilities requires signiﬁ- cant and, often, irreversible commitment of real resources, both ﬁnancial and managerial. Deci- sions about which capabilities to acquire or build require due diligence in the analysis of costs and beneﬁts. Moreover, it is likely that different ﬁrms will face different costs and beneﬁts of acquiring the same capabilities given the interdependencies with various other organizational choices (Ethi- raj and Levinthal, 2004). For instance, for a ﬁrm that engages in relatively few repeat projects, the Copyright  2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. marginal beneﬁt of client-speciﬁc capabilities is likely to be signiﬁcantly less than the marginal beneﬁt of project management capabilities (this would generally be the case for smaller or newer ﬁrms who are likely to have fewer repeat clients in their early years). The converse is likely to be true in the case of a ﬁrm that engages in a large number of repeat projects. In fact, the latter set of ﬁrms could also explore the feasibility of investing in creating deliberate and institutionalized mecha- nisms to build their client-speciﬁc capabilities than leaving it to tacit learning-by-doing. Our inter- views seem to support this contention. Finally, in our dataset, if we assume that the marginal cost of acquiring different project management capa- bilities is the same, our results suggest that the ﬁrm would be well advised to expend resources to improve schedule estimation and management capabilities so as to tightly manage schedule slip- pages. Improvements in this capability promise to yield higher marginal improvement in project con- tribution performance. LIMITATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH In this paper we attempted to uncover the micro- foundations of capabilities and how they affect per- formance. Our study, like any study, suffers from some limitations. First, it is based on a single ser- vice industry with its own peculiar characteristics. It is not clear to what extent the substantive results of this paper are generalizable across industries. At the same time, as we have asserted above, capa- bilities are usually context-speciﬁc, i.e., industry- speciﬁc, and capabilities that are generalizable across industries are likely to be overly abstract and less useful as a guide to managerial action. A second limitation is that our study is based on data from a single ﬁrm. Ideally, we would have liked to include data from a few more ﬁrms. However, getting access to such detailed data of great com- petitive signiﬁcance is a difﬁcult challenge. In our case, this involved several years of data collection, ongoing negotiations with the ﬁrm concerned, and the signing of non-disclosure agreements. Third, since our analysis is based on data from only one ﬁrm we could not make any explicit inter-ﬁrm comparisons of competitive advantage. However, since the ﬁrm is among the top ﬁve ﬁrms in the industry on several dimensions such as growth Strat. Mgmt. J., 26: 25–45 (2005) 44 S. K. Ethiraj et al. and total revenues it gives us some conﬁdence for drawing the capabilities–performance link. In spite of some of the data limitations out- lined above, some of the unique aspects of our dataset outweigh some of these disadvantages. One, the data on resource inputs (team size, experi- ence, etc.) and capabilities allow us to empirically measure Penrose’s (1959) key distinction between available resources (factor inputs such as labor) and how they are deployed (i.e., productivity of resources). Two, the data on project-level contri- bution suffer from relatively fewer problems asso- ciated with aggregate accounting data. Finally, our design allowed us to combine the depth and rich- ness of longitudinal, single-ﬁrm case studies with the rigor of large-sample empirical estimation. In conclusion, the paper attempted to take an initial step in teasing out the importance of capabil- ities and estimating their impact on performance. We hope that the spirit of this paper in advocating the importance of contextually grounded studies of ﬁrm capabilities will spur further research along these lines in other industries. The shift in research focus from whether or not capabilities matter to ‘what’ capabilities matter and ‘how’ they matter promises to enrich our understanding of ﬁrm prof- itability differences.
